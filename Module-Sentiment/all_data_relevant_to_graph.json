Century Wire says\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nIn early 2015, Big Pharma has declared war on vaccine dissent. In case you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t noticed over the last two weeks, US media outlets are running a highly coordinated and sensationalized propaganda campaign to hype-up a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national measles outbreak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while demonizing any American parents that dare to question the efficacy and safety of any mass-produced vaccine product.\nBack in 2000, the CDC announced that the United States achieved measles elimination. Since then, cases have been recorded in the US each year, culminating in 2014 where the CDC claims to have tracked 644 cases. Where are these cases really coming from? Clearly, measles do exist, but can they rightly say that recent cases in 2014 and 2015 constitute a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national outbreak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd?\nThere is a visible backlash happening against parents who are challenging government and corporate vaccine orthodoxy. The US media\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmandatory vaccination\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 PR campaign was successfully launched nationwide following an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outbreak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd incident at Disneyland, the Walt Disney theme park brand on January 7th (see the timeline of events here).\nAs a popular and recognizable children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brand,\u00c2\u00a0Disneyland was crucial in propelling successful headlines that boldly declared, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Disneyland Measles Outbreak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Even the President endorsed the campaign stating, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is every reason to get vaccinated \u00e2\u20ac\u201d there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reasons to not,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Barack Obama told Today on Monday.\nToday, CNN took an even more aggressive stance in promoting what the network is now touting as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153federal mandate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nCNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sanjay Gupta pressed hard on the new US Surgeon General Vivek Murphy about how vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not cause autism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Host Jake Tapper continued heaping on the narrative by claiming, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When they [parents] opt-out [of vaccines] they put not only their children but other children at risk too\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Tapper later insisted that the federal government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153needs to convince\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd parents that all vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are safe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The messaging being pushed here is as follows: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153measles are currently ravaging the US and so we need all children to receive ALL vaccines mandated by the state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That could total up to 49 or more vaccines per child.\nWhat US authorities and media are hiding from the public is a disturbing phenomenon where the measles infection is actually spread through MMR (live measles-mumps-rubella vaccine). See a full and detailed report on this below.\n FEAR CAMPAIGN: The media used the family-friendly Disney brand to hype-up a non-existent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national outbreak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nThe reality, just like the US-based Ebola Hoax, is that there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational outbreak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The CDC is currently promoting the idea that 2014 was a record year for measles in the US with approximately 644 cases out of a US population of 320 million. What the media is not telling you (surprise, surprise) is that the majority of those 644 plus cases originated from two specific sources: an Amish community and a group of travelers who entered the US from the Philippines. So when you eliminate those two sources, there was no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcupward trend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at all in the US in 2014.\nIn fact, the CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own 2014 reports state: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The U.S. experienced 23 measles outbreaks in 2014, including one large outbreak of 383 cases, occurring primarily among unvaccinated Amish communities in Ohio. Many of the cases in the U.S. in 2014 were associated with cases brought in from the Philippines, which experienced a large measles outbreak. For more information see the Measles in the Philippines Travelers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Health Notice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nRegardless of the details and facts, the US media are touting the latest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoutbreak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in California, citing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153102 children in California\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who have been detected with measles, leading audiences to believe that these just cropped-up from nowhere and were a direct result of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unvaccinated children\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who gave measles to other \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvulnerable children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Since the Disneyland outbreak story was released, US media outlets, including CNN, have been aggressively promoting the livestock term, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, effectively labeling American children as a\u00c2\u00a0herd of animals. Media and CDC spokespersons appearing on TV are insisting that this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcherd immunity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is merely the collective level of inoculation that protects even the unvaccinated.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHerd Mentality\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\nIn reality, what the media are promoting is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd mentality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, ignoring how parents used to bring their young children together to catch chicken pox and measles etc, to guarantee lifetime immunity for their children. Of course, this is bad business for vaccine manufacturers who prefer that you pay them for a vaccine which will actually increase a recipient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of contracting the said virus (see report below).\nThe psychological operation being deployed \u00c2\u00a0here is fairly obvious \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a0first to berate and shame, and then to scare American parents into compliance with central government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a government that appears to be in collusion with Big Pharma on this issue. The message is clear: any parents who might have genuine personal and family health concerns regarding risky vaccines, are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153putting the public safety at risk and therefore must comply\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the wake of this crisis, US media are currently promoting a new class of laws that will eliminate a parent and student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to obtain a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwaiver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for mandatory vaccinations. In other words, if you do not get all the vaccines which the state demands, then you will be breaking the law.\nMeanwhile, the vaccine industry is funding their own studies which claim that their products are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\nAlso, the media appear to be subtly working to characterize measles as a fatal disease, when in reality, the vast majority of measles infections will run their course in just 7-10 days. Again, according to the CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own records, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrecord-breaking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 2014 year which cited 644 cases, had ZERO deaths from measles. Contrast this to the Flu (influenza), where annual US deaths can range from anywhere between 3,000 and 49,000 per year, and it becomes clear that characterizing a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmeasles epidemic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the US is a complete fabrication.\nWith Disneyland media scare, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now been established at least half of the Disneyland children who allegedly caught measles WERE vaccinated. So what is really going on here?\nAs expected, the real story is the complete opposite of what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re being told\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n20 years ago, the MMR vaccine was found to infect virtually all of its recipients with measles. The manufacturer Merck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own product warning links MMR to a potentially fatal form of brain inflammation caused by measles. Why is this evidence not being reported?\nThe phenomenon of measles infection spread by MMR (live measles-mumps-rubella vaccine) has been known for decades. In fact, 20 years ago, scientists working at the CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Center for Infectious Diseases, funded by the WHO and the National Vaccine Program, discovered something truly disturbing about the MMR vaccine: it leads to detectable measles infection in the vast majority of those who receive it.\nPublished in 1995 in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology and titled, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Detection of Measles Virus RNA in Urine Specimens from Vaccine Recipients,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd researchers analyzed urine samples from newly MMR vaccinated 15-month-old children and young adults and reported their eye-opening results as following:\nThe authors of this study used a relatively new technology at that time, namely, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which they believed could help resolve growing challenges associated with measles detection in the shifting post-mass immunization epidemiological and clinical landscape. These challenges include:\nTwenty years later, PCR testing is widely acknowledged as highly sensitive and specific, and the only efficient way to distinguish vaccine-strain and wild-type measles infection, as their clinical presentation are indistinguishable.\nDid the CDC Use PCR Testing On The Disneyland Measles Cases?\n The latest measles outbreak at Disney is a perfect example of where PCR testing could be used to ascertain the true origins of the outbreak. The prior assumption that the non-vaccinated are carriers and transmitters of a disease, and that the vaccinated are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimmune\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has not been scientifically validated. Since vaccine strain measles has almost entirely supplanted wild-type, communally acquired measles, it is statistically unlikely that PCR tests will reveal the media\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hysterical storyline \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-vaxxers brought back an eradicated disease!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0 to be true. Until such studies are performed and exposed, we will never know for certain.\nLaura Hayes, of Age of Autism, recently addressed this key question in her insightful article \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Disney, Measles, and the Fantasyland of Vaccine Perfection\u00e2\u20ac\u0153:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Has there been any laboratory confirmation of even one case of the supposed measles related to Disneyland?\u00c2\u00a0 If yes, was the confirmed case tested to determine whether it was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwild-type measles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or vaccine-strain measles? If not, why not?\nThese are important questions to ask. Is it measles or not? If yes, what kind, because if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccine-strain measles, then that means it is the vaccinated who are contagious and spreading measles resulting in what the media likes to label \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outbreaks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to create panic (a panic more appropriately triggered by our 25 year history of epidemic autism). It would be what one might call vaccine fallout.\u00c2\u00a0 People who receive live-virus vaccines, such as the MMR, can then shed that live virus, for up to many weeks and can infect others.\u00c2\u00a0 Other live-virus vaccines include the nasal flu vaccine, shingles vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, chicken pox vaccine, and yellow fever vaccine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAdditional Evidence That the Vaccinated Are Not Immune, Spread Disease\nThe National Vaccine Information Center has published an important document relevant to this topic titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Emerging Risks of Live Virus & Virus Vectored Vaccines: Vaccine Strain Virus Infection, Shedding & Transmission.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pages 34-36 in the section on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Measles, Mumps, Rubella Viruses and Live Attenuated Measles, Mumps, Rubella Viruses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd discuss evidence that the MMR vaccine can lead to measles infection and transmission\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nREAD MORE VACCINE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Vaccine Files\n","1":"Paul Offit, MD, is director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital of Philadelphia. He has published more than 160 papers in medical and scientific journals in the areas of rotavirus-specific immune responses and vaccine safety. He spoke with Berkeley Wellness about why the anti-vaccine movement is so dangerous to public health. \nHow many parents choose not to get their kids vaccinated?\n Roughly one to two percent of parents choose not to vaccinate their children at all. Between 10 and 20 percent delay or withhold certain vaccinations. What those numbers tell us is that many children are being put at risk of serious, preventable diseases. \nDo unvaccinated children pose a risk to other children?\n Of course. The best example is last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measles outbreak, which started in southern California and spread to 25 states and parts of Canada. Before that outbreak, there was a report by an investigative reporter named Gary Baum. He went from school to school in southern California and found that some elementary schools had vaccination rates less than 50 percent. He wrote an article predicting that this could become the epicenter of measles outbreak. He published it in what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not thought to be a classic medical journal, the Hollywood Reporter. And he was absolutely right. When you start seeing a fraying of herd immunity, you begin to see outbreaks, starting with the most contagious diseases. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen: measles, mumps, and whooping cough outbreaks. \nWhat is herd immunity?\n Call it community immunity. If you get a high enough population of people immunized, then the virus or bacteria will no longer be able to spread. That number doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be 100 percent. We started to eliminate polio in this country once we got to about 70 percent. The percentage needed depends on the contagiousness of the virus or bacteria. When we fall short of that number, then you put children who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be immunized at risk. About 500,000 people in the US can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be vaccinated. They may be on immune-suppressing therapy for chronic diseases, for example, or on chemotherapy for cancer. They depend on others to get vaccinated in order to be protected. California recently passed a law, SB-277, that eliminates all non-medical exemptions, including religious and philosophical exemptions. That law passed in part because a little six-year-old boy with leukemia, who couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be vaccinated, stood up at a meeting and said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What about me? I depend on the people around me to protect me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \nWhy are some parents reluctant to get their children vaccinated?\n Partly because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no longer scared of these diseases, since we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see much of them anymore. And often they get bad information from the Internet that makes them afraid of things they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to fear. In the case of measles, in 1998, a now-repudiated researcher named Andrew Wakefield published a paper linking measles vaccine to autism. There was no biological explanation and virtually no data. The paper should never have been published. But the media jumped all over it. The paper has since been retracted. But the fear it created still convinces people to make dangerous decisions for their children. \nA lot of misinformation is based on anecdotal evidence. Why is anecdotal evidence so powerful, even in the face of scientific findings?\n Anecdotal evidence is a contradiction in terms. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an emotional, personal experience, but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t evidence. My child was fine. My child got vaccinated and now my child is not fine. The vaccine did it. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not evidence. Let me give you an example. My wife is a physician in private practice. She was in the office helping the nurse give immunizations. While my wife was filling a syringe with vaccine, getting ready to give the inoculation, a four-month-old child in her mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lap had a seizure and went on to have epilepsy. If my wife had given that vaccine 5 minutes earlier, the mother would have been convinced that the vaccine caused the seizure. You could present reams of scientific data showing that that particular vaccine doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t increase the risk of seizures, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to convince a mother who says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I saw what I saw.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reasonable enough to ask if the vaccine was responsible. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an answerable question. You can do studies to find out. You look at large numbers of children who did or didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get vaccinated and look at rates of autism. And when we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done those studies, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no association between vaccination and autism. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real scientific evidence. \nAre religious beliefs one reason some people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get their kids vaccinated?\n Unfortunately, yes. In 1991, in Philadelphia, where I live, an outbreak of measles began that was centered around two fundamentalist churches that refused to vaccinate their children. Over the course of three months, there were 1400 cases of measles and nine deaths. The city was in a panic. It was a horrifying time. I wrote the book Bad Faith: When Religious Belief Undermines Modern Medicine, and especially a chapter called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Unto Others,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd partly to exorcise the demons of that experience. The idea of a religious exemption not to vaccinate your child is the equivalent of a religious exemption to practice child abuse. How is it a religious act to expose your child to harm? It seems to me quite the opposite. Choosing not to get your child vaccinated is not a risk-free decision. Anyone who works in a large urban hospital, as I do, sees children die of vaccine-preventable diseases on a yearly basis. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a terrible thing to see.\n I understand their concern. We have vaccines to prevent 14 childhood diseases.They may require 26 separate inoculations in the first few years of life to prevent diseases that most people have never seen, using biological fluids that most people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising that parents are afraid. I respect that. What I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respect is when hundreds of millions of dollars are spent for studies that show that those fears are ungrounded, and people ignore the evidence and put their children at risk. \n In the 21st century, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re of the belief that we can master anything. With the Internet, we think we can learn as much as we need to know by going online. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the case. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to decide whether to give your child the chickenpox vaccine. You look at people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinions on the Internet, and you call that research. In fact, if you want to do research on the chickenpox vaccine, you have to read the roughly 300 papers that have been published on the chickenpox vaccine. For that, you would need some expertise in virology, immunology, statistics, and epidemiology. Few parents have that. Few doctors have that. So we turn to panels of experts who collectively have that expertise, people who carefully evaluate the evidence and make the best recommendations on chickenpox vaccination. That message\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtrust us, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re experts\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis not one that sells in the 21st century. But in fact, if you want the best medical advice, turn to the experts. \n We should do what California just did, and eliminate all non-medical exemptions. Among states, Mississippi has the highest vaccination rate, over 99 percent. Why? Because they have no non-medical exemptions. In a better world, information wins. You provide people with reliable information, presented in a compelling way, and they make the best choice. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always happen. Then you need to compel people to do what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give people the option to do something that will hurt their children. You require them to do it. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it works with seatbelts. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a religious or philosophical exemption and not strap your kid in. We compel people to do it because we know it will save lives. And we know that vaccinations will save many, many lives.\n","2":" This week, the World Health Organization kicks off World Immunization Week \"to promote the use of vaccines to protect people of all ages against disease.\" \n In the U.S., overall vaccination compliance remains high for many childhood immunizations, with at least 90 percent of children getting the recommended vaccinations on time for measles\/mumps\/rubella, polio and chickenpox, according to a 2015 report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n However, the CDC found other vaccination rates fell below its target for what's known as herd immunity, or a population's resistance to the spread of a disease that results when a high percentage of individuals are immune. This included below than ideal vaccination rates for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (80 percent), hepatitis B (89 percent), and the gastrointestinal disease rotavirus (68 percent). \n In recent years, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles or pertussis have made headlines, revealing how pockets of unvaccinated or undervaccinated people may still present a problem. \n The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has been documenting outbreaks -- here's a look at some past and current outbreaks, and how health officials are responding. \n In the last year, there has been a huge upswing in the number of mumps cases in the U.S. In 2016, there were multiple outbreaks of the mumps resulting in 5,748 total reported cases in the U.S. Comparatively, there were just 229 cases in 2015. Washington state has had 771 mumps cases since the start of an outbreak last October. \n Earlier this month, Texas reported an outbreak of mumps that infected 221, the highest number since 1994, when 234 cases were reported, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. \n Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said in an earlier interview that the recent mumps outbreaks appear to be occurring in populations with high vaccination rates. \n \"Although people are vaccinated, after about 15 years, there is some waning of immunity and if you get a strong exposure that exposure can overcome that diminished protection and you'll get a case of mumps,\" said Schaffner. \n The CDC has confirmed that its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is reviewing vaccinations for mumps and considering recommending a booster shot during an outbreak. \n There have been multiple measles outbreaks in recent years that have infected hundreds in Ohio, California and Minnesota, according to the AAP. On Monday, the Minnesota Department of Health reported at least 20 children under the age of 5 have been infected with the virus. Currently, 16 of these children have been confirmed to be unvaccinated against the virus. \n Once a measles outbreak starts in an area with low vaccinations, it can be difficult to control, according to the CDC. Measles is one of the most infectious viruses in existence. It will infect 90 percent of susceptible people if they are exposed. The airborne virus can also remain in the air for hours, infecting people if they are in the same vicinity as someone who is ill, according to the CDC. \n The measles virus was declared eradicated from the U.S. in 2000 and reached an all-time low with just 37 cases in 2004. \n Whooping cough or pertussis has been significantly reduced by vaccines but continues to occur, since the vaccine's effectiveness decreases over time. Approximately four years after getting a vaccine for whooping cough, just three or four out of 10 people are protected against the virus, according to the CDC. \n The CDC reports that there are between 10,000 to 40,000 cases of pertussis every year and up to 20 deaths. \n In California, a massive outbreak of pertussis infected 9,934 in 2014. Just two years earlier, Washington state reported 2,530 cases, according to the AAP. \n There has been some good news on the vaccination front. This month, California reported that the vaccination rate for kindergarteners had hit \"a new high,\" rising from 93 to 96 percent after the state government made it tougher for parents to opt out of vaccination compliance. \n Art Caplan, head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU School of Medicine at the Langone Medical Center, said the state of vaccination success in the U.S. is \"mixed\" but that California has been a bright spot. \n \"They've done an amazing job and one that might inspire other states in getting better reduction in the measles,\" Caplan said, who co-authored the book \"Vaccination Ethics and Policy.\" \n In Marin County, where much of the pertussis outbreak had spread in 2014, the vaccination rate has climbed dramatically from 77.9 percent of kindergarteners being in compliance to 93.2 percent today.\n","3":"A year ago, Robert De Niro pulled the highly controversial anti-vaccine movie \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVAXXED: From Cover Up To Controversy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the Tribeca film festival held in NYC.\nIt was a wise decision that was inspired by the outrage of the other filmmakers involved in\u00c2\u00a0the festival and applauded by the scientific community. \u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, what happened next was disheartening.\nAlmost immediately following the announcement to exclude the film, De Niro publicly questioned the decision and, in doing so, lent support to the fraudulent and dangerous anti-vaccine movement.

According to the prevailing propaganda it is fringe religious communities, visitors from countries where measles is common, and vaccine objectors within the United States, that are responsible for the failure of the measles vaccine to confer lasting immunity.\nLooking at the rising tide of vaccine resistant infectious outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad \u00e2\u20ac\u201d chickenpox, shingles, mumps, whooping cough (pertussis), influenza, HPV (Gardasil), hepatitis B, to name but a few \u00e2\u20ac\u201d through the lens of the peer-reviewed and published literature on the topic, it is clear that the vaccines, and not those who refuse to subject themselves to them, are at the root of the problem. And nowhere is this more clearly evident than in the measles vaccine.\nHow do we know this?\nJust a few months ago, a study published in PLoS titled, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Difficulties in eliminating measles and controlling rubella and mumps: a cross-sectional study of a first measles and rubella vaccination and a second measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd brought to light the glaring ineffectiveness of two measles vaccines (measles\u00e2\u20ac\u201crubella (MR) or measles\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmumps\u00e2\u20ac\u201crubella (MMR) ) in fulfilling their widely claimed promise of preventing outbreaks in highly vaccine compliant populations.

Measles outbreaks have consistently occurred in highly immunization compliant populations.

School records indicated that 98.7% of students were appropriately vaccinated, leading the researchers to conclude: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This outbreak suggests that measles transmission may persist in some settings despite appropriate implementation of the current measles elimination strategy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd2 \n1988, Colorado, USA: According to an article published in the American Journal of Public Health in 1991, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153early 1988 an outbreak of 84 measles cases occurred at a college in Colorado in which over 98 percent of students had documentation of adequate measles immunity \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 due to an immunization requirement in effect since 1986. They concluded: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6measles outbreaks can occur among highly vaccinated college populations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd3 \n1989, Quebec, Canada: According to an article published in the Canadian Journal of Public Health in 1991, a 1989 measles outbreak was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153largely attributed to an incomplete vaccination coverage,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but following an extensive review the researchers concluded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Incomplete vaccination coverage is not a valid explanation for the Quebec City measles outbreak.4 \n 1991-1992, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: According to an article published in the journal Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical, in a measles outbreak from March 1991 to April 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, 76.4% of those suspected to be infected had received measles vaccine before their first birthday.5\n1992, Cape Town, South Africa: According to an article published in the South African Medical Journal in 1994, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[In] August 1992 an outbreak occurred, with cases reported at many schools in children presumably immunised.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Immunization coverage for measles was found to be 91%, and vaccine efficacy found to be only 79%, leading them to conclude that primary and secondary vaccine failure was a possible explanation for the outbreak.6\nThese six outbreaks are by no means exhaustive of the biomedical literature, but illustrate just how misled the general public is about the effectiveness of measles vaccines, and the CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccination agenda in general. No amount of historical ignorance will erase the fact that vaccination does not equal immunization; antigenicity does not equal immunogenicity.\nThe superstitious and ironically non-evidence-based faith in the infallibility of vaccines speaks volumes as to why the growing movement to educate the public about the true nature of vaccines is increasingly labeled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-vaccine,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when in fact it is pro-vaccine awareness, namely, making the public aware of vaccine failures and the growing plight of the countless vaccine injured around the world.\nUNICEF and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation can continue to label those who bring the peer-reviewed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153child killers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as Bill Gates did in a CNN interview with Dr. Sanjay Gupta. But all this does is to increase the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suspicion of the real agenda behind their ostensibly charitable plea to save the poor and the needy from the hell of disease, instead of focusing on improving their most basic living conditions, nutrition, sanitation, refrigeration, etc., and making inroads to reduce the geopolitical violence that is ruining the lives of hundreds of millions.\nMeasles is a real disease with real adverse health effects, some of which can be life threatening in the already immunocompromised (vaccination representing a major cause of TH1\/TH2 imbalances). But it is our immune status, as with all infectious diseases, that determines susceptibility and whether or not a disease will be mild or lethal. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate away conditions that lead to compromised immunity, nor can you \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimmunize\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 folks \u00e2\u20ac\u201d especially parents \u00e2\u20ac\u201d against the desire to pursue the truth about vaccines.\nLearn more on our research vaccine database: Health Guide: Vaccine Research.\n1T L Gustafson, A W Lievens, P A Brunell, R G Moellenberg, C M Buttery, L M Sehulster.

Is it measles or not? If yes, what kind, because if it's vaccine-strain measles, then that means it is the vaccinated who are contagious and spreading measles resulting in what the media likes to label \"outbreaks\" to create panic (strange how they've completely missed the Autism outbreak going on for the past 25 years). It would be what one might call vaccine fallout.\u00c2\u00a0 People who receive live-virus vaccines, such as the MMR, can then shed that live virus, for up to many weeks...and can infect others.\u00c2\u00a0 Multiply that in your head by all of the people who receive not only the MMR live-virus vaccine, but many others. Other live-virus vaccines include the nasal flu vaccine, shingles vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, chicken pox vaccine, and yellow fever vaccine.\nIt has recently been discovered that those who are vaccinated with the DTaP and TDaP vaccines, if subsequently exposed to and infected with pertussis, can then harbor pertussis in their throats, for weeks, which can then spread to others causing them to contract pertussis, even if the one harboring it in their throat remains asymptomatic.\u00c2\u00a0 Talk about a hidden disease vector!\u00c2\u00a0 Parents of infants should be wary of those who've received either of these vaccines, because if a DTaP or TDaP recipient is infected with pertussis, they may not know it, and since they might not have the telling cough, then no one else has any way to know they might be contagious and transmitting pertussis, either.\u00c2\u00a0 This certainly dismantles the \"cocooning\" theory that has been used to scare parents of newborns and infants into not permitting any adult, including Grandma and Grandpa, near their baby who hasn't had a TDaP booster.\nThus, it is often\u00c2\u00a0the vaccinated\u00c2\u00a0who are spreading disease, despite what the media tell you, media that are heavily supported and influenced by pharmaceutical advertising dollars.\u00c2\u00a0 Why aren't those who receive live-virus vaccines quarantined in their homes until it can be confirmed that they are no longer contagious with the diseases against which they were vaccinated? Why are they being allowed into schools, hospitals, grocery stores, and the like?\u00c2\u00a0 Why are those who have received the DTaP and TDaP vaccines not mandated to be tested for pertussis being harbored in their throats before being allowed near newborns and infants?\n2.\u00c2\u00a0 Did you know that historical statistical figures for reported measles cases have been fraught with error? \u00c2\u00a0For but one example, I will refer to doctor-diagnosed \"measles\" cases in the UK in the late 1990s, where a serious problem emerged.\u00c2\u00a0 A government scientist discovered that only 1 in 40 reported cases of measles was actually confirmed to be measles after lab testing. This discovery throws into question historical, and current, figures for measles. If reported cases are not required to be lab-confirmed, then this scientist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s discovery would lead us to believe that there has been gross over-reporting of measles cases, past and present.\nDaily Telegraph 8 January 1997 London (Europe Today): \"97.5% of the times that British doctors diagnose measles they are wrong\", says a publication of the Public Health Laboratory service. The mistake being made by National Health GP's was found when the services tested the saliva of more than 12,000 children who had been diagnosed as having measles. Roger Buttery, an adviser on transmissible diseases at the Cambridge and Huntingdon Health Department, said that the majority of doctors \"say they can recognize measles a mile off, but we now know that this illness occurs only in 2.5% of the cases.\" Buttery says that doctors classify as measles many other viruses that also cause spots. He found eight different viruses during the survey in East Anglia. One of them, parvovirus, gives symptoms similar to German measles. The reason for the high rate of error puzzled Buttery. \"Doctors are neither vague nor careless,\" he said. The solution is to defer the diagnosis until more detailed information can be got. There are 5,000 to 6,000 cases of measles registered each year in the United Kingdom, but these findings now call most of them into doubt.\"\nGeez, ever wonder if that might be happening at Disneyland, and beyond...and for multiple diseases against which we vaccinate, including the \"flu\"?\n3.\u00c2\u00a0 Why isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the media reporting on the ineffectiveness and the dangers of the MMR vaccine, as exposed and evidenced by recent whistleblowers...2 from Merck, and 1 from the CDC? Again, one must ask why America's mainstream media have refused to report on these whistleblowers (can you say cha-ching from those non-stop pharma ads on TV and in the propaganda-papers), especially given the gravity of the vaccine research fraud they have exposed, and what that fraud means for parents making vaccine decisions, not to mention what it means for the vulnerable and innocent children receiving the vaccines.\n4.\u00c2\u00a0 Why have parents been denied choice with regards to being allowed to choose monovalent vaccines over the trivalent MMR vaccine?\u00c2\u00a0 Ever since Dr. Andrew Wakefield dared to do the unthinkable...i.e. question a vaccine (gasp! like big pharma would ever sell a product that might cause problems, or death...gasp again!), in this case, the MMR vaccine...government officials and committee members decided they did not like the people questioning vaccines, so they colluded with Merck and other profiteers to stop the production of the monovalent measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines, forcing consumers to use the trivalent MMR vaccine (a 3-in-1 vaccine, which has the potential to be far more dangerous than individual vaccines given separately and at different times).\n*See footnote at the bottom to see Merck's \"explanation\" of why they discontinued the monovalent M, M, and R vaccines.\u00c2\u00a0 Then, look up who comprises the ACIP (see anyone who might possibly have a conflict of interest, say someone who might just profit from the approval and sale of vaccines?).\u00c2\u00a0 Ask yourself who the \"professional societies\" might be, and if they by chance might just happen to greatly profit from vaccines and their numerous after-effects.\u00c2\u00a0 And those \"scientific leaders\", might they be scientists who work at or for Merck, or have a chair endowed for them by Merck? Last mentioned are customers.\u00c2\u00a0 Guess those customers who want to have a choice, and who want the 3 monovalent vaccines, don't matter much to Merck.\n5.\u00c2\u00a0 Clearly, the MMR is not the highly effective vaccine it is touted to be, as evidenced by so many vaccinated individuals reportedly contracting the measles (and mumps, for that matter).\u00c2\u00a0 Nor is the MMR vaccine the highly safe vaccine it is touted to be, as evidenced by reports to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System.\u00c2\u00a0 Many more people in the U.S. have died from this vaccine (and from the MMR-Varicella quadrivalent vaccine) than from the measles in the past 2 decades, and parents need to factor that fact into their decision whether or not to vaccinate their children.\u00c2\u00a0\n6.\u00c2\u00a0 If babies under age 12-15 months are contracting actual measles, one must ask 2 questions:\u00c2\u00a0 a.) Is the mom exclusively breastfeeding so that maternal immunity is being passed on to her baby?\u00c2\u00a0 If not, the baby misses out on important protection gained from its mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immunity, and may be more susceptible to illness. (I realize that not every mother is able to breastfeed. I have helped a mother who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t produce enough breastmilk to connect with other nursing mothers who were willing to share their surplus, which is something moms in this situation might want to consider).\u00c2\u00a0 If the baby was unable to nurse properly from the get-go, look no further than the effects of the birth dose of the Hep B vaccine, which has been shown to negatively affect innate infant reflexes needed to locate a mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breast and latch on to it.\u00c2\u00a0 b.)\u00c2\u00a0 If the mom was vaccinated with the MMR herself at any point, her ability to acquire and pass on natural, protective immunity to her infant via breastfeeding has been impaired, possibly ruined\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6meaning the vaccine is to blame, not the unvaccinated.\n7.\u00c2\u00a0 If parents are taking their very young children to dirty, unsanitary places with thousands and thousands of people, they have made the choice to expose their children to multitudinous germs and illnesses from multitudinous people, leaving them in no position to finger point at others.\u00c2\u00a0 It can, and should, be argued that to the maximum extent possible, infants should be kept at home for the first few months of life and away from extremely crowded places for perhaps their first couple of years, giving their immune systems time to develop and mature.\u00c2\u00a0\n8.\u00c2\u00a0 If vaccines work, the vaccinated should be protected.\u00c2\u00a0 If they don't work, ask yourself why are you allowing them and exposing your child to such incredible risks?\u00c2\u00a0 Furthermore, if they don't work, as is often the case, feel free to have your child vaccinated again and again (no one is stopping you), but don't expect others to vaccinate their children with scores of products that have long track records of not working and of wreaking havoc.\n9.\u00c2\u00a0 It was not ever, is not today, and will not be tomorrow my child's job to protect your child, in any way, shape, or form.\u00c2\u00a0 That is the parent's job.\u00c2\u00a0 Period.\u00c2\u00a0 Ask yourself who exactly is making these decisions as to which child is more worthy of living, since death and disability are possible consequences of both the disease and the vaccine.\u00c2\u00a0 Since there is a decision to be made, it should reside with the parent, or with the vaccine recipient, not with anyone else, and most certainly not with the ones profiting from vaccines, be it directly (pharmaceutical companies, doctors, and hospitals) or indirectly (elected officials, government regulators, and trade industry groups, all of whom enjoy plenty of big pharma dollars and perks).\n10.\u00c2\u00a0 There is no longer any excuse, nor is it acceptable, for any parent, doctor, media person, elected official, or government regulator to state the false claims that vaccines are safe and effective. \u00c2\u00a0They are neither, and not even one has ever been proven to be such.\u00c2\u00a0 As a matter of fact, \"highly secret documents\" from pharmaceutical companies, in addition to pharmaceutical company and CDC whistleblowers, continue to reveal and expose on a regular basis that vaccines are neither safe nor effective, and never have been.\u00c2\u00a0\nAdditionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has officially and legally declared vaccines to be \"unavoidably unsafe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\u00c2\u00a0 For those who find that a hard-to-decipher double negative, that means that vaccines are inherently dangerous, yet, they are mandated for children.\u00c2\u00a0 As a colleague of mine recently commented, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a choice about unavoidably unsafe products, what the hell choices do you have that are meaningful?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIt is also imperative to remember that in 1986, the U.S. Congress was foolish enough to cave in to a bunch of whining vaccine-making pharmaceutical companies who said they weren't going to make vaccines anymore because they were losing so many costly lawsuits due to their vaccines killing and maiming people.\u00c2\u00a0 This whining, no doubt paired with lobbying, resulted in Congress indemnifying vaccine-making pharmaceutical companies, and those who administer vaccines, from liability for injuries and deaths caused by vaccines.\u00c2\u00a0 Yes, you heard that correctly.\u00c2\u00a0 Not Liable.\u00c2\u00a0 With that Act of Congress, any incentive or means of accountability to make a safe vaccine product flew right out the window.\nIt is critical for any person who is considering vaccination for themselves, their children, or those in their care, such as elderly parents, to take the time to educate himself\/herself regarding vaccine history, vaccine ingredients, vaccine adverse events, vaccine trials, vaccine research fraud, vaccine injuries, and vaccine deaths.\u00c2\u00a0 Vaccination is a risky medical procedure, and as such, it should not be entered into lightly or without due diligence.\n11.\u00c2\u00a0 Vaccine mandates for children are extremely age discriminatory, and parents should begin to sue over this fact. Notice that those doing the mandating aren't rolling up their sleeves and pant legs, and dropping their drawers, for 70+ dastardly vaccine cocktails.\u00c2\u00a0 Rather, they sit back and order that infants, toddlers, and young children be shot up to hell and back, stripping parents of their rights and freedoms, just so long as those pharmaceutical companies keep filling their campaign coffers and providing perks.\n12.\u00c2\u00a0 It is time to stop delegating your health care decisions to your pediatrician and instead become your own expert.\u00c2\u00a0 Your child is counting on you.\u00c2\u00a0 Your child's pediatrician is not the vaccine expert you think he\/she is.\u00c2\u00a0 Their \"vaccine training\" in medical school, reported to be as brief as 2 hours, revolved around learning how and where to give a tiny baby up to 12 vaccines at one time from 8 syringes.\u00c2\u00a0 Once you allow the toxic cocktails of heinous vaccine materials to enter your child's body, you can't retrieve them.\u00c2\u00a0 They have now entered a closed system, a system which includes your child's brain, nerves, and blood, during critical developmental periods. Think about that.\u00c2\u00a0 Think hard.\u00c2\u00a0 There is no do-over.\u00c2\u00a0 Trust me, I speak from experience about the no do-over part.\n13.\u00c2\u00a0 Glimpse of our future, which has actually already arrived.\u00c2\u00a0 Have you thought about who is going to be able to defend our country now that we have children being environmentally injured to the extent of 1 in 6 having a neurodevelopmental disorder (that's code name for brain damage), 1 in 11 having asthma, 1 in 12 having food allergies (some of which are life-threatening, and all of which are life-altering), 1 in 50 having Autism, 1 in 400 having Type 1 Diabetes, many having GI and colon problems, seizure disorders, etc.?\u00c2\u00a0\nHere's how it's going to look when the alarm sounds and our health- and development-impaired young Americans are called to battle:\u00c2\u00a0 \"Wait!\u00c2\u00a0 I need to grab my EpiPen!\"\u00c2\u00a0 \"Well, I need my inhaler.\"\u00c2\u00a0 \"I need gluten-free, casein-free, soy-free to-go meals!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0 \"I can't find my prescription meds!\"\u00c2\u00a0 \"NO ONE can bring peanuts, or any tree nuts for that matter, on this mission!\"\u00c2\u00a0 \"Oh no! My insulin pod just fell off, and I don't have a new one to put on!\"\u00c2\u00a0 \"I'm having chronic diarrhea, so I can't come along today!\"\u00c2\u00a0 \"Well, I haven't pooped for a month and my stomach is killing me, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go either!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0 \"I can't follow more than 2 instructions at once, so I'm already confused and we haven't even left yet.\"\u00c2\u00a0 And then there are the ones who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk at all, aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t toilet-trained, and who have the skill level of a toddler\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be eligible to serve in any, way, shape, or form.\u00c2\u00a0 Apparently, the military is already experiencing this, and has written a report titled Ready, Willing, and Unable to Serve.\u00c2\u00a0 This is our future, folks.\nTragically, these same issues have affected our kids' back-to-school-supplies. Instead of scissors, crayons, and pencils, it's EpiPens, inhalers, insulin, prescription meds, special foods, and lengthy IEPs.\n14.\u00c2\u00a0 If you still are not getting the picture, then please hotfoot it over to your nearest elementary, junior high, or high school and ask to see the special education classrooms (that's right, plural, classrooms). \u00c2\u00a0Notice how many kids are in each one.\u00c2\u00a0 Notice how oddly behaved they are.\u00c2\u00a0 This is our new normal.\u00c2\u00a0 Vaccinate your child, and you'll stand a good chance of experiencing firsthand what I'm talking about.\n15.\u00c2\u00a0 A warning, one I wish had been issued to me back in 1992:\u00c2\u00a0 Beware of those \"well-baby\" appointments.\u00c2\u00a0 Your baby may never be well again if you allow him\/her to be vaccinated.\nPlease don't be led like a lamb to the slaughter with your baby in hand, and a fistful of syringes in the nurse's hand...syringes destined for your tiny baby's developing body, ready to destroy its immune system, nervous system, neurological development, and health, all in one fell swoop.\u00c2\u00a0 Those syringes might even take your child's life.\u00c2\u00a0\nDon't be manipulated.\u00c2\u00a0 Be responsible for making your own well-researched decisions.\nLaura Hayes\nMother of Vaccine Injured Children\nPassionate about educating others and encouraging them to learn about the myriad dangers and inefficacies of vaccines, the fallacy of the theory behind them, and the vast web of fraud and deception involved in supporting and mandating them\n*Footnote, on Merck letterhead:\nOctober 21, 2009\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nDear Health Care Provider:\nMonovalent vaccines no longer available for measles, mumps, rubella\nBased on input from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), professional societies, scientific leaders, and customers, Merck has decided not to resume production of ATTENUVAX\u00c2\u00ae (Measles Virus Vaccine Live), MUMPSVAX\u00c2\u00ae (Mumps Virus Vaccine Live), and MERUVAX\u00c2\u00aeII (Rubella Virus Vaccine Live). This science-based decision will support vaccination of the largest group of appropriate individuals.\nIf some of those people in Disney were baby boomers than they would not have had any MMR or single measles shot. Factor in people who hadn't had a shot since the LMV of 1967, people from other countries that don't require all of the shots that the US does, that would be between 25-28 other countries and since Disney is the number 1 tourist destination on the planet you can imagine all the people from different countries merging on that one location who haven't had the MMR either because it wasn't required or they were exempt.  Also, since Dr. William Thompson's confession about the MMR study being manipulated school immunization rates were down last fall (according to the many pants on fire news outlets) so there were most likely a lot of kids from the US who didn't have that booster shot last fall and I can't see all the parents getting those adult boosters. I would say the number of children who are vaccinated have nothing to do with the fact that tens of thousands didn't get measles.  The measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed.  Disney is huge and their sanitation standards used to be pretty high. I know the last time my family was there the staff was constantly cleaning, sweeping, wiping down door knobs, rails, table, benches etc. \nThank you Eindeker. 4 fully MMR vaccinated cases out of 52 represents a current vaccine failure rate of 7.6%. This is disgraceful, considering parents were and are promised a near 100% immunisation status after administration of 2 MMR vaccine doses. I note another 2 cases were known to have received one measles vaccine dose.\nOf the other measles cases, (quote) \"28 (55%) were unvaccinated, 17 (31%) had unknown vaccination status, and 6 (12%) were vaccinated. Of the 6 cases vaccinated, 2 had received 1 dose and 4 had received 2 or more doses. Among the 28 unvaccinated cases, 5 were under age for vaccination.\"\nThe 17 cases with unknown vaccination status, (i.e. no documentation), might well have been vaccinated in infancy or later. It is wrong to assume they are unvaccinated, just because the 'paperwork' is missing. \nThe 5 cases too young to be vaccinated, were babies younger than one year old, and no blame attaches to their parents for their babies' becoming infected. It's a pity vaccination has now destroyed the maternal placental\/ breast feeding conferred immunisation, which previously protected babies for their first year of life.\nIt's no use blaming 'unvaccinated' persons for vaccine failures. If you remove the babies from the 28, stated unvaccinated cases, then we are left with 23, less than half of confirmed cases, and there might well be good reasons for them being unvaccinated, i.e. immune compromised etc. Some will have chosen not to vaccinate, preferring a transient disease conferring lifelong immunity, to the dangers of vaccinations.\nIn particular, it seems the vaccine is particularly ineffective against measles genotype B3. (quote) \"During the last 6 months, identical genotype B3 viruses were also detected in at least 14 countries and at least 6 U.S. states, not including those linked to the current outbreak.\"\nOne of the tragedies of vaccines and service members is how disproportionately the families of armed service members are affected by vaccine mandates. Service members lose their right to be exempt from vaccines the moment they sign up, and their subsequent families pay the price twice-over. The soldiers are first affected by the initial onslaught of shots, and children born afterwards are documented by our own DOD to be TWICE AS LIKELY as their civilian counterparts to be autistic. Worse yet, children of military families who are on military insurance plans receive significantly less funding for therapeutic services than their civilian counterparts. There are a mind-blowing number of families with 3 or more generations of distinguished military service, where there are now no more children in the family physically capable of continuing service to our country. This is absolutely criminal.\nI loved the article.  I laughed out loud at paragraphs 11 and 13. Would like to add Dr. Tetyana Obukhanych Talk at Aligned Chiropractic in Kelowna B.C. March 2013 youtube video to the conversation.  A Stanford-trained immunologist, she realized when she immigrated that she had been vaccinated twice for measles, yet had had measles when she was eleven. That started her questioning what she was being taught (i.e., thinking for herself).  I think her video is good at explaining why vaccination does not always provide any immunity and giving parents more information in weighing the pros and cons.  \nAlso, from what I have read, adding chicken pox vaccine to the MMR doubles the risk of febrile seizure, or adds one febrile seizure per 1000.  Many may not know that. The risk is lessened even when both MMR and chickenpox vaccine are given on the same day but at different injection sites.  Why would this be when the varicella vaccine alone is usually not harmful? There seem to be a lot of things we do not know yet about how live viruses interact, as Dr. Wakefield suggested.  \nDr Iannelli - You can't blame folks for being confused, regarding the high number of circulating measles strains. It was you after all, who pointed out the prevalence of the B3 measles genotype in the Disney cases. For the record, the measles vaccine uses A genotype strains, and yes the vaccine 'works', since measles cases have become rare since the vaccine's introduction during the 1960s. \nThe concerns expressed here are not about whether or not the measles vaccine 'works', but the overall efficacy of the vaccine. The Disney cases have revealed an alarming proportion of vaccinated persons amongst those infected measles cases. This is surely a matter for public concern, since parents were initially promised lifelong immunity from measles after only ONE vaccine dose. The boosters were introduced to 'mop up' the 5% or so admitted cases where the initial vaccinations failed to 'take'. \nThe Disney cases are just one example of measles outbreaks occurring in highly vaccinated populations. There have been outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations all over the world. It's time to stop blaming Dr Wakefield, for measles outbreaks happening more than 15 years after the publication of the Wakefield et al Lancet paper, which only caused a temporary dip in vaccinations, which soon recovered to previous vaccination levels of >90%. \nYes there IS a conspiracy - an official conspiracy of misinformation and silence about the REAL causes of these measles outbreaks. The WHO monitores measles outbreaks worldwide and the spread of individual measles genotypes. So why were we NOT told in the UK about those 10 persons from the Philippines who arrived on our shores infected with B3 measles, and presumably caused at least some of the much hyped measles outbreaks. What did this have to do with Dr Wakefield? - a doctor who always strongly advocated measles vaccinations, albeit with single measles vaccines.\nIf the MMR measles vaccine component is failing, like the mumps component, to protect against these diseases long term, then a complete re-think  about measles immunisation is necessary and long overdue. It won't 'do' to tell people to get an MMR jab every time they visit a theme park. People are not stupid, and these recent measles outbreaks, in Disney, Wales, Japan and elsewhere, are revealing what my generation has always known. The vast majority of healthy children soon recover from measles, with lifelong immunity.   \nDr Iannelli Vincent pointed out that the measles viral strain is genotype B3 virus. Researching the link that Jenny Allen provided to the WHO, genotype B3 measles cases appears to be the circulating strain in travellers returning from the Philippines since late 2013, including Australia, Canada, Italy, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  BTW, the title page on the WHO webpage is: \n Ongoing increase in measles cases following importations, Japan, March 2014: times of challenge and opportunity.  \nYes the opportunity to terrorize more people into getting this jab and the pharmaceutical companies, which I'm sure members of WHO have substantial stock in, more profits. \nI went to the CDC's webpage on Measles and these are the 19 genotypes detected since 1990:\nB3 is in this series so I imagine that since they have been able to type the genotypes all of them may be in circulation, theoretically of course.  \nHere are the Vaccine Strains:\n *Vaccine strains Moraten, Edmonston, Zagreb are all genotype A.\n There were 2 putative wild-type cases of measles identified as genotype A in 2008.\n -During 2011, 8 genotypes were identified by global surveillance:\n\"A\" strains are in the MMR that they have been pushing since who know when but at least since 1990 it's been know by the WHO & CDC that other strains were more than likely circulating.  It's been know since 2013 that the strain was B3.  If B3 is the strain circulating why is the WHO & CDC pushing a genotype A strain vaccine onto people?\nI look at like this:  If you want to create a global pandemic than what you do is give people the wrong vaccine knowing it would not stop the circulation of the illness and most likely will mutate into another form which will enhance the urgency of:\n 1.convincing more people to take the jab which will increase profits and add to the continuing decline of the public health overall but increase the financial bottom line of the profiteers. \n 2.convince the populace that more government control over the health care choices of it's citizens should be left in the hands of government officials who would make all vaccines mandatory.\n 3.convince the uninformed that \"unvaccinated\" people are a threat to the public health which would continue to polarize the Vaccinated against the UnVaccinated.  This is a divide and conquer tactic because the media is in the back pocket of the government and big pharma so opposing information is suppressed. The Vaccinated would become the champions for the government, CDC, and the pharmaceutical industry- as they have become over the last 5 years.  Boon for the poison makers-these people are doing it for free. \n 4.it will give big pharma a firmer foundation to ask for more government money to research a \"definitive or universal measles vaccine\" under the guise of maintaing the public as well as the global health. \n 5.it will open the doors for big pharma to acquire more state & US congresspeople and senators onto their payrolls. OOPS- I mean give more campaign donations and possibly the opportunity to become a pharma lobbyist once they leave their government job. (think of Eric Cantor on Wall Street now.  He has been well rewarded for his services.  Another that comes to mind-Julie Gerberding)  What government official wouldn't want to be seen as a hero to their constitutes as one of the people that supported the eradication of a terrible horrifying killing childhood illness such as measles.\nWhat we are witnessing is Henry Kissingers plan in action.\nDr. Gregory Poland stated in his two papers in 1994 & 2102 that the present and apparently past vaccines for measles doesn't work.  (It never worked and there is no scientific data to confirm that it did). Poland is Professor of Medicine and founder and leader of Mayo Clinic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vaccine Research Group\n 1994: Arch Intern Med. 1994 Aug 22;154(16):1815-20.\n Failure to reach the goal of measles elimination. Apparent paradox of measles infections in immunized persons.  Conclusion: The apparent paradox is that as measles immunization rates rise to high levels in a population, measles becomes a disease of immunized persons. Because of the failure rate of the vaccine and the unique transmissibility of the measles virus, the currently available measles vaccine, used in a single-dose strategy, is unlikely to completely eliminate measles. The long-term success of a two-dose strategy to eliminate measles remains to be determined. \n 2012:Poland- \"The measles vaccine has failed\", he explained two years ago in a prescient paper, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The re-emergence of measles in developed countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In that paper, he warned that due to factors that most haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t noticed, measles has come back to be a serious public health threat. Poland sees the need for a major rethink, after concluding that the current measles vaccine is unlikely to ever live up to the job expected of it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outbreaks are occurring even in highly developed countries where vaccine access, public health infrastructure, and health literacy are not significant issues. This is unexpected and a worrisome harbinger \u00e2\u20ac\u201d measles outbreaks are occurring where they are least expected,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote in his 2012 paper, listing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153surprising numbers of cases occurring in persons who previously received one or even two documented doses of measles-containing vaccine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd During the 1989-1991 U.S. outbreaks, 20% to 40% of those affected had received one to two doses. In a 2011 outbreak in Canada, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153over 50% of the 98 individuals had received two doses of measles vaccine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\"he warned that due to factors that most haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t noticed, measles has come back to be a serious public health threat\"\n -First, I don't believe that measles is a serious health threat. I think if you're a researcher and you're firmly in the pro-vaccine camp and you want to stay on their good side, you continue the \"con\" in your paper by stating that childhood illness are a health threat.  Dr. William Thompson stated that he fully support vaccines BUT this is the fraud that the CDC committed stating that the vaccines cause damages. It's the basic CYA.\nWhen Poland wrote: \"he warned that due to factors that most haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t noticed\", he never stated what those factors are.  Why?  Might it be he knew prior to 1994 that the circulating strain of measles was not what was in the vaccines being given around the world? If's he's the best of the best as I have read I'm sure he knew. It's pointless to mull over why he remains silent but guilt has a way of seeping out and I think Poland has been saying it without saying it. \n\"A\" strain vaccine-B3 strain circulating virus.  No wonder there have been outbreaks of measles in highly vaccinated populations. It does work.  Just not for the populace.  \nDon't forget:\n Merck is sued by former virologist employees for deliberately falsifying mumps vaccine efficacy studies.\nJudge: Lawsuit Against Merck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MMR Vaccine Fraud to Continue\n Merck is the only manufacturer licensed by the FDA to sell the mumps vaccine in United States, and if it could not show that the vaccine was 95 percent effective, it risked losing its lucrative monopoly, according to the complaint.  (court document at webpage)\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Merck found it critically important to keep claiming such a high efficacy rate, the complaint states.\nUnder Protocol 007, Merck did not test the vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to protect children against a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wild-type\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mumps virus, which is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the type of real-life virus against which vaccines are generally tested,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the complaint states.\nInstead, Chatom says, Merck tested children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blood using its own attenuated strain of the virus.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was the same mumps strain with which the children were vaccinated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the complaint states.\nThat \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subverted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the purpose of the testing regime, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153which was to measure the vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to provide protection against a disease-causing mumps virus that a child would actually face in real life. The end result of this deviation \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 was that Merck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s test overstated the vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effectiveness,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chatom claims.\nMerck also added animal antibodies to blood samples to achieve more favorable test results, though it knew that the human immune system would never produce such antibodies, and that the antibodies created a laboratory testing scenario that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not in any way correspond to, correlate with, or represent real life \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 virus neutralization in vaccinated people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to the complaint.\nYou have a 3 part injection that suppose to work in \"harmony\" with each other.  Measles strain is not working says one scientist.  Mumps strain not working says other scientist.  2 part out of 3 don't work.  This is like putting a 1930 carburetor into a 2015 car.\nCia says :- \"Gareth may have had atypical measles, possibly because he HAD been vaxed, which often presents with no rash and is a lot more serious than normal measles.\"\nYes possibly Cia, but to be blunt I simply don't believe a single word put out by the Welsh Health Authorities about those Jan-May 2013 Welsh measles cases, including those statements about Mr Colfor-Williams' medical case. They were quite DESPERATE for a measles death, having spent months spreading doom and gloom about measles, including certain death predictions, and ridiculously overhyped false measles statistics.\nSome healthy looking Welsh children were interviewed on TV saying how terrible their measles experiences were, but statistically less than a fifth of those notified measles cases were actually lab confirmed, and I'm suspicious about those too. If these children DID have measles they will be immune for life, and the girls will be able to protect their future babies during their first year of life with placental\/ breast milk conferred measles immunity. I found it significant, but utterly reckless on the part of the Welsh Government, to recommend MMR vaccinations for ALL babies over 6 months old (contraindicated on vaccine inserts), the babies were STILL to get another MMR vaccination at the normal 12-18 months period. Those so called 'measles victims' were advised to get MMR vaccinations too.\nGareth had been in hospital for a week, being treated for severe asthma, before being discharged. A week or so later he was so seriously ill, his worried Mum, took him to the local NHS primary care doctors (GPs), begging for him to be readmitted to hospital. His Mum says then there was no rash, and the doctors just sent him home and advised Paracetamol to ease his symptoms. He died shortly afterwards, from respiratory failure caused by overwhelming pneumonia. The GPs apparently failed to notice this, or how ill this young man was at the time. I think most people would regard this as medical negligence. If Gareth had been admitted to an intensive care unit at his local hospital, he might have survived.\nLater Gareth was stated to have had measles, by the Welsh Authorities, who have manipulated this death as a measles death in official statistics. (The Coroner recorded, the measles MIGHT have caused the pneumonia, but the severe asthma and Gareth's weakened immune compromised state were just as likely causes). The Coroner did not ask for a lab measles confirmation at the Inquest, but took the Health Authorities word as gospel. Maybe he shouldn't have.\nIf -and for me still an IF- Gareth had measles at the time of his death, then the time scale strongly indicates he was infected during his week in hospital being treated for asthma. Again we were told in the press and media, other 'measles' cases had been 'hospitalised'. I would like to know what steps were taken to protect other patients from cross infection in the hospital, particularly extremely vulnerable patients like Gareth.\nOf course, we will never get answers to any of these questions, but I sincerely hope and pray Gareth's family members have been properly compensated by the NHS for the deficiencies in his medical care. I also felt Gareth and his family members were 'smeared' by a very nasty Press and Media at the time. Remember, Gareth's Mum stated she had him vaccinated against measles when he was a child. I would believe her word over those Welsh spokespersons any day!\nJohnQPublic :they do it because an immunized child is healthier, and costs them less money per year than a non-immunized one.\n 1976: 1 child in 30 was learning disabled \n1980: 1 child in 27 had asthma \n \u00e2\u2020\u20192013: 1 child in 9 has asthma. \n1990\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: 1 child in 555 developed autism \n \u00e2\u2020\u20192013: 1 child in 50 develops autism. \n2001: 1 child in 500 had diabetes \n 1953: CDC recommended 16 doses of 4 vaccines (smallpox, DPT) between two months and age six. \n 1983: CDC recommended 23 doses of 7 vaccines (DPT, MMR, polio) between two months and age six. \nOver 50% of children have a chronic condition and 1 in 6 have a neurodevelomental disorder (aka vaccine caused brain injury). Autism and autoimmune disorders are skyrocketing. Injecting aluminum, mercury, aborted fetal tissue, formaldehyde, MSG, diseased monkey kidney, etc. does not bring health.\nABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To fill gaps in crucial data needed for health and educational planning, we determined the prevalence of developmental disabilities in US children and in selected populations for a recent 12-year period.\nPARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We used data on children aged 3 to 17 years from the 1997\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2008 National Health Interview Surveys, which are ongoing nationally representative samples of US households. Parent-reported diagnoses of the following were included: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; intellectual disability; cerebral palsy; autism; seizures; stuttering or stammering; moderate to profound hearing loss; blindness; learning disorders; and\/or other developmental delays.\nRESULTS: Boys had a higher prevalence overall and for a number of select disabilities compared with girls. Hispanic children had the lowest prevalence for a number of disabilities compared with non-Hispanic white and black children. Low income and public health insurance were associated with a higher prevalence of many disabilities. Prevalence of any developmental disability increased from 12.84% to 15.04% over 12 years. Autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other developmental delays increased, whereas hearing loss showed a significant decline. These trends were found in all of the sociodemographic subgroups, except for autism in non-Hispanic black children.\nCONCLUSIONS: Developmental disabilities are common and were reported in \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc1 in 6 children in the United States in 2006\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2008. The number of children with select developmental disabilities (autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other developmental delays) has increased, requiring more health and education services. Additional study of the influence of risk-factor shifts, changes in acceptance, and benefits of early services is needed.\n-Unfortunately, there are not very many studies in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s literature that compare the health of vaccinated and unvaccinated children. However, the few do indicate that unvaccinated children suffer far less in today's \"normal\" diseases such as eczema, asthma, ADHD, etc., as vaccinated children. Within the existing studies one must also consider that parents, who do not vaccinate their children, often use alternative therapies such as homeopathy.\nA German study released in September 2011 of about 8000 UNVACCINATED children, newborn to 19 years, show vaccinated children have at least 2 to 5 times more diseases and disorders than unvaccinated children.\n \"During the most recent 12-month period (January 2013 to December 2013) the 30 EU\/EEA countries conducting measles surveillance reported 10 271 cases. Twenty-five of the 30 contributing countries reported consistently for the 12-month period. Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania and the United Kingdom accounted for 91% of the cases in this period.\"\nMy comment -OK we are now down to 6162 so called confirmed measles cases, Europe wide.\nEindeker- Pre measles vaccine 'historical' measles notifications and deaths are at best mainly estimates, and most of these cases will not have been lab confirmed, including the 'deaths' which will not have been from measles, but complications assumed to have arisen from it. I lived through the 40s and 50s and remember virtually EVERY child contracting measles then. Parents were far more concerned about diptheria, polio and TB, and were relieved to have us vaccinated. Scarlet fever, was also rife, but newly introduced antibiotics, penicillin and streptomycin, dealt with that. I don't remember any measles disabilities or deaths amongst the hundreds of children in my schools.\nThere's no question measles vaccinations, introduced into the UK in 1968, have kept down the numbers of measles infections. The link you provided is for NOTIFIED measles cases in England and Wales. These numbers are far higher than lab confirmed cases.   \nThe two UK measles deaths post MMR vaccine (1988) were children who could not be vaccinated due to immune deficiencies caused by very serious co morbidities. Measles does not kill healthy children, although this disease requires careful nursing. Dr Wakefield was very unfairly accused of 'murdering' these two children, by putting parents off the MMR vaccine, (remember that CNN Anderson Cooper interview?) One child was 13 years old when he died in 2006. His first MMR vaccination would have been due around 1994-5, at 12-15 months old, a booster around 3 years later, pre-dating the 1998 Wakefield et al paper. These children were unlikely to have caught measles from other children, since single measles vaccine was already part of the UK child immunisation schedule prior to MMR vaccine intro 1988. The extract below makes it clear the reason for non vaccinations in both cases was immune deficiencies. Dr Wakefield has ALWAYS advocated vaccinating against measles, but suggested a return to single vaccines pending more MMR vaccine safety studies:- \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Another lesson learned is that, if large measles outbreaks are occurring anywhere in the world, the viruses are soon detected almost everywhere. Measles transmission can occur anywhere, and molecular techniques are often the only method for identifying the source of an outbreak or isolated case when standard case reporting fails to identify a source. Exposures can occur in airports or other areas frequented by international travelers, such as amusement parks, conferences, and sporting events. In 2005, sequence information was used to link cases that occurred in the Netherlands to an exposure in an airport in the United States [25], whereas in 2007, sequence data were used to link cases that occurred in Texas and Michigan to an imported case at an international youth sporting event in Pennsylvania [26, 27].\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe excellent comments below were sent to me in response to my article today.  I have asked the author for permission to post them here on AoA, and permission has been granted. This person is an advocate who has worked with hundreds of families who have children with disabilities to help them make their own choices for treatment with ABA and other necessary medical treatments.  Here are the person's comments:\n The question for parents to answer must be with the risks in either direction of outcome taken as a certainty to be sure that the consequences are tolerable.  It is gambling, so the player must be able to tolerate the loss of the entire bounty used for a wager even if odds seem good.\nA 1 in 2500 chance just for a seizure from MMR, or seizure that develops into a chronic disorder, is one child in a packed high school gymnasium for a school rally.  Which one will it be and how will we choose who?  Does it matter that the number may change to 1 in 2000 or 1 in 500?  What is the correct number of intended consequences of the decision to vaccinate every student?  Vaccine injury is an intended, unavoidable consequence of a mass vaccination program.\nNo one can routinely identify what measles is, yet the mainstream insist on mass vaccination for it as a belief system that is impervious to intellectual analysis of risk versus reward using data.  Everyone should know exactly what each disease is prior to making a decision about how to prevent it with a potentially toxic or deadly medication.\nIf new parents don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that children under two have immature immune systems that may not be resilient enough to withstand common infections, then please begin the education campaign to teach about disease prevention and personal responsibility.  Going with a baby to Disneyland and the airports to travel to Disneyland, which are international petri dishes, is a protected civil right, but so is the responsibility to make the decision about the risks in doing so.\nAnd the big message for all healthcare providers and government agencies is GIVE US THE UNADULTERATED TRUTH so we can make our own decisions whatever they may be.  Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lie to us and patronize us like small children who should not hear the details of how the sausage is made. \nAny doctor who tells an individual patient that all vaccines are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safe and effective\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is lazily parroting the CDC, being coerced by health employer quotas and peer pressure, or is a believer of a philosophical construct of any means to reach an end, as the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own data on public databases clearly states that vaccines are neither safe nor effective when the commonly understood definitions are applied.  \nThe end state by all roads is that parents must gamble, use healthy lifestyle practices, and then hope that it all works out.  That is the best that any of us can do.\n Are you kidding? All the VACCINATED people are spreading not only measles but any other live virus illness including the flu right now. That's the problem.  Also, people, specifically children are contracting the illness from the vaccination they have been given. It's interesting what family members in the medical community that work in clinic will tell you. My nieces tell me when pediatricians see kids with the exact same symptoms, labs and history, they would diagnose the un-vaccinated kids with the apparent disease, e.g. \"measles,\" but the vaccinated would be diagnosed as \"viral syndrome, NOS.\"  This was on the basis that they assumed the vaccinated kids could NOT possibly have the disease! I'm told this is standard practice. So the percentage of vaccinated children who get the diseases may in fact be much higher than what we are told. \n Here are examples of measles outbreaks in fully vaccinated populations:\n -NY Measles outbreak: 26 cases total. 14 adults and 12 children. Patient Zero is a 22 year old VACCINATED young lady who contracted measles in 2011.  Vaccination status of the adults all vaccinated  with at least i shot. The children, 4 were too young to get the MMR, 6 were vaccinated and 2 unvaccinated. Statically that means at least 90% were vaccinated. \n -PLoS study: \"Difficulties in eliminating measles and controlling rubella and mumps: a cross-sectional study of a first measles and rubella vaccination and a second measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination,\" has brought to light the glaring ineffectiveness of two measles vaccines (measles\u00e2\u20ac\u201crubella (MR) or measles\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmumps\u00e2\u20ac\u201crubella (MMR) ) in fulfilling their widely claimed promise of preventing outbreaks in highly vaccine compliant populations.\nChina has one of the most vaccination compliant populations in the world. In fact, measles vaccine is mandatory. So why have they had over 700 measles outbreaks from 2009 and 2012 alone? \"The reported coverage of the measles-rubella (MR) or measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is greater than 99.0% in Zhejiang province.

We report here the case of a child presenting with fever 8 days after vaccination with a measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Measles virus was isolated in a throat swab taken 4 days after fever onset. This virus was then further genetically characterised as a vaccine-type virus. Fever occurring subsequent to measles vaccination is related to the replication of the live attenuated vaccine virus. In the case presented here, the vaccine virus was isolated in the throat, showing that subcutaneous injection of an attenuated measles strain can result in respiratory excretion of this virus.

I would go beyond the premise that it is probably an instance of the vaccinated spreading vaccine-strain measles virus to all and sundry. That might be the case, but I think it's more probable that it's going to turn out to be natural measles infecting all these people. Maybe it's mutated a little so that the vaccine no longer protects against it. While everything you said about live virus vaccines being possibly contagious is true, I think it is more important not to even worry about the vaccine's role, and instead ask people to look at the outcomes and decide whether it is even worth getting a dangerous vaccine to attempt to protect against such a mild disease. Apparently the outbreak at Disneyland started in December, so that's been plenty of time to do the body count of the myriad people killed or permanently damaged by getting natural measles. What? None? Are you sure? Are the media just not doing their job, and they're somehow letting the dozens of deaths or cases of encephalitis go unreported? I don't think so. I think the REALLY important thing here is to tell people to watch. One person after another sick with a high fever for several days and then? Well, gosh darn it, they get well and go back to work or school, how are we going to spin that to keep people in the vaccine lines? \nThe WHO declared Measles eradicated in the year 2000 from what I've read but I can't find an information on what the criteria was to declare the eradication.  One comment I read stated the criteria was in the year 2000 there were no measles cased around the world so the WHO declared them gone. If this is so why hasn't any reporter researched the CDC's National Vital Statics Report which shows there were 86 cases? Since this is the CDC I am assuming lab confirmed in 2000. I know for Polio the diagnostic criteria was changed which is why TPTB are not calling EV-D68 what is is - Polio so perhaps the same thing happened with measles?  If anyone has any information on the WHO criteria for eradication of a illness or disease please post it.  I'd be very interested to research it further.   \n","6":"A vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\u201dalso called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immunization\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis a substance that teaches your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful viruses or bacteria.\nVaccines given before you get infected are called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153preventive vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prophylactic vaccines,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and you get them while you are healthy. This allows your body to set up defenses against those dangers ahead of time. That way, you won't get sick if you're exposed to them later. Preventive vaccines are widely used to prevent diseases like polio, chicken pox, measles, mumps, rubella, influenza (flu), hepatitis A and B, and human papillomavirus (HPV).\nIn addition to preventive vaccines, there are also therapeutic vaccines. These are vaccines that are designed to treat people after they already have a disease by strengthening the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural immune response against the disease.\nNo. There is currently no vaccine that will prevent HIV infection or treat those who have it.\nHowever, scientists are working to develop one. In 2016, an NIH-supported clinical trial that was launched to test a possible HIV vaccine. This vaccine trial, called HVTN 072, is testing whether an experimental vaccine regimen safely prevents HIV infection among South African adults. Learn more in this video!\nToday, more people living with HIV than ever before have access to life-saving treatment with HIV medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART), which is good for their health and reduces the likelihood that they will transmit the virus to others if they adhere to their HIV medication. In addition, others who are at high risk for HIV infection have access to pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), or ART being used to prevent HIV. Yet, unfortunately, in 2015, 39,513 people were diagnosed with HIV infection in the United States, and more than 2.1 million people became newly infected with HIV worldwide. To control and ultimately end HIV globally, we need a powerful array of HIV prevention tools that are widely accessible to all who would benefit from them.\nVaccines historically have been the most effective means to prevent and even eradicate infectious diseases. They safely and cost-effectively prevent illness, disability, and death. Like smallpox and polio vaccines, a preventive HIV vaccine could help save millions of lives.\nDeveloping safe, effective, and affordable vaccines that can prevent HIV infection in uninfected people is the best hope for controlling and ultimately ending the HIV\/AIDS pandemic.\nThe long-term goal is to develop a safe and effective vaccine that protects people worldwide from getting infected with HIV. However, even if a vaccine only protects some people who get vaccinated, or even if it provides less than total protection, it could still have a major impact on the rates of transmission and help control the pandemic, particularly for populations at high risk of HIV infection. A partially effective vaccine could decrease the number of people who get infected with HIV, further reducing the number of people who can pass the virus on to others.\nA therapeutic vaccine could also benefit people living with HIV by helping slow the progression of the disease and preventing or delaying the onset of AIDS. \u00c2\u00a0\nFor more information, see the video below with Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of NIH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n","7":"Minnesota is experiencing its largest measles outbreak since the 1990s following\u00c2\u00a0a\u00c2\u00a0targeted and intense effort by anti-vaccine groups there to spread the false belief that vaccinations cause autism.\nAs of Thursday, health officials reported 41 confirmed cases, nearly all unvaccinated children from a Somali immigrant community in Hennepin County. The community has for years been a target of anti-vaccine groups, aided by Andrew Wakefield, a fraudulent former physician.\nIn the early 2000s, the large Somali immigrant population had high vaccination rates. But in 2008, fear that their children were suffering from higher rates of autism swept through the community. Though research later concluded that autism rates were not unusually high in the community, anti-vaccination activists pounced on the panic. The activists held community meetings and invited Wakefield to visit with scared families. Vaccination rates dropped from 92 percent in 2004 to 42 percent in 2014.\nWakefield, a former British doctor who now lives in Texas, is considered the founder of the modern anti-vaccination movement. In 2010, around the time he was visiting the Somali community, he was stripped of his British medical license for falsifying a 1998 study.\u00c2\u00a0The study fraudulently alleged that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine caused autism. Wakefield\u00c2\u00a0was paid to produce the study to aid a money-making legal scheme, which ultimately failed. The study was retracted, and Wakefield was also found guilty of dozens of other counts of professional misconduct, including abusing autistic children.\nDespite the shocking misconduct and retraction, the harmful belief that life-saving vaccines cause autism lives on.\nIn a presentation Sunday night to the Somali community, anti-vaccine activist Mark Blaxill played up the threat of autism while glossing over the real risk of measles, The Washington Post reports. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you hear people from the state public health department saying there is no risk, that [vaccines] are safe, this is the sort of thing that should cause you to be skeptical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Blaxill said.\nHealth experts in the community have looked on with shock and horror. During some meetings, they were barred from attending.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarkable to come in and talk to a population that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vulnerable and marginalized and who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily have the capacity for advocacy for themselves, and to take advantage of that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Siman Nuurali, a Somali American clinician who coordinates the care of medically complex patients at Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, told the Post. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abhorrent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral infection that generally causes fever, cough, a runny nose, and a rash. About a third of cases develop complications, including diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia. In rare instances, it can be fatal. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend children get a dose of MMR vaccine between 12 and 15 months, then again between ages 4 and 6. The vaccine is very safe and effective, with two doses being 97 percent effective at preventing infection.\n","8":"The noxious clamoring of a privileged minority has grown louder on Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u201dimperiling public health, a new study warns.\nThe volume of dangerous tweets falsely linking life-saving vaccines to autism spiked dramatically in recent years. But the alarming uptick doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily represent a surge in anti-vaccine sentiments in overall public opinion. Instead, the uptick indicates the amplifying voices of very specific demographics: people from affluent, largely populated areas in just five states\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCalifornia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania.\nThe study\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authors, led by psychologist Theodore Tomeny of the University of Alabama, say the rise is worrying. But, they argue, keeping an eye on social media may help shush the misinformation at its source.\nIn the study, appearing in the October issue of Social Science & Medicine, they conclude:\nThey recommend that pediatricians take note of online trends and\u00e2\u20ac\u201dif the tweets are coming from inside their areas\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpress the issue with patients. Tomeny and colleagues also suggest online interventions, such as a Twitterbot that scans for dangerous tweets and auto-replies with factual health information.\nFor the study, the researchers harvested around 550,000 tweets from January 2009 to August 2015 using keywords related to both autism and vaccines. Then they used a machine learning algorithm to sort the tweets into pro-vaccine, neutral, and anti-vaccine categories. Overall, nearly 273,000 tweets fell into the latter category. Of those, about 108,000 from 47,000 users were geo-coded\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbased mostly on self-disclosed locations in public profiles\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto 732 micro\/metro areas.\nBetween 2009 and 2014, the researchers found that the volume of anti-vaccine tweets was largely stable and low. But beginning in July of 2014, volume began spiking in just five states. For instance, while the monthly average across the country jumped to 250 that month, New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volume increased five-fold. In January of 2015, the spikes continued, with California seeing\u00c2\u00a0a 10-fold leap.\nThe flood of tweets came from areas in those states that had several demographic variables in common. The areas tended to have a relatively higher population size and higher numbers of women who had recently given birth. The areas also tended to have higher numbers of households with annual incomes equal to or more than $200,000. Last, the tweets linked to areas with higher numbers of men between 40 and 44, men who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finish college, and a decrease in women aged 15 to 17.\nThe data largely squares with other demographic data on the anti-vaccine movement that has taken root in recent decades. Those studies consistently found that affluent, married white women with higher education and older birth age are behind the movement.\nBut, the state data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily echo state trends. While California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania were main sources of anti-vaccine falsities on Twitter, recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the movement was having sway in many other states. Between 2009 and 2016, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia saw continued rises in non-medical vaccine exemptions. (California saw a decrease in exemptions in 2015 after a state ban.)\nThe far reach of anti-vaccine messages was evident in a massive measles outbreak in Minnesota this year. The outbreak struck in a Somali immigrant community in Hennepin county but was largely spurred by non-local anti-vaccine advocates.\nSiman Nuurali, a Somali-American clinician who helped respond to the outbreak, told The Washington\u00c2\u00a0Post at the time:\nThe new study on Twitter-based messages has limitations, of course. For one thing, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look at all anti-vaccination messages, and Twitter users make up only about 23 percent of all Internet users\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not nationally representative by any means. Still, the authors argue, the data has value.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Monitoring social media for anti-vaccine beliefs is beneficial for surveillance and intervention efforts to curtail anti-vaccine beliefs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they conclude.\nSocial Science & Medicine, 2017.

The following comments are intended to be a heads up to parents and potential parents about the risks of the Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), and a firsthand report questioning the scientific legitimacy of the vaccine industry, which provides $800 million of annual revenue to Merck \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the company which makes the Hepatitis B vaccine distributed in the US.\nLyla Rose Belkin was a lively, alert five-week-old baby when I last held her in my arms. Little did I imagine as she gazed intently into my eyes with all the innocence and wonder of a newborn child that she would die that night. She was never ill before receiving the Hepatitis B shot that afternoon. At her final feeding that night, she was agitated and feisty \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and then fell asleep and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wake up. The autopsy ruled out choking. A swollen brain was the only abnormal finding. Most doctors I spoke to at the time said it must have been Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a catch-all diagnosis for unexplainable childhood mortality. The first instinctive reaction in such a situation is for parents to blame themselves. For many weeks, my wife and I agonized over what we might have missed or could have done differently. Meanwhile, the logical part of my brain kept returning to the obvious medical event that preceded Lyla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and that internal voice kept asking the question could the Hepatitis B Vaccine that Lyla received that afternoon have killed her? Most doctors I asked scoffed at that notion and said the vaccine was perfectly safe. But I began to search around on the Internet and Medline and discovered disturbing evidence of adverse reactions to this vaccine.\nIn the US, the Hepatitis B disease mainly infects intravenous drug users, homosexuals, prostitutes and promiscuous heterosexuals. The disease is transmitted by blood, through sex or dirty needles. How could a newborn baby possibly get Hepatitis B if the mother was screened and tested negative, as my wife was? It is almost impossible. Unless a newborn child is having unprotected sex or sharing needles with an infected junkie, it is extremely unlikely to get the Hepatitis B disease. So then why are most US babies inoculated at birth by their Hospital or Paediatrician with the Hepatitis B vaccine? That is a question every parent should ask before getting this vaccination. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve discovered the answer is \u00e2\u20ac\u201d an unrestrained health bureaucracy decided it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get junkies, gays, prostitutes and promiscuous heterosexuals to take the Hepatitis B vaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u201d so they mandated that all babies must be vaccinated at birth. Drug companies such as Merck (reaching for new markets) were instrumental in pushing government scientists to adopt an at-birth Hepatitis B vaccination policy, although the vaccine was never tested in newborns and no vaccines had ever been mandated at birth before. It is widely recognized that newborns have under-developed immune systems, which can be overwhelmed or shocked.\nMy search for answers about a link between the Hepatitis B vaccine and my daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death led me to a Hepatitis B vaccine workshop on October 26th at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), Institute of Medicine entitled Vaccine Safety Forum \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Neonatal Deaths. The NAS was concerned enough about reports of Hepatitis B vaccine-related infant deaths and adverse reactions to hold a special workshop on the subject. Doctors and scientists flew in from all over the US and Europe to attend. I sat in the back and soaked it all up. It was a real eye-opener. There were basically four constituencies represented:\n1) Serious scientists observing or presenting research studies.\n 2) Centre for Disease Control (CDC) pseudo-statisticians and FDA officials.\n 3) Merck and other corporate drug officials and\n 4) Parents of vaccine-related dead or severely injured children.\nThe presentations included a study of Animal Models of Newborn Response to Antigen Presentation, which showed that newborn immune systems were undeveloped and strikingly different than those of adults. The message I received was that immune response in a newborn to shocks such as being injected with a vaccine was potentially unknown, since newborn T-Cells have a radically different behaviour then those of adults. Another presentation was Strategies for Evaluating the Biologic Mechanisms of Hepatitis B Vaccine Reactions, in which vaccine researcher Dr. Bonnie Dunbar of Baylor College related numerous Hepatitis B-vaccine related cases of nervous system damage in adults, such as Multiple Sclerosis, seizures and blindness. On the more positive side, the FDA presented a seemingly reassuring study from its Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS), which showed only 19 neonatal deaths reported since 1991 related to Hepatitis B vaccination.\n I found the VAERS study data to be completely deceptive. Since I was sitting in that room and my daughter had died during their sample period and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t counted \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I wondered why. In fact, the New York City Coroner called VAERS to report my daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hepatitis B Vaccine-related infant death and no one ever returned their call! What kind of reporting system doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return the calls of the NY City Medical Examiner \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and how many other reports were ignored? This is supposed to be the emergency 911 number for disasters such as bad lots of vaccine that could poison thousands of other babies. With the personal knowledge that the VAERS data was completely flawed, I sat in that room and listened in amazement as CDC officials and Dr. Sharrar of Merck (their head of vaccine safety) made disparaging comments about any possible risk from Hepatitis B vaccination, despite the evidence just presented by impartial scientists.\nI studied statistics and econometrics at UC Berkeley and have developed innovative methods of applying probability to financial and economic data in my consulting business with some of the largest financial institutions in the world. That training and experience qualifies me to criticize the statistical legitimacy of the VAERS study, on which Sharrar of Merck and the CDC pseudo-scientists based their pro-vaccination stance. Their comments were scathingly dismissive of any possible risk from the vaccine. But that VAERS study is not a legitimate sample of a data set from which any conclusions about the larger population can be made. VAERS doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return coroner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calls, leading to the suspicion that deaths and adverse effects from vaccination are woefully under-reported. To conclude that the Hepatitis B vaccine is safe because VAERS only reports 19 deaths is scientific fraud. In fact, I obtained the raw data from the VAERS system and found 54 reported SIDS cases after Hepatitis B vaccination in just the 18 months from January 1996 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d May 1997. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost 15 times as many deaths per year as their own flawed study reported. There are 17,000 reports of adverse reactions to Hepatitis B vaccine in the 1996-97 raw data. Clearly something is fishy about VAERS. VAERS was set up by the FDA and CDC and is supposed to be monitored by vaccine manufacturers. If there are 17,000 reports and VAERS doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even return the NY Medical Examiner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call, how many other deaths and injuries go unreported? I came away from that NAS workshop with the distinct impression that Merck and the CDC didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really want to know how many babies are being killed or injured by Hepatitis B vaccination. This is a bureaucratic vaccination program that is on auto-pilot flying into a mountain. The CDC bureaucrats have a vested interest in the status quo. If there were 17,000 reports of a dangerous disease in a 18 month period, the CDC would be all over the case. But when there are 17,000 reports of adverse reactions to a vaccine the CDC advocates for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153public health\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the CDC dismisses it as a coincidence. Merck makes $50 a shot from the three-shot series. Where do you think the allegiance of their vaccine safety official Dr. Sharrar lies? He was by far the most arrogant character at the workshop. Merck has sales of upwards of $800 million a year from vaccines.\nVaccination can be a lifesaver if an epidemic is raging, but in this case the risk of vaccination outweighs the risk of infants getting the disease. Surely, the hepatitis B vaccine doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t injure every child that gets it, but in some unknown number of cases, it appears to be a death sentence and\/or a nervous system toxin to innocent children who are at no risk of getting the disease the vaccine is supposed to protect against. My observations of Merck and CDC scientists at the Vaccine Safety Forum left me with the distinct impression that they had absolutely no idea which babies might be killed or injured by this vaccine. Furthermore, they used obviously flawed scientific data to arrogantly steamroller any opposition to their power. Parents should be aware that the Hepatitis B vaccine is not administered for the well-being of their child. Rather, it is delivered by the long arm of some incompetent and mindless bureaucracy in the name of stamping out a disease most babies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possibly get. The Drug Company\/CDC\/FDA alliance has really pulled the wool over the medical profession\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes with the Hepatitis B vaccine. The American Paediatric Society bought the alliance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales pitch and now recommends that all infants get this vaccine at birth. So now the first thing most babies get in life is a shock to their immune system from a vaccine against a non-existent risk of contracting Hepatitis B. Clearly, the interests of newborn babies were not represented on the original panel that created this vaccination policy in 1991. This vaccine has no benefit whatsoever for newborns, in fact it wears off and they will need booster shots later in life when they actually could get exposed to the disease.\nThis is simply a case of ravenous corporate greed and mindless bureaucracy teaming up to overwhelm common sense. Merck in particular has gone way over the edge with this vaccination program. Ignoring and suppressing reports of adverse reactions to their profitable Hepatitis B vaccine verges on criminal conduct. A major media organization will soon present an investigative report on the issues discussed here. Nothing will ever bring my lovely daughter Lyla back, but other needless deaths and injuries can be prevented if this senseless Hepatitis B newborn vaccination program is halted. Please contact Belkin Limited in New York City if you are aware of other infant deaths that may be related to the Hepatitis B vaccine.\nThe department recommends that all newborns and children up to the age of 12 be vaccinated against hepatitis B, which can lead to chronic liver diseases, including cancer. This year, all children entering public school in Texas had to be immunized against hepatitis B, and the shots were offered to seventh-graders in Austin public schools this month.\nThe effort did not come about because hepatitis B poses great risks to children. The virus is primarily transmitted among adults who have unprotected sex, share drug needles or are exposed to contaminated blood. There is also evidence that it can be passed through saliva and tears and from a mother to a child in the womb. Locally, only a few cases of hepatitis B in children are reported each year.\nStill, immunizing all infants is widely considered the only way to protect against an outbreak of the disease. Health departments complain that they cannot get teen-agers and adults to be vaccinated once they have begun risky behavior or other exposure to the virus. Better to immunize them while they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re young and receiving other vaccines, the logic goes, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an argument supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.\nBaylor College of Medicine immunologist Bonnie Dunbar also believes in universal immunizations and has worked for two decades developing vaccines to protect public health. But since watching two people suffer neurological failures after taking the hepatitis B vaccine, she has spoken out against its further use.\nThe vaccine, developed by drug companies Merck and Co. and SmithKline Beecham, was the first recombinant DNA vaccine put on the market in the United States. Unlike conventional vaccines for measles, mumps and polio, the genetically engineered hepatitis B shot does not contain a live form of the virus. Theoretically, the shot won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give you hepatitis B, as sometimes happens with vaccines that contain a live virus. But Dunbar is convinced that in some people, a protein in the recombinant mixture triggers an autoimmune reaction, provoking the body to attack its own nerves and tissue.\nShe has cataloged more than 100 cases of autoimmune disorders found by other scientists, but she can recall two other cases from memory: her brother, whose rashes, joint pain and chronic fatigue have been determined to be side effects of the hepatitis B vaccine; and one of her students, who suffered temporary blindness in one eye and deteriorating eyesight in the other after taking the shot. The CDC and both drug companies acknowledge hearing of similar cases, but they call them extremely rare.\nDunbar worries that newborns who are given the vaccine are even more vulnerable to that risk because of their less formidable defenses. Under Merck guidelines, newborns and teen-agers receive the same dose of the vaccine.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know from our animal lab experiments that the immune system of the neonate is very different from the adult,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dunbar said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has to be studied.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe CDC says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking into the effects of the vaccine and will have results to report next year. Drug companies are also trying to determine how long the immune response to the vaccine lasts before booster shots are needed. That has yet to be established.\n","11":"From the moment I started working on this movie people have asked why I would choose to leave my career as a respected producer on the medical talk show, The Doctors, to make a movie with Dr. Andrew Wakefield, arguably the most controversial figure in modern medicine. The answer is I had no choice.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccines are safe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That is the stated fact from a highly vocal subset of the medical community, everyone who worked around me on The Doctors, and just about any person you stop on the street. But in the fall of 2014 everything changed when I was alerted that a senior scientist from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had become a whistleblower and had confessed on the internet that he and five of his colleagues had committed fraud on their 2004 Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine study when they covered-up the fact that the vaccine was causally associated with autism.\nMore shocking than the accusation that a U.S. government agency was knowingly poisoning millions of its own children with a flawed vaccine was the fact that not a single mainstream newspaper, television or radio show covered the story. As journalists we were either asleep at the wheel or we were in a coma induced by our pharmaceutical sponsors. If it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for Andrew Wakefield (whom I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll refer to as Andy), this story would have never been exposed, and I would still be in a coma.\nUpon meeting Andy I was haunted by all of the headlines that preceded him, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Baby Killer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Father of the anti-vax movement,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fraudulent Doctor who created a fake paper linking vaccines to autism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The doctor who performed unnecessary experiments on innocent children,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the list went on and on. But when Andy showed me the documentary film he was making about Dr. William Thompson, the CDC whistleblower, I was blown away. The evidence was undeniable. The CDC appeared to have lied to the world. It was the biggest story of my lifetime. As an Emmy Award-winning medical producer I knew I had the skill set to guide Andy through the challenges of making a documentary about complicated science, but before I could jump in I had to investigate Andy himself.\nAs soon as I started looking into the facts behind the case against Andy I realized that I had been repeating a lot of bumper sticker slogans about his story that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually true. To begin with I was shocked to discover that Andy never came out against vaccines. WHAT?! What Andy had recommended was that parents vaccinate their children with the single Measles, single Mumps, and single Rubella vaccines instead of the triple MMR vaccine, which many parents were blaming for their child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regression into autism. Seems reasonable enough. More alarming was the realization that the Lancet paper in question clearly states that it does not prove a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Though the majority of parents in the study made this claim, the paper admits that more studies needed to be done before coming to a definitive conclusion. Big smoking gun there?!\nI was surprised to find that the allegations against Andy were not initiated by a medical investigator or scientific institution, but by a freelance journalist named Brian Deer who wrote a Sunday Times article for Rupert Murdoch that was as scientifically accurate as a gossip column. The General Medical Council in the U.K. then used Brian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imaginative retelling of the story behind the Lancet paper as grounds for a medical trial that ultimately stripped Andy of his medical license.\nI had always heard the Lancet paper described as Andrew Wakefield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fraud, but upon actually reading it the first thing one discovers is that there were twelve other co-authors on the paper. The claim that Andy used fake data to create a fraudulent paper is absurd when you realize that among his co-authors were top scientists in their fields who were responsible for performing the tests, outputting the data, and ultimately verifying that it was correctly represented in the paper before signing their names to it. So why is Andy the only one of the 13 co-authors to be barred from practicing medicine? Maybe because he was the only doctor brave enough to ignore pressure from the vaccine manufacturers and the Ministry of Health to begin larger, more in depth studies investigating the hypothesis that the MMR was causing autism in our children; studies that he never got to finish.\nThen there is the assertion that the Lancet study had been paid for by a biased outside source, which is easily refuted by following the paper trail that shows all financial contributions for the study were accepted by the Royal Free Hospital after the study had been completed. Lastly the most disturbing accusation for me was the claim that Andy performed unnecessary procedures on innocent children. That sounds horrible until you discover that the parents had brought their children to the hospital because their children were suffering from agonizing gastrointestinal pain and bowel issues in addition to their autism. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unnecessary procedures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd refers to the colonoscopies and intestinal biopsies that were performed by Andy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colleagues. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how a gastroenterologist is supposed to investigate possible intestinal disease without performing these standard tests, but then again, I am not a doctor. And neither is the journalist who concocted this unfortunate obstruction of medical advancement.\nHistory has shown us time and time again that people like Galileo, who break from the scientific consensus to reveal discoveries like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the earth is not the center of the universe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are often persecuted. I suppose it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of our great human flaws. Both of these men were essentially tried for heresy. The difference is that the imprisonment of Galileo just meant there would be a delay in the advancement of modern astronomy and physics. In Andy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case we may be responsible for a civilization-ending epidemic of autism that has skyrocketed from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 45 children in less than forty years. And still the CDC attempts to set our minds at ease with their official statement \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do not know what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s causing autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nDr. William Thompson has come forward with physical documents and data that strongly indicate the CDC illegally manipulated the data on the MMR study. He has alleged that during the study highly significant increases in the risk of autism were found in several distinct populations and the CDC did everything from kicking children off the study to throwing data out in order to cover it up. Approximately one million children have developed autism since this fraudulent study claimed that the MMR was not responsible. Mathematicians who have plotted the increase of autism on a graph have discovered that it is a perfect exponential curve. If something is not done to stop the trend, by the year 2032 1 in 2 children born will be on the autism spectrum. This is an emergency of epic proportions.\nBy the time you read this there will probably be an outcry funded by the pharmaceutical industry warning people not to see this movie because it is full of lies. Just like the script written against every whistleblower before him, Dr. William Thompson will be called crazy or delusional, even though he has been lauded with awards and bonuses throughout his tenure at the CDC where he still works. They will brush the dust off the manifesto on the Wakefield fraud and send their army of bloggers to shout their sermon on every street corner of the World Wide Web. I honestly can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine the things they will say about me but I doubt it will be pretty. So if you have gotten used to taking your marching orders from corporate lobbyists or are enjoying a sponsor-induced coma, then I recommend that you do what they say and avoid watching this movie. Once you sit down in this theatre you will have crossed the point of no return and you will find that you are in the same predicament as me. Because as Einstein said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those who have the privilege to know have a duty to act.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c Del Bigtree, Producer, March 2016, Los Angeles\nWe need to be sure that what we put in our bodies is not a poison which will harm us. We also need to make certain no one else can force poisons into our bodies and maim or kill us. This should just be good common sense right? Well in California the politicians have already made vaccines mandatory for children an adults working around children. Children who, at there most vulnerable stages of development, endure being poisoned and the consequences that follow or they can not get into public school. If you are rich and send your children to private school, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to worry about it yet. The law does not require children going to private schools be vaccinated. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry it will catch up to them as well, it just takes time to build a consensus with the affluent.\n","12":"A new report suggests that vaccination rates are as low as 50 percent in some areas affected by the current measles outbreak in California.  Image via Shutterstock.\nThe anti-vaccination movement is likely to blame for the recent measles outbreak linked to a Disneyland, according to research published Monday by the Journal of the American Medical Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pediatrics publication.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ongoing measles outbreak linked to the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, shines a glaring spotlight on our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing anti- vaccination movement and the prevalence of vaccination-hesitant parents,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Boston-based scientists wrote in the research paper.\nThe scientists relied on publicly available statistics to draw their conclusions, they said.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rapid growth of cases across the United States indicates that a substantial percentage of the exposed population may be susceptible to infection due to lack of, or incomplete, vaccination,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the researchers wrote.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our study estimates that MMR vaccination rates among the exposed population in which secondary cases have occurred might be as low as 50 percent and likely no higher than 86 percent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the researchers wrote, adding that a percentage of 96 to 99 percent of vaccinated residents is needed to create a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd immunity.\nThe low vaccination rates are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153placing the greater population at risk as well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as those who come into immediate contact with an infected person, according to the researchers.\nTo date, there have been 133 cases of measles reported in the state as a part of this current outbreak that began in December, according to the California Department of Public Health.  \nThe most recent figures show a county breakdown as follows: \nOf the California cases, 40 were traced back to visitors or workers at Disneyland between Dec. 17-20, according to the state.  Thirty more were then traced back to the household or close contacts of a confirmed case.\nEleven people contracted the disease in a community setting such as an emergency room where someone from the above pool was seeking treatment for measles.\nIn 49 cases, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unknown how the disease was contracted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153...but are presumed to be linked to the outbreak based on a combination of descriptive epidemiology or strain type,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd health officials said.\nOf the patients the state has vaccination records for, 57 did not get shots and 20 had one or more doses of the MMR vaccine, according to the state.\nThere are 173 cases reported in 17 states this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Measles cases have been reported in Washington, D.C., Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington.\nThe outbreaks in Illinois, Washington state and Nevada are unrelated to Disneyland, according to the CDC.\nFrom Dec. 28 to March 6, 142 people from seven states came down with measles from the Disneyland outbreak. The states include Arizona, California, Colorado, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah and Washington state, according to the CDC.\nThere were 644 measles cases in 27 states, the most since measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, according to the CDC.\nIn most cases, the victims were unvaccinated, according to the CDC.\nThe CDC reported on Feb. 13 when there were 110 cases of measles, 45 percent were unvaccinated, 5 percent had one dose and 6 percent had two doses and only one person had three doses.\nTwelve of those afflicted with measles were too young to get shots, and of those who were eligible to get shots, 28 intentionally took a pass based on personal beliefs and one had an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alternative plan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for immunization, according to the CDC.\nThe 28 who did not get vaccinated were 18 children and 10 adults, according to the CDC.\nThe patients have ranged in age from six weeks to 70 years, with the median age 22, according to the CDC.\nExperts suspect the outbreak started with a traveler who got infected overseas and then visited Disneyland while infectious, according to the CDC. Scientists say the measles virus in this outbreak matches the one in an outbreak in the Philippines last year.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c City News Service and Patch Editor Renee Schiavone contributed to this report.\n","13":"Greater effort needs to be put into vaccinating dogs against rabies in order to save lives, health experts say. \nUp to 60,000 people die from the viral infection each year and it is almost always caught from dog bites. \nThe Global Alliance for Rabies Control said mass vaccination could \"make rabies history\".\nThe organisation HealthforAnimals argued protecting dogs was the most cost-effective way to protect people. \nRabies is present on every continent except Antarctica, but the overwhelming majority of deaths are in Asia and Africa. \nOnce symptoms develop it is nearly always fatal - although there is a brief window after a bite during which a vaccine can prevent the infection becoming deadly. \nAround 40% of those who are bitten are under 15 years of age.\nCarel du Marchie Sarvaas, executive director of the global animal medicines association HealthforAnimals, told the BBC: \"I don't know if there's a disease which is so easily preventable for so little money that affects so many people.\"\nHe said vaccines were cheap and \u00c2\u00a35 ($8) could vaccinate 20 dogs for a year. \nThe global economic cost is estimated to be \u00c2\u00a380bn ($124bn).\nMr du Marchie Sarvaas said: \"If you look at the economic perspective there's a case to be made, from a human point of view a lot of lives being lost are certainly the case.\n\"The most cost-effective and efficient way to do it is to vaccinate dogs, but then you run into barriers - how much money people make available to buy vaccines, the logistics of getting vaccines into certain areas - it's not easy.\"\nA mass vaccination programme in Bangladesh has halved the number of human deaths since 2011. \nProf Louis Nel, executive director of the Global Alliance for Rabies Control, argued: \"We can make rabies history if international institutions invested more in mass canine vaccinations. \n\"We know we can beat canine rabies if we vaccinate 70% of dogs.\" \n","14":" \t     Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and it is a highly infectious disease that usually causes an itchy red rash with blisters. It is one of the most common childhood diseases, although it can affect adults as well. Most people recover fully from chickenpox, but it can cause complications. A child with chickenpox can miss up to two weeks of school. \n Immunisation against chickenpox is included in the combination measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine for children at 18 months. Until the end of 2017, the varicella vaccine (VV) is also r offered to all 12-13 year old adolescents in year 7 of secondary school through a school-based catch-up program.\n Immunisation can prevent serious medical complications. For children who have not had chickenpox, the vaccine can help protect them against serious complications associated with chickenpox and protect them from developing shingles later in life. Immunised children who get chickenpox generally have a much milder form of the disease. They have fewer skin lesions, a lower fever and recover more quickly.\n Research shows that two doses of chickenpox vaccine in children provides increased protection and reduces the risk of chickenpox occurring at a later time. The government funds one free dose of chickenpox vaccine and a parent can purchase, on prescription, a second dose four to six weeks later if they wish.\n Immunisation against chickenpox is provided free of charge to children under the National Immunisation Program Schedule. Either of two vaccines are used depending on age. The first is a combined vaccine containing protection against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) given at 18 months of age. The second is the varicella vaccine (VV), which immunises only against chickenpox given in year 7 of secondary school or at 12-13 years of age. \n Other adults with no reliable history of chickenpox disease can have a blood test to check their immunity and if they are not immune, they can purchase it with a prescription. MMRV is not recommended for people 14 years and over. People in this age range will be immunised with VV and should be given two doses of VV, one to two months apart. Your immunisation provider can give you more information.\n Both the combination MMRV vaccine and the VV contain a weakened form of VZ that works by causing the body to produce its own antibodies to protect against the virus.\n If you are thinking of becoming pregnant or you are early in your pregnancy, your healthcare professional can check your immunity with a blood test. If you are not immune and not pregnant, you may decide to receive the VV before you become pregnant. The MMRV vaccine is not recommended for people 14 years and over.\n If you are not immune during your pregnancy, you should avoid contact with people who have known cases of chickenpox. Contact your doctor, midwife or hospital as soon as possible if you are exposed to anyone with chickenpox. \n The chickenpox vaccine is effective and safe, but all medications can have unwanted side effects. Side effects from chickenpox vaccine can occur five to 26 days after immunisation and include a mild chickenpox-like rash, usually at the injection site, but occasionally elsewhere on the body.\n Common side effects following immunisation are usually mild and temporary (occurring in the first few days after vaccination).\n If the side effect following immunisation is unexpected, persistent or severe, or if you are worried about yourself or your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s condition after immunisation, see your doctor or immunisation nurse as soon as possible or go directly to a hospital.\n Immunisation side effects may be reported to the Victorian vaccine safety service, the central reporting service in Victoria on (03) 9345 4143. You can discuss with your immunisation provider how to report adverse events in other states or territories. It is also important to seek medical advice if you (or your child) are unwell, as this may be due to other illness, rather than because of the immunisation.\n There is a very small risk of a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to any vaccine. This is why you are advised to stay at the clinic or medical surgery for at least 15 minutes following immunisation in case further treatment is required. Apart from anaphylaxis, other extremely rare side effects include thrombocytopenia (bleeding caused by insufficient blood platelets).\n The immunisations you may need are decided by your health, age, lifestyle and occupation. Together, these factors are referred to as HALO.\n Talk to your doctor or immunisation provider if you think you or someone in your care has health, age, lifestyle or occupation factors that could mean immunisation is necessary. You can check your immunisation HALO using the Immunisation for Life infographic (pdf)\u00c2\u00a0downloadable poster. \n","15":"1\n\u00c2\u00a0\nCowpox (Vaccinia) is not \"weakened smallpox\" (Variola).

A vaccination isn't necessarily the whole pathogen, like the tetanus vaccine is the injection of a tetanus toxoid prepared from the toxin, so you build antibodies toward that (inactive) structure. Likewise, Gardasil is simply inactive viral proteins from HPV. Flu vaccine, however, is indeed attenuated flu strains. I would argue the fundamental difference is inoculation used live organisms where this isnt necessarily true of a vaccine in the modern sense. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0 CMosychuk May 18 '15 at 23:27\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\n@RoverEye That helped.

This can refer to immunization procedures as well as for addition of a microbe to a culture medium in microbiological procedures.\nVaccination specifically refers to an immunization procedure which may involve attenuated pathogens, inactivated toxins (tetanus toxoid) or even specific proteins which are expressed in a lab microbe using recombinant DNA technology (as in case of hepatitis-B vaccine).\nEtymology of both the terms, however, pertains to smallpox immunization. \"Inoculation\" is derived from Latin inoculatus, past participle of inoculare \"graft in, implant a bud or eye of one plant into another [1] . In this procedure, the immunization was done by infecting an individual with a smallpox pustule from a patient (in a way grafting the pox).\n\"Vaccination\" comes from the latin word vacca which means cow. This refers to the vaccine that Edward Jenner derived from cowpox.\n","16":"Have you ever experienced severe diarrhea or vomiting? If you have, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely you had norovirus. If you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, chances are you will sometime in your life. Norovirus is a very contagious virus that anyone can get from contaminated food or surfaces, or from an infected person. It is the most common cause of diarrhea and vomiting (also known as gastroenteritis) and is often referred to as food poisoning or stomach flu. In the United States, a person is likely to get norovirus about 5 times during their life.\nNorovirus has always caused a considerable portion of gastroenteritis among all age groups. However, improved diagnostic testing and gains in the prevention of other gastroenteritis viruses, like rotavirus, are beginning to unmask the full impact of norovirus\nFor most people, norovirus causes diarrhea and vomiting which lasts a few days but, the symptoms can be serious for some people, especially young children and older adults. Each year in the United States, norovirus causes 19 to 21 million illnesses and contributes to 56,000 to 71,000 hospitalizations and 570 to 800 deaths.\nAdditionally, norovirus is increasingly being recognized as a major cause of diarrheal disease around the globe, accounting for nearly 20% of all diarrheal cases. In developing countries, it is associated with approximately 50,000 to 100,000 child deaths every year. Because it is so infectious, hand washing and improvements in sanitation and hygiene can only go so far in preventing people from getting infected and sick with norovirus.\nThis is why efforts to develop a vaccine are so important and why in February 2015 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, CDC Foundation, and CDC brought together norovirus experts from around the world to discuss how to make the norovirus vaccine a reality. Participants were from 17 countries on 6 continents and included representatives from academia, industry, government, and private charitable foundations.\nImportant questions remain regarding how humans develop immunity to norovirus, how long immunity lasts, and whether immunity to one norovirus strain protects against infection from other strains. There are also relevant questions as to how a norovirus vaccine would be used to prevent the most disease and protect those at highest risk for severe illness. These are all critical questions for a vaccine, and this meeting was a step toward finding answers to these questions and making a norovirus vaccine a reality.\nFor more information on norovirus visit CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s webpage: http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/norovirus\/.\nThis is an interesting blog because it is giving a possible solution to a really common problem. Additionally like it was mentioned in this blog, many people in other underdeveloped countries die from this virus. Therefore, these vaccines would be a great solution to theses people in underdeveloped countries because it would decrease the mortality rates and in developed countries it would decrease the discomfort, hospitalization and possible complications due to this virus. Gastroenteritis is a common problem that everyone including myself can relate to because we have all experienced the stomach flu or food poisoning. from this article I have learned that there is possibility for a vaccine for this, which is great!! However, in the meantime I also learned that there are preventative measures that I can take and teach other people about such as frequent hand washing, such as before eating and preparing meals, proper washing\/cleaning of foods and utensils when preparing meals, and proper food storage techniques.\nI had no idea what virus was to blame for a bad case of diarrhea and that everyone will contract this virus in their lifetime. This relates to my life in the way that when somebody including myself have a case of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the runs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we just take pepto bismol and expect the diarrhea to go away when in reality the norovirus causing gastroenteritis is to blame. The adjustment that I can make from the gaining of this knowledge is to keep close attention to the presenting of the norovirus vaccine to the public in order to prevent the contraction of this virus with its awful signs and symptoms. This vaccine would be wonderful to patients that have had to be hospitalized for the norovirus contraction issue.\n   This can relate to something in my life because i have food poisoning several times within this last year and i am hoping that this vaccine will soon become a reality, because having food poisoning is not fun. \nI believe that primary prevention is the best way of stopping the incidents of a disease. Having an immunization against norovirus will save a lot of discomfort for people  who acquired such virus and for parents as well, since it results very painful to see owns child to go over such terrible pain, in addition to the severity of the infection if not catch it on time. I got the virus on my 4th week of pregnancy. I suffered of severe dehydration, and it took me a few hours to figure out that the excessive vomiting was due to a virus and not to the pregnancy.  I will definitely support the research for the development and use of this vaccine for the well-being of the community.\nThis vaccine cannot come fast enough. Thanks to Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for recognizing this as well as all the scientists, academics, and researches that continue to push this issue for a permanent prevention method.  We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come that far with many other illnesses including ones that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause so much pain and suffering and even death to so many.  Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work together to makes sure policy makers and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stand in the way of making a successful NV vaccine a reality soon.  Thank you!\nI find this blog post to be very informative and relevant to patient nursing care. The prevention of a disease that affects 20% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population at least one  to five times in their lives and may potentially be fatal would be a medical breakthrough. The consequences of uncontrolled diarrhea and vomiting can be detrimental, especially to those already ill and immune compromised which makes them more susceptible to disease. the development of an effective vaccine could mean quicker recovery for some patients. The acquisition of such knowledge regarding the common cause of vomiting and diarrhea will definitely result in an increased monitoring of hygiene and cleanliness.\nThis vaccine cannot come soon enough. Even though stomach viruses are short-lived (for most people), they are the most horrible thing when you are going through it. It sometimes seems like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost impossible to NOT catch it once it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in your home due to how contagious it is. I think schools and other facilities need better instructions  from the CDC for how to handle the illness when children are sick in the classroom. I am just amazed when my kids tell me that a child vomited in class, yet the other kids were not evacuated, they were not instructed to wash their hands, and the windows were not opened, and who knows what was used to clean.  I think schools are doing the best they can, but, need to understand that bleach is required to kill the virus as well as other helpful info that could help prevent the spread of it while we patiently wait for the vaccine.\nI believe that a vaccine for norovirus would be beneficial for both developed and developing countries. It is the cause of about 1 in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis in developed countries. It is a smaller fraction (1\/6) for developing countries overall because more cases are due to various other pathogens, but there are less resources in those countries which leads to more possible deaths due to dehydration. The vaccine is necessary for us because norovirus spreads easily and quickly. It is almost unavoidable in a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lifetime. It can spread through air particles from someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vomit or diarrhea, sharing foods, contaminated water sources and sewers. About 50% of food-related illnesses and outbreaks are due to the norovirus, which makes it the leading cause of outbreaks from contaminated foods in America.\nOutbreaks can occur in a number of places including cruise ships, health care facilities, and even schools. These include common locations with mass amounts of people. Recently, a few of my friends caught the stomach flu, and the doctor told them that the virus is going around campus. Throughout a time period of 2 weeks, I had 4 friends who caught the same stomach flu. I feel that college students are very vulnerable to norovirus because it is so common to share food and utensils. The sanitation in cafeterias and bathrooms are also not at the best quality. We are also constantly in close contact with each other during classes.\nI think the norovirus vaccine will prove to be highly successful in decreasing the cases of infections and acute gastroenteritis in general. Because there is now a rotavirus vaccine, norovirus has become the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis. If there is a vaccine for norovirus, the same effect would result as from the rotavirus vaccine.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so glad that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found this topic! I tend to have some form of food poisoning (mild to severe) multiple times a year, so the fact that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a vaccine in the works is uplifting news. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m lucky enough to have the resources to stay healthy while sick with norovirus, but many people in developing countries have died due to this disease and a lack of accessible clean water. Not only would a vaccine save me from days of discomfort and complete weakness, but it could save millions of potential lives lost in developing countries. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m constantly amazed at how many infectious diseases are becoming treatable now, and at the advances that health sciences are making. My only concern is that it is unknown as to if the vaccine will treat other strains of the norovirus or how long the vaccination would last.\nI think it is a very innovative idea to create a vaccine for norovirus. With the increasing rates of Diarrheal Diseases , the rate of Diarrheal Deaths have also gone up in countries like India and Bangladesh, and other countries that also have poor water . I think this will prevent a lot of those such deaths in these countries that are still underdeveloped.  If there was a way to create such a vaccine and make sure the longevity of it was effective as well it would be an extremely effective way of saving lives.\nConsidering the norovirus causes 19 to 21 million illnesses and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in developing countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is associated with 50,000 to 100,000 child deaths every year, a vaccine would be a great benefit for the world. People are likely to get norovirus about 5 times during their life, and with this vaccine, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll not only make people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives much healthier and safer, but will also help make world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health systems more cost efficient \u00e2\u20ac\u201c since this disease contributes to 56,000 to 71,000 and 570 to 800 deaths. Even though in developed countries this disease is not exactly a life-threatening disease, developed countries are in need of this vaccine due to the high amount of child deaths it causes every year.\n \tAdditionally, funding and approving this vaccine should be easier since people from around the world are familiar with this disease. The vaccine will also be highly successful considering the amount of people the norovirus has affected throughout the world, and how infectious it is. Currently, the only way to prevent the disease, is to constantly wash your hands and make your food properly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has proven to be ineffective since people still obtain the disease on the average of 5 times in their lifetime. The vaccine can reduce incidences of food poisoning and make people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives much easier when obtaining sustenance.\nIt is easily preventable as it is easily contractible. From an infected person, food, water, or touching infected surfaces, we can get Norovirus, leading to inflamed stomach and intestines. That alone lead to a lot of discomfort and pain, particularly of the stomach, that sometimes also leads to nausea and vomiting. Although it could be easily prevented by proper hand hygiene, washing fruits and vegetables, and cleaning surfaces with disinfectants, I think having the benefit of the vaccine would be great. Because at the end of the day, not everything is always 100% avoidable or preventable.\nMy 2yr old niece use a restroom at a doctors office, a few days later she showed signs of Norovirus. Doctor said there was nothing he could give her, a few days later she passed it to her 7month sister. It has now been passed down to me. I can only speak for myself, but my if my nieces felt any of the symptoms like I have in the pass 24 hours then I BEG you please work together invent a vaccine, to help combat this virus. I hope there will be an update soon on the topic.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so glad I found this too. I will be first in line for whatever they give and however many hits it takes.\nA vaccine would be great. This is a terrible illness that is extremely contagious and  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure many people would choose to vaccinate. I caught a stomach virus 1.5 years ago which caused damage to the nerves in my stomach. This disorder is called gastroparesis, think of it as paralysis of the stomach. Since my stomach is paralyzed, I have to alter my diet and puree my food in order to eat. I feel sick all the time and sometimes can only eat liquids. This nerve damage can take up to 3 years to repair and there is a 50\/50 chance that it is permanent. As someone previously stated,  schools and workplaces do not allow enough time off to recover, and they also do not know how to properly clean to prevent the spread (bleach is the ONLY cleaning product that will work against these viruses).  I hope this vaccine can help prevent others from catching this virus and suffering from the potentially permanent effects.\nMy 10 yr. old son had the GI bug for NYE 2016 and rung in the new year at the ER with severe dehydration. His symptoms continued for 3 more days with diarrhea and pain. He had missed 2 days of school with active symptoms then he had to miss another 3 days to make sure he did not pass it on because there is a girl in his class with Cancer. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rough, and my hands are so dry from washing every 5 min. or every time I touch a light switch or a wall. I hope this vaccine comes to light soon. Thank you, thank you, for taking the time needed to research this awful virus. As soon as it comes out my son and I will be the first ones in line.\nAre they scheduling another meeting?  It sounds like they came up with a lot of questions, but are they working on answers?  Any clinical trials?  The article just says that the meeting was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an important first step.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  We now need the second step, the third step, and the final step to take place.  I am a teacher and an emetophobe.  I spray disinfectant on surfaces in the classroom, bathroom, and the rest of the building on a regular basis.  However, I have still caught the virus twice in a 20+ year teaching career and that is unacceptable to me.  This is the twenty-first century.  This virus has been around a very long time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough time to study it and come up with a vaccine.  From my understanding, it only takes 5 ppm (parts per million) of exposure to the norovirus particles to get deathly sick.  Unacceptable.  Is there a fund where we can donate $ for research?  What is holding  things up?  What can we do to speed up the research and the vaccine?  A solution is long over-due.\nI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember getting this virus at all as a kid, even though I have six siblings and we all went to school. But now I have two kids younger than school age, and we catch this virus at least twice a year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EVERYWHERE and I have turned phobic about going out in public at all, and if we do go into public, I have panic attacks for the next several days anticipating the vomit to start. Like everyone else here, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather just permanently have a cold or the common flu than EVER get this again. I did hear that the norovirus lacks a lot of proteins, which makes it hard to make a vaccine for. But at the very least, individuals and public places (like schools) seem totally uneducated about how easy it is to spread and how long they have to be quarantined even after they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling better. We have other family friends that I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even want to hang out with anymore because the minute they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no longer puking, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re calling us up for play dates and we had no idea that they were so recently sick until we come down with it. People think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like the common cold.\n Well, my kids are all in college now, and my youngest (22yrs) is so sick. My other two moved into a hotel that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how much they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to get it.\n I had to cancel a flight to visit my elderly mom who has cancer (and I so wanted to be with her.) Because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m fearful of giving it to her.\n","17":"We are fortunate that people in our community worked hard to get the documentary film VAXXED: From Cover-up to Catastrophe to be shown at the Regal 20 Hollywood cinema in Sarasota. I chose to see it yesterday because there was a Q&A with the producers, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, Polly Tommey and Del Bigtree, afterward and I was curious.\u00c2\u00a0\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to lie. My children range in age from 14 years down to a few weeks shy of 5 years old. We did our research and made our decisions about immunizations (which, incidentally, were not the same for all our children) a long time ago. I mainly decided to go because I am often asked about vaccines at some point in childbirth classes or talks with doula clients and I thought this would probably be as close to a mainstream film as a vaccine documentary could possibly get. Similarly to how\u00c2\u00a0The Business of Being Born\u00c2\u00a0brought me a wave of couples looking for a more intervention-free approach to childbirth. I felt I should probably go see it so I would know what clients were referring to.\nLet me just say what surprised me: this is NOT an anti-vaccine film. In fact, at plenty of points along the way, SINGLE-DOSE vaccines are touted as a good thing.\u00c2\u00a0Laudable.\nThis documentary is about corruption. It is about a high-level scientist at the CDC who became a whistleblower when he saw things were not right. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about scientists \u00e2\u20ac\u0153struggling with data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reformatting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd charts to make data become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153statistically insignificant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about data being intentionally and deliberately omitted from studies, about violations of medical ethics.\u00c2\u00a0It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about the critical need for an independent safety board for vaccines, one that is removed from the CDC. We currently have the sickest nation of children\u00c2\u00a0ever\u00c2\u00a0seen before and we owe it to our children to study\u00c2\u00a0why.\u00c2\u00a0It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about some really big stuff that deeply affects far too many families. In fact, really, many would argue it affects every single family, whether they have a vaccine-injured child or not.\nOf course, the film shares some mind-boggling statistics, such as the exponential growth in the number of children diagnosed with autism. If we continue at our current rate, with someone in this country receiving an autism diagnosis\u00c2\u00a0every seven minutes, one of two children in 2032 will be autistic, including 80% of boys. More than 250 vaccines are currently in development (some as cures, not preventive measures). The cradle-to-grave vaccination industry is motivated because if a company gets\u00c2\u00a0just one\u00c2\u00a0vaccination on the recommended schedule, they can make up to $30 billion per year.\nIt may surprise some that vaccines are not classed as pharmaceutical drugs and therefore are not subject to the same testing and double-blind controlled studies as other drugs. This different classification means less rigorous safety controls, not to mention the laws in place right now that protect vaccine manufacturers. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have to pay for vaccine damages as determined by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccine court\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taxpayers who pay out those awards. The vaccine schedule put out by the CDC is determined rather arbitrarily. No studies have been done pertaining to combinations of vaccines. No studies comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated populations have been done.\nSo much is missing.\nAgain, while children are routinely given multiple vaccines in a day, no studies have been done to test the safety of the combination of vaccines the CDC currently recommends. Their studies tend to be reactive, not proactive. A study was mentioned during the Q&A which was done in mice. A group of mice was given 100 cells of disease A. They all survived just fine. Another group of mice was\u00c2\u00a0given 100 cells of disease B. They also survived. A third group of mice was given\u00c2\u00a01 cell\u00c2\u00a0of disease A PLUS\u00c2\u00a01 cell\u00c2\u00a0of disease B.\nMost of those mice died.\nWhile this may be an oversimplification, I think it illustrates the point well that when we give immunizations against, for example, measles and mumps, which are related diseases,\u00c2\u00a0in one shot, the results may be unpredictable. And this deserves to be studied. While many recipients will be fine, many will not be. There are some compelling statistics with regard to age of exposure (much less risk when the MMR vaccine is given after age 3 than between 12-18 months, for example), and race (African-Americans are more likely to be affected in the critical age range), sex (males are more likely to be affected than females), and genetics (consider the MTHFR gene, which plays a role in ridding the body of toxins).\nSo many factors.\nPlease note I did\u00c2\u00a0not\u00c2\u00a0come away from this film thinking all vaccines are bad. Not at all.\nI came away feeling that parents everywhere deserve transparency when it comes to vaccine data. Parents and pediatricians alike deserve an unbiased scientific organization that performs and analyzes studies and issues true and accurate reports on the data, not an organization that has to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153struggle with data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to make it conform to the results they and the pharmaceutical companies that fund their foundations wanted to see. We should put money into the studies that have been requested over and over again by families, by organizations that serve the adversely affected populations, even by politicians.\nWe cannot sit idly by as we are told that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccines do not cause autism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when so many thousands of families share the same story: the story of a typical child meeting their developmental milestones who suddenly regresses within days of a jab. Vaccines do not cause autism in all children, obviously. But all children are unique. Each has a unique combination of genetics, nutrition, environmental factors, gut flora and more. Until we know exactly what\u00c2\u00a0does\u00c2\u00a0cause autism, we cannot say with certainty that a vaccine or a combination of vaccines will not be the tipping point for any particular child.\u00c2\u00a0\nCheck out the\u00c2\u00a0Hear This Well campaign. Check out\u00c2\u00a0VAXXED.\nNote that\u00c2\u00a0the \u00c2\u00a0film calls for the following:\nWhy does all this matter anyway?\nIt matters because as parents, we should have the right to make the best decisions we know how for our child. Of course we want to protect them. If we are comfortable giving single dose vaccines, those should be available. They used to be standard. The vaccines were well studied, successful, with minimal adverse effects. If it gives parents peace of mind, why deny them that option? Why, if public health is truly the number one concern?\nIt matters because pediatricians depend on the CDC to provide the most accurate and most recent information to them so that they can advise their patients. They deserve to have untainted information. They deserve to be able to offer their patients options, such as single dose vaccines.\nCalifornia passed\u00c2\u00a0Senate Bill No. 277\u00c2\u00a0which goes into effect in July of 2016. This will mandate vaccinations for school attendance. While medical exemptions are still allowed, already California authorities are asking schools to send in the exemptions so that parents and doctors can be identified and the reasons for exemptions can be evaluated. No consent is required from parents to have their child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s medical record shared.\u00c2\u00a0This is a slippery slope.\u00c2\u00a0What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next? No vaccines, no health insurance? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food for thought.\nIncidentally, did you know Florida tracks your\u00c2\u00a0immunization records in a statewide, centralized online registry? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called Florida SHOTS. You can opt out if you like.\nVAXXED is still playing for about another week here in Sarasota FL so I highly recommend you go see it if you can.

This may seem far-fetched and implausible to some. As a translator, I have had the opportunity to translate clinical trials, not involving vaccines, but pharmaceutical drugs. I have seen (and translated) the notes among scientific researchers deleting certain questions for or statements to clinical trial participants. In my limited experience, it is\u00c2\u00a0not\u00c2\u00a0inconceivable.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nLetter in which California authorities are asking schools to send in the exemptions:\n","18":"Low vaccination rates likely were the cause of a measles outbreak that began at Disneyland in December 2014, according to research published on Monday in JAMA Pediatrics, NPR's \"Shots\" reports.\nAs of Friday, California had confirmed 133 cases of measles in the state linked to the outbreak that began at Disneyland. Of those, at least 57 had not been vaccinated.\nMeasles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, but low vaccination rates and infected people entering the country from other areas have cause isolated, periodic outbreaks. \nThe measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine is about 95% effective, according to \"shots\" (Hensley, \"Shots,\" NPR, 3\/16).\nFor the research, experts from Boston Children's Hospital and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology examined data on the California outbreak, historical information and other data points.\nThey found that the vaccination rate among individuals that were exposed to measles during the outbreak that began at Disneyland was between 50% and 86% -- far lower than the 96% vaccination rate required to maintain herd immunity.\nThe researchers wrote, \"Clearly, MMR vaccination rates in many of the communities that have been affected by this outbreak fall well below the necessary threshold to sustain herd immunity, thus placing the greater population at risk as well.\" \nEric Handler -- public health officer for Orange County, where Disneyland is located -- said the findings \"underscor[e] the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of measles and protecting children who are too young to be vaccinated\" (Kaplan, \"Science Now,\" Los Angeles Times, 3\/16).\n","19":"What is a vaccine? A vaccine is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease. It contains an agent resembling a disease-inducing microorganism\u00e2\u20ac\u201c a bacterium, virus or toxin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that activates the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system. White blood cells \u00e2\u20ac\u201c APCs, B cells, and T-cells \u00e2\u20ac\u201c recognize, destroy and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remember\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this version of the pathogen. That way, the immune system can quickly recognize and destroy this harmful microorganism later on. A vaccine is essentially a pathogen-imposter.\nToday, there are five main types of vaccines. Live, attenuated vaccines fight viruses and contain a weakened version of the living virus (e.g., measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccine). Inactivated vaccines also fight viruses and contain the killed virus (e.g., polio vaccines). Toxoid vaccines prevent diseases caused by bacteria that produce toxins in the body and contain weakened toxins (e.g., diphtheria and tetanus vaccine). Subunit vaccines include only the essential antigens of the virus or bacteria (e.g. whooping cough vaccine). Conjugate vaccines fight a different type of bacteria which\u00c2\u00a0have antigens with an outer coating of sugar-like substances (polysaccharides) that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hide\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the antigen from the child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immature immune system; the vaccine connects (conjugates) the polysaccharides to antigens, so the immune system can react.\nOnce the altered pathogen is introduced into the bloodstream, it is captured by antigen-presenting cell (APC), which float around looking for invaders. When an APC detects the vaccine antigen, it ingests it, breaks it apart, and displays a piece of the antigen on its surface. Then, it travels to areas where immune cells cluster (e.g. lymph nodes) and where so-called na\u00c3\u00afve T cells specific to the antigen recognize it as foreign and become activated. These T helper cells alert other nearby cells. Na\u00c3\u00afve B cells recognize the antigens carried by the APCs as well and also become activated.\nSome na\u00c3\u00afve B cells mature into plasma B cells after activation by vaccine antigens and reception of signals from activated helper T cells. They produce antibodies which are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153y\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shaped proteins that are released at high levels every second. Each antibody tightly attaches to a specific target antigen (like a lock and a key), which can prevent the antigen from entering a cell or mark the antigen for destruction. If the vaccine contains weakened viruses, they enter the cells which are then killed by Killer T cells. What follows is the development of memory (B, T helper and killer T) cells that memorize the vaccine antigen and recognize the real pathogen in the future.\nThis means that the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response will be stronger and faster than if it had never encountered the pathogen before. This is called a secondary response to the pathogen. Furthermore, secondary responses will result in the production of more antibodies to fight the pathogen and more memory cells to identify it promptly. Thus, vaccinations \u00e2\u20ac\u0153program\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the immune system to remember a specific disease-inducing microorganism by letting it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153practice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a weakened, killed or inactivated version of the pathogen.\nVaccines can prevent outbreaks of contagious diseases through herd immunity (or community immunity). This means that a sufficient portion of the population must be immune to an infectious disease (by vaccination and\/or prior illness), so that the disease is less likely to spread from one person to another. As the number of vaccinated people increases, the protective effect of herd immunity increases as well. While the herd immunity threshold may start with 40% of the population vaccinated for some diseases, most diseases require vaccination rates as high as 80% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 95% to prevent outbreaks. Moreover, herd immunity protects those who cannot be vaccinated or for whom the vaccination was not successful, such as people with weak immune systems, chronic illnesses or allergies.\nVaccinations are essentially prophylactic, although there has been an effort in recent years to develop therapeutic vaccinations for infectious diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis, cancer, and various autoimmune diseases. There are also potential vaccinations in development for myasthenia gravis, lupus and diabetes, as well as for cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease, prion diseases and Huntington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease.\nUsually, vaccinations are administered in the form of an injection into the skin or a liquid taken orally. However, some vaccinations may also be processed by inhalation through mouth\/nose or application onto the skin. The vaccines risks are very low. Most vaccine reactions are usually minor and temporary (i.e. sore arm, fatigue or an elevated temperature). Very serious side effects like severe allergic reactions are extremely rare and are carefully monitored and investigated. The vaccine benefits definitely outweigh the vaccine dangers. In fact, it is far more likely to be seriously harmed by a vaccine-preventable disease than by the vaccine itself.\nIn recent years, the anti-vaccination movement has been claiming that there is a link between vaccinations and autism. The reason for these claims is a 1998 study, which suggested that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine might cause autism. Its publication started a panic among parents that led to dropping vaccination rates, resulting in subsequent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. However, this study turned out to be seriously flawed, and the paper was even retracted by the journal that published it. There is absolutely no evidence of a link between vaccines and autism or autistic disorders.\nSources:\n","20":"These revised recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) on Measles Prevention replace previous recommendations published in 1987 (1) and 1989 (2). The recommendations include a basic change in the routine childhood vaccination schedule from a one-dose to a two-dose schedule using combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Routine revaccination will generally be implemented one age group at a time starting with school enterers. New recommendations are also included for vaccination of preschool children at high risk of contracting measles, for students in colleges and other institutions of higher education, for health-care personnel and international travelers, and for outbreak control. \nINTRODUCTION \nMeasles (rubeola) is often a severe disease, frequently complicated by middle ear infection or bronchopneumonia. Encephalitis occurs in approximately one of every 1,000 reported cases; survivors of this complication often have permanent brain damage and mental retardation. Death, usually from respiratory and neurologic causes, occurs in one of every 1,000 reported measles cases. The risk of death is greater for infants and adults than for children and adolescents. \nSubacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a \"slow virus\" infection of the central nervous system associated with measles virus. Widespread use of measles vaccine has led to the virtual disappearance of SSPE from the United States (3). \nMeasles illness during pregnancy leads to increased rates of premature labor, spontaneous abortion, and low-birth-weight infants (4,5). Whether measles infection in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased rate of congenital malformations is still unresolved. \nBefore measles vaccine was available, more than 400,000 measles  cases were reported each year in the United States (6). However, since virtually all children acquired measles, the true number of cases probably exceeded 4 million per year (i.e., the entire birth cohort). Since 1963, when both an inactivated and a live attenuated vaccine (Edmonston B strain) were licensed for use in the United States, both the type of measles vaccine and the recommended age for measles vaccination have changed several times. After 1967 and 1975, the inactivated and the Edmonston B vaccine, respectively, were no longer distributed. A live, further attenuated vaccine (Schwarz strain) was first introduced in 1965, and a similar vaccine (Moraten strain) was licensed in 1968. These further attenuated vaccines cause fewer reactions than the Edmonston B vaccine, yet are equally effective. The Moraten vaccine is the vaccine used currently in the United States. \nA single dose of live measles vaccine had been recommended since measles vaccine was first licensed (1). In 1963, the recommended age for vaccination was 9 months, but in 1965 it was changed to 12 months, and in 1976 it was changed to 15 months because of evidence demonstrating greater efficacy when children were vaccinated at these ages. Persons vaccinated before the first birthday needed to be revaccinated. \nMEASLES EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ELIMINATION EFFORTS \nSince vaccine licensure in 1963, the collaborative efforts of professional and voluntary medical and public health organizations in vaccination programs have resulted in a 99% reduction in the reported incidence of measles. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the number of reported cases decreased to between 22,000 and 75,000 cases per year. Although incidence fell dramatically in all age groups, children less than 10 years of age showed the greatest decline, while older children had a slightly less dramatic decrease. As a result, the proportion of total cases occurring in different age groups changed. From 1984 to 1988, 58% of reported cases affected children greater than or equal to 10 years of age, compared with 10% during the period 1960 to 1964 (6). \nIn 1978, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare initiated a Measles Elimination Program, with a goal to eliminate indigenous measles from the United States by October 1, 1982. The three components of this program have been 1) maintenance of high levels of immunity, 2) careful surveillance of disease, and 3) aggressive outbreak control. As a result of these efforts, the number of cases reported annually dropped from 26,871 in 1978 to an all-time low of 1,497 in 1983. The number of cases reported then increased until 1986 (6,282) cases (7). Reported cases decreased in 1987 and 1988 but rose again during the first 48 weeks of 1989, when more than 14,000 cases were reported. \nMeasles cases are routinely reported by state and local health departments to the MMWR. The Division of Immunization, Center for Prevention Services, CDC, collects supplementary data on cases, including information on vaccination status (i.e., vaccinated or unvaccinated). Persons appropriately vaccinated for measles are those who have received a dose of live measles vaccine on or after their first birthday. \nUnvaccinated persons with measles can be subclassified into three general groups: those for whom vaccine is not routinely indicated (e.g., those less than 16 months of age, born before 1957, with prior physician diagnosis of measles, or with medical contraindications), those for whom vaccination is difficult to achieve (e.g., non-U.S. citizens and persons exempted for religious or philosophic reasons), and those for whom vaccine is indicated (e.g., children greater than or equal to 16 months of age and children vaccinated before their first birthdays). From 1985 through 1988, information on vaccination status for 16,819 measles cases was collected by the Division of Immunization. Appropriately vaccinated persons accounted for 42%, and 92% of cases in this group occurred among persons greater than or equal to 5 years of age. In 26% of these cases, the patients were unvaccinated persons for whom vaccine was not routinely indicated or for whom vaccination was difficult to achieve. The remaining 32% were unvaccinated persons for whom vaccine was indicated. Forty-two percent of the persons in this latter group were children 16 months to 4 years of age. \nIn recent years, two major types of outbreaks have occurred in the United States: those among unvaccinated preschool-aged children, including those younger than the recommended age for vaccination (i.e., less than 15 months), and those among vaccinated school-aged children (8). In addition, particularly in 1989, a substantial number of cases occurred among students and personnel on college campuses. Large outbreaks occurred among unvaccinated preschool-aged children in several inner-city areas. In these outbreaks, of the cases that occurred among vaccine-eligible children 16 months-4 years of age, up to 88% of the children were unvaccinated. As many as 40% of cases occurred among children less than 16 months of age. In some of these areas, surveys indicate that 49%-65% of 2-year-olds had received measles vaccine (9). Among school-aged children, outbreaks have occurred in schools with vaccination levels of greater than 98%. These outbreaks have occurred in all parts of the country, including areas that had not reported measles for years. \nIn general, attack rates in individual schools were low (1%-5%)  and the calculated vaccine efficacy high. Most of the persons with measles in college outbreaks were also likely to have been vaccinated, although documentation of vaccination was often lacking. However, in many outbreaks, children vaccinated at 12-14 months of age had higher attack rates than those vaccinated at older ages (10). In a few outbreaks, older persons vaccinated in the more distant past were at increased risk for disease; this risk was independent of age at vaccination (11). \nThe goal of eliminating measles in the United States has not been reached primarily because of 1) failure to implement the current vaccination strategy, resulting in large numbers of unvaccinated preschool-age children in some areas, and 2) vaccine failure. A substantial number of cases occur among persons who previously have been vaccinated. Theoretically, vaccine failures may either be primary (i.e., an adequate response to vaccination never developed) or secondary (i.e., an adequate response initially developed, but immunity was lost over time). Some of the reported vaccine failures may be explained by the fact that a person's records incorrectly indicated appropriate vaccination. Measles vaccine is at least 95% effective for children vaccinated at greater than or equal to 15 months of age. However, efficacy may be slightly lower for persons vaccinated between 12 and 14 months of age, presumably because transplacental maternal antibody persists beyond the first birthday in some children and interferes with the response to vaccination. Also, secondary vaccine failure could occur after successful vaccination as a result of waning immunity, but the percentage of persons to whom this applies appears to be small (12,13). Overall, the great majority of vaccinees appear to have long-term and probably life-long immunity. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to determine the duration of vaccine-induced immunity. \nCHANGES IN MEASLES VACCINATION POLICY \nThe Committee reviewed current measles epidemiology and the measles elimination strategy and considered modifications. New recommendations were developed to help achieve the goal of measles elimination (Table_1 and Table_2). A routine two-dose measles vaccination schedule now is recommended. This schedule is expected to provide protection to most persons who do not respond to their initial vaccination. \nThe first dose is recommended at 15 months of age for children in most areas of the country but at 12 months of age for children in some areas with recurrent measles transmission. The second dose is recommended at the time a child enters school at kindergarten or first grade (see \"Vaccine Usage\"). Because programs to administer a second dose of measles vaccine at school entry to kindergarten or first grade will not have an immediate effect on the incidence of measles for school-aged children, programs also are recommended for outbreak control (see \"Outbreak Control\") and for the routine vaccination of students entering college (see \"Special Situations \"). \nWhen fully implemented, this schedule should lead to the elimination of measles among school-aged children and college students. It is expected to prevent the 35%-40% of cases affecting persons greater than or equal to 5 years of age who appear to be vaccine failures, and it may indirectly protect unvaccinated persons since the risk of exposure to measles will decrease. Outbreaks of measles in school settings are likely to cease, thus avoiding the substantial disruption of routine activities and the high cost of outbreak control. However, the overall goal of  eliminating measles in the United States also requires more intensive efforts to vaccinate preschool children at the recommended ages, particularly children residing in inner cities. \nAll contacts with health-care providers in physicians' offices,  clinics, emergency rooms, and hospitals are opportunities for evaluating the vaccination status of children, both patients and accompanying siblings, and for offering vaccine to those who need it. Unvaccinated children should not be rescheduled for vaccination; rather, they should be vaccinated immediately if no contraindication exists. Particular attention should be paid to offering simultaneous vaccination. No preschool child who needs MMR should be offered other vaccines without being offered MMR. Special efforts are also needed to educate and motivate parents to have such children vaccinated. \nMEASLES VIRUS VACCINE \nLive measles virus vaccine * used in the United States is prepared in chick-embryo-cell culture. It is available in monovalent (measles only) form and in two combinations: measles-rubella (MR) and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines **. \nMeasles vaccine produces an inapparent or mild, noncommunicable  infection. Measles antibodies develop in at least 95% of susceptible children vaccinated at greater than or equal to 15 months of age. Although the titers of vaccine-induced antibodies are lower than those following natural disease, both serologic and epidemiologic evidence indicate that vaccine-induced protection appears to be long-lasting in most individuals. \nVaccine Shipment and Storage \nThe administration of improperly stored vaccine may fail to provide protection against measles. Although the current measles vaccine may be more thermostable than vaccine produced in the past, it should be stored at 2-8 C (35.6-46.4 F) or colder during storage. Vaccine must be shipped at 10 C (50 F) or colder and may be shipped on dry ice. It must be protected from light, which may inactivate the virus. Reconstituted vaccine must be stored in a refrigerator (not frozen) and discarded if not used within 8 hours. \nVACCINE USAGE \nGeneral Recommendations \nAll vaccines containing measles virus are recommended for routine use for children 15 months of age. Persons born in or after 1957 who lack documentation of measles immunity (see \"Measles Immunity\") are considered susceptible and should be vaccinated if there are no contraindications (see \"Precautions and Contraindications\"). All vaccinations should be documented in the patient's permanent medical record (14). A parental history of vaccination, by itself, is not considered adequate documentation. A physician should not provide an immunization record for a patient unless s\/he has administered the vaccine or has seen a record that documents vaccination. Most persons born before 1957 are likely to have been naturally infected with measles virus and generally need not be considered susceptible; however, vaccination may be offered to these persons if there is reason to believe they may be susceptible. \nBoth doses of measles vaccine should be given as combined MMR vaccine when given on or after the first birthday. The combined vaccine is preferred to assure immunity to all three viruses. Mumps revaccination is particularly important. Recent studies have shown that mumps can occur in highly vaccinated populations, resulting in substantial numbers of cases among persons with histories of prior mumps vaccination. Although rubella vaccine failure has not been a major problem, the potential consequences of rubella vaccine failure are substantial (i.e., congenital rubella syndrome), and the use of MMR should provide an additional safeguard against such failures. \nThe most commonly used laboratory test for assessing immunity to measles has been the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. Other more sensitive assays, such as the enzyme immuno-assay (EIA), are now being used by many laboratories. Persons with measles-specific antibody, detectable by any test, are considered immune. Routine serologic screening to determine measles immunity is not generally recommended, although it may be cost-effective in some situations (e.g., large prepaid medical programs). However, the test may not be widely available, and screening requires that tracking systems be established to assure that identified susceptibles return for vaccination. In addition, screening for antibodies for mumps and rubella would further decrease the cost-effectiveness of this strategy. \nDosage \nTwo doses of measles vaccine, generally given as MMR, are recommended for all children after the first birthday. The dose is 0.5 ml and should be given subcutaneously. \nAge at Vaccination \nRoutine childhood immunization schedule for most areas of the  United States \nThe first dose of measles vaccine should be given when children  are greater than or equal to 15 months of age. The second dose should routinely be given when children enter kindergarten or first grade (4-6 years of age). \nThe recommended time for the second dose is based primarily on administrative considerations. The current childhood immunization schedule recommends other vaccines (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP) and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV)) when children enter school; therefore, an additional provider visit for the second dose of measles vaccine is not necessary. In addition, most school authorities have systems at this grade level for identifying and tracking children with incomplete immunizations. \nBecause many of the vaccine failures in recent outbreaks of measles have occurred among 10 to 19-year-old children and adolescents, administering the second dose at the time of school entry may not achieve full impact on the incidence of measles for 5 to 15 years. For the impact to occur more rapidly, some localities may choose to give students the second dose at an older age (e.g., when they enter middle school or junior high school). In deciding when to administer the second dose, health officials should consider how they can best achieve a high vaccination rate since this is essential to assure maximum impact of a two-dose schedule. Some localities may want to provide a second dose to multiple age groups from kindergarten through 12th grade to achieve complete immunization of all school-aged children more rapidly. \nChildren who have received two doses of live measles vaccine on  or after the first birthday (at least 1 month apart) do not need an additional dose when they enter school. Children who have no documentation of live measles vaccination when they enter school should be admitted after the first dose. A second dose should be given according to local policy, but no less than 1 month later. \nRoutine childhood immunization schedule for areas with recurrent  measles transmission \nInitial vaccination with MMR at 12 months of age is recommended  for children living in high-risk areas. This strategy assumes that the benefit of preventing measles cases between 12 and 15 months of age outweighs the slightly lower efficacy of the vaccine when given at this age. A high-risk area is defined as: \n     a county with more than five cases among preschool-aged     children during each of the last 5 years, 2) a county with a     recent outbreak among unvaccinated preschool-aged children, or 3)     a county with a large inner-city urban population. These     recommendations may be implemented for an entire county or only     in defined high-risk areas. \nRevaccination of Persons Vaccinated According to Earlier  Recommendations \nPrevious vaccination with live vaccine \nPersons vaccinated with live measles vaccine before their first  birthday should be considered unvaccinated. If they are entering kindergarten or first grade, college or other post-high school educational institutions (see \"Special Situations\"), or beginning employment in a medical facility (see \"Special Situations\") and cannot provide documentation of immunity to measles (see \"Measles Immunity\"), they should receive two doses of vaccine no less than 1 month apart. \nLive attenuated Edmonston B vaccine (distributed from 1963-1975) was usually administered with immune globulin (IG) or high-titer measles immune globulin (MIG; no longer available in the United States). This vaccine, administered on or after the first birthday, is acceptable as an effective first dose of vaccine. A second dose should be administered as recommended above. However, if a further attenuated measles vaccine (i.e., Schwarz or Moraten) was given simultaneously with IG or MIG, the IG or MIG may have impaired the immune response to vaccination. Persons who received measles vaccine of unknown type or further attenuated measles vaccine accompanied by IG or MIG should be considered unvaccinated and should be given two doses of vaccine as outlined above. \nPrevious vaccination with inactivated vaccine or vaccine of unknown  type \nInactivated (killed) measles vaccine was available in the United States only from 1963 to 1967 but was available through the early 1970s in some other countries. It was frequently given as a series of two or three injections. Some persons who received inactivated vaccine are at risk of developing severe atypical measles syndrome when exposed to the natural virus (15). Consequently, such persons should receive two doses of live vaccine separated by no less than 1 month. Persons vaccinated with inactivated vaccine followed within 3 months by live vaccine should be revaccinated with two doses of live vaccine. Revaccination is particularly important when the risk of exposure to natural measles virus is increased, as may occur during international travel. \nA wide range (4%-55%) of recipients of inactivated measles vaccine who were later revaccinated with live measles vaccine have had reactions to the live vaccine (16). Most of these reactions have been mild, consisting of local swelling and erythema, with or without low-grade fever lasting 1-2 days. Rarely, more severe reactions, including prolonged high fevers and extensive local reactions, have been reported. However, recipients of inactivated measles vaccine are more likely to have serious illness when exposed to natural measles than when given live measles virus vaccine. \nThese same recommendations for revaccination apply to persons vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 with vaccine of unknown type, since they may have received inactivated vaccine. Since inactivated measles vaccine was not distributed in the United States after 1967, persons vaccinated after 1967 with a vaccine of unknown type need not be revaccinated routinely unless the original vaccination occurred before the first birthday or was accompanied by IG or MIG. However, such persons should receive a second dose if they are entering college, beginning employment in medical facilities, or planning international travel. \nMeasles Immunity \nPersons are considered immune to measles if they 1) were born before 1957, 2) have documentation of physician-diagnosed measles, 3) have laboratory evidence of immunity to measles, or 4) have documentation of adequate vaccination. Eventually, adequate vaccination will be defined as receipt of one dose of live measles vaccine on or after the first birthday for children before they enter school and two doses of measles vaccine on or after the first birthday for children who are entering or have entered school. \nFor localities implementing the second dose for students at ages beyond school entry (e.g., entry to middle school or junior high school), acceptable evidence of immunity will be one dose at school entry and two doses for students older than the routine age of the second dose (see \"Age at Vaccination\"). \nSince most areas will implement the two-dose schedule one age group at a time, criteria for adequate vaccination will vary in the interim. For example, if the two-dose schedule is implemented in 1990, children in kindergarten or first grade will need to have documentation of two doses of measles vaccine after the first birthday to be considered adequately vaccinated. However, a single dose of vaccine will be acceptable evidence of adequate vaccination for children in higher grades. Two years later, children in kindergarten through second or third grade will need two doses of measles vaccine for acceptable evidence of adequate vaccination. Similar criteria would apply if the second-dose strategy is implemented at an older age (see \"Age at Vaccination\"). \nThe interim vaccination criteria for adequate measles vaccination noted above apply to routine settings only. During outbreaks, all persons at risk and born in or after 1957 who are in kindergarten, first grade, or beyond will need two doses on or after the first birthday as evidence of adequate vaccination (see \"Outbreak Control\"). \nIndividuals Exposed to Disease \nUse of vaccine \nExposure to measles is not a contraindication to vaccination. If live measles vaccine is given within 72 hours of measles exposure, it may provide some protection. This approach is preferable to using IG for persons greater than or equal to 12 months of age. If the exposure does not result in infection, vaccination should induce protection against subsequent measles infection. \nUse of IG \nIG can prevent or modify measles in a susceptible person if given within 6 days of exposure. The recommended dose of IG is 0.25 ml\/kg (0.11 ml\/lb) of body weight (maximum dose = 15 ml). IG may be especially indicated for susceptible household contacts of measles patients, particularly contacts less than 1 year of age, pregnant women, or immunocompromised persons, for whom the risk of complications is increased. The recommended dose of IG for immunocompromised persons is 0.5 ml\/kg of body weight (maximum dose = 15 ml). Live measles vaccine should be given 3 months later (when passively acquired measles antibodies should have disappeared) if the individual is then at least 15 months old. IG should not be used to control measles outbreaks. \nSpecial Situations \nRecommendations for colleges and other institutions \nColleges, technical schools, and other institutions for post-high school education should require documentation of two doses of live measles-containing vaccines, documentation of prior physician-diagnosed measles disease, or laboratory evidence of measles immunity before entry for all students born in or after 1957. Students who have no documentation of live measles vaccination or other evidence of measles immunity at the time of school entry should be admitted after receiving the first dose. A second dose should be given no less than 1 month later. Institutions may wish to extend this requirement to all classes. \nRecommendations for medical facilities \nMedical personnel are at higher risk for acquiring measles than  the general population (17). Hospitals should require evidence of two live measles vaccinations, documentation of physician-diagnosed measles disease, or laboratory evidence of measles immunity for medical staff beginning employment who will have direct patient contact. Persons born in or after 1957 who have no documentation of vaccination or other evidence of measles immunity should be vaccinated at the time of employment and revaccinated no less than 1 month later. If resources are available, institutions may wish to extend this recommendation to all medical personnel, not just those beginning employment. Since some medical personnel who have acquired measles in medical facilities were born before 1957, institutions may consider requiring at least one dose of measles vaccine for older employees who are at risk of occupational exposure to measles. \nRecommendations for international travel \nPersons traveling abroad should be immune to measles. The protection of young adults who have escaped measles disease and have not been vaccinated is especially important. Consideration should be given to providing a dose of measles vaccine to persons born in or after 1957 who travel abroad, who have not previously received two doses of measles vaccine, and who do not have other evidence of measles immunity (see \"Measles Immunity\"). \nThe age for measles vaccination should be lowered for children traveling to areas in which measles is endemic or epidemic. Children 12-14 months of age should receive MMR vaccine before their departure. Children 6-11 months of age should receive a dose of monovalent measles vaccine before departure, although there is no specific contraindication to the use of MMR for this age group if monovalent measles vaccine is not available. Seroconversion rates observed for measles, mumps, and rubella antigens are significantly less among children vaccinated before the first birthday than among older children. Children who receive monovalent measles vaccine or MMR before their first birthday should be considered unvaccinated and should receive two doses of MMR at later ages. Whereas the optimal age for the first revaccination dose is 15 months, the age for revaccination may be as low as 12 months if the child remains in a high-risk area (see \"Routine childhood immunization schedule for areas with recurrent measles transmission\"). The second revaccination dose would normally be given when a child enters school or according to local policy. \nSince virtually all infants less than 6 months of age will be protected by maternally derived antibodies, no additional protection against measles is necessary in this age group. \nSIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS \nMore than 170 million doses of measles vaccine were distributed  in the United States from 1963 through 1988. The vaccine has an excellent record of safety. From 5%-15% of vaccinees may develop a temperature of greater than or equal to 103 F (greater than or equal to 39.4 C) beginning 5-12 days after vaccination and usually lasting several days (18). Most persons with fever are otherwise asymptomatic. Transient rashes have been reported for approximately 5% of vaccinees. Central nervous system conditions, including encephalitis and encephalopathy, have been reported with a frequency of less than one per million doses administered. The incidence of encephalitis or encephalopathy after measles vaccination of healthy children is lower than the observed incidence of encephalitis of unknown etiology. This finding suggests that the reported severe neurologic disorders temporally associated with measles vaccination were not caused by the vaccine. These adverse events should be anticipated only in susceptible vaccinees and do not appear to be age-related. After revaccination, reactions should be expected to occur only among the small proportion of persons who failed to respond to the first dose. \nPersonal and Family History of Convulsions \nAs with the administration of any agent that can produce fever,  some children may have a febrile seizure. Although children with a personal or family history of seizures are at increased risk for developing idiopathic epilepsy, febrile seizures following vaccinations do not in themselves increase the probability of subsequent epilepsy or other neurologic disorders. Most convulsions following measles vaccination are simple febrile seizures, and they affect children without known risk factors. \nAn increased risk of these convulsions may occur among children  with a prior history of convulsions or those with a history of convulsions in first-degree family members (i.e., siblings or parents) (19). Although the precise risk cannot be determined, it appears to be low. \nIn developing vaccination recommendations for these children, the Committee considered a number of factors, including risks from measles disease, the large proportion (5%-7%) of children with a personal or family history of convulsions, and the fact that convulsions following measles vaccine are uncommon and have not been associated with permanent brain damage. The Committee concluded that the benefits of vaccinating these children greatly outweigh the risks. They should be vaccinated just as children without such histories. \nBecause the period for developing vaccine-induced fever occurs approximately 5-12 days after vaccination, prevention of febrile seizures is difficult. Prophylaxis with antipyretics is one alternative, but these agents may not be effective if given after the onset of fever. They would have to be initiated before the expected onset of fever and continued for 5-7 days. However, parents should be alert to the occurrence of fever after vaccination and should treat their children appropriately. \nChildren who are being treated with anticonvulsants should continue to take them after measles vaccination. Because protective levels of most currently available anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., phenobarbitol) are not achieved for some time after therapy is initiated, prophylactic use of these drugs does not seem feasible. \nThe parents of children who have either a personal or family history of seizures should be advised of the small increased risk of seizures following measles vaccination. In particular, they should be told in advance what to do in the unlikely event that a seizure occurs. The permanent medical record should document that the small risk of postimmunization seizures and the benefits of vaccination have been discussed. \nRevaccination Risks \nThere is no evidence of increased risk from live measles vaccination in persons who are already immune to measles, as a result of either previous vaccination or natural disease. \nPRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS \nPregnancy \nLive measles vaccine, when given as a component of MR or MMR, should not be given to women known to be pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant within the next 3 months. Women who are given monovalent measles vaccine should not become pregnant for at least 30 days after vaccination. This precaution is based on the theoretical risk of fetal infection, although no evidence substantiates this theoretical risk. Considering the importance of protecting adolescents and young adults against measles, asking women if they are pregnant, excluding those who are, and explaining the theoretical risks to the others before vaccination are sufficient precautions. \nFebrile Illness \nThe decision to administer or delay vaccination because of a current or recent febrile illness depends largely on the cause of the illness and the severity of symptoms. Minor illnesses, such as a mild upper-respiratory infection with or without low-grade fever, are not contraindications for vaccination. For persons whose compliance with medical care cannot be assured, every opportunity should be taken to provide appropriate vaccinations. \nChildren with moderate or severe febrile illnesses can be vaccinated as soon as they have recovered. This wait avoids superimposing adverse effects of vaccination on the underlying illness or mistakenly attributing a manifestation of the underlying illness to the vaccine. Performing routine physical examinations or measuring temperatures are not prerequisites for vaccinating infants and children who appear to be in good health. Asking the parent or guardian if the child is ill, postponing vaccination for children with moderate or severe febrile illnesses, and vaccinating those without contraindications are appropriate procedures in childhood immunization programs. \nAllergies \nHypersensitivity reactions following the administration of live  measles vaccine are rare. Most of these reactions are minor and consist of a wheal and flare or urticaria at the injection site. More than 170 million doses of measles vaccine have been distributed in the United States, but only five reported cases of immediate allergic reactions have occurred among children who had histories of anaphylactic reactions to egg ingestion. These reactions could potentially have been life threatening. Four children experienced difficulty in breathing, and one of these four had hypotension. Persons with a history of anaphylactic reactions (hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty in breathing, hypotension, and shock) following egg ingestion should be vaccinated only with extreme caution. Protocols have been developed for vaccinating such persons (20,21). However, persons are not at increased risk if they have egg allergies that are not anaphylactic in nature; they can be vaccinated in the usual manner. Persons with allergies only to chickens or feathers are not at increased risk of reaction to measles vaccination. \nMMR vaccine and its component vaccines contain trace amounts of  neomycin. Although the amount present is less than that usually used for a skin test to determine hypersensitivity, persons who have experienced anaphylactic reactions to neomycin should not be given these vaccines. Most often, neomycin allergy is manifested by contact dermatitis rather than anaphylaxis. A history of contact dermatitis to neomycin is not a contraindication to receiving measles vaccine. Live measles virus vaccine does not contain penicillin. \nRecent Administration of IG \nVaccine virus replication and stimulation of immunity usually occurs 1-2 weeks after vaccination. When the live measles vaccine is given after IG or specific IG preparations, the vaccine virus might not replicate successfully, and the antibody response could be diminished. Measles vaccine should not be given for at least 6 weeks, and preferably for 3 months, after a person has been given IG, whole blood, or other antibody-containing blood products. If vaccine is given to a person who has received such products within the preceding 3 months, the dose should not be counted and the person should be revaccinated approximately 3 months later unless serologic testing indicates that measles-specific antibodies have been produced. For international travelers, measles vaccination should precede the administration of IG by at least 2 weeks to preclude interference with replication of the vaccine virus. If the interval between measles vaccination and subsequent administration of an IG preparation is less than 14 days, vaccination should be repeated 3 months later, unless serologic testing indicates that antibodies were produced. \nTuberculosis \nTuberculosis may be exacerbated by natural measles infection. Live measles virus vaccine has not been shown to have such an effect. Tuberculin skin testing is not a prerequisite for measles vaccination. If tuberculin testing is needed for other reasons, it can be done the day of vaccination. Otherwise, the test should be postponed for 4-6 weeks, since measles vaccination may temporarily suppress tuberculin reactivity. \nAltered Immunocompetence \nReplication of vaccine viruses can be enhanced in persons with immune-deficiency diseases and in persons with immunosuppression, as occurs with leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, or therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large doses of corticosteroids. For this reason, patients with such conditions or therapies (except patients with symptomatic infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); see below) should not be given live measles virus vaccine. \nPatients with leukemia in remission who have not received chemotherapy for at least 3 months may receive live-virus vaccines. Short-term (less than 2 weeks), low- to moderate-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy, topical steroid therapy (e.g., nasal, skin), long-term alternate-day treatment with low to moderate doses of short-acting systemic steroids, and intra-articular, bursal, or tendon injection of corticosteroids are not immunosuppressive in their usual doses and do not contraindicate the administration of measles vaccine. \nThe growing number of infants and preschoolers with HIV infection has directed special attention to the appropriate immunization of such children. Asymptomatic children do not need to be evaluated and tested for HIV infection before decisions concerning vaccination are made. Asymptomatic HIV-infected persons in need of MMR should receive it. MMR should be considered for all symptomatic HIV-infected children, including children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), since measles disease in these children can be severe. Limited data on MMR vaccination among both asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV-infected children indicate that MMR has not been associated with severe or unusual adverse events, although antibody responses have been unpredictable (22-24). \nThe administration of high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IGIV) at regular intervals to HIV-infected children is being studied to determine whether it will prevent a variety of infections. MMR vaccine may be ineffective if it is administered to a child who has received IGIV during the preceding 3 months. \nManagement of Patients with Contraindications to Measles Vaccine \nIf immediate protection against measles is required for persons  with contraindications to measles vaccination, passive immunization with IG, 0.25 ml\/kg (0.11 ml\/lb) of body weight (maximum dose = 15 ml), should be given as soon as possible after known exposure. Exposed symptomatic HIV-infected and other immunocompromised persons should receive IG regardless of their previous vaccination status; however, IG in usual doses may not be effective in such patients. For immunocompromised persons, the recommended dose is 0.5 ml\/kg of body weight if IG is administered intramuscularly (maximum dose = 15 ml). This corresponds to a dose of protein of approximately 82.5 mg\/kg (maximum dose = 2,475 mg). Intramuscular IG may not be needed if a patient with HIV infection is receiving 100-400 mg\/kg IGIV at regular intervals and the last dose was given within 3 weeks of exposure to measles. Because the amounts of protein administered are similar, high-dose IGIV may be as effective as IG given intramuscularly. However, no data are available concerning the effectiveness of IGIV in preventing measles. \nSimultaneous Administration of Vaccines \nIn general, simultaneous administration of the most widely used  live and inactivated vaccines does not impair antibody responses or increase rates of adverse reactions (25). The administration of MMR vaccine yields results similar to the administration of individual measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines at different sites or at different times. \nThere are equivalent antibody responses and no clinically significant increases in the frequency of adverse events when DTP, MMR, and OPV or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) are administered either simultaneously at different sites or at separate times. Routine simultaneous administration of MMR, DTP, and OPV (or IPV) is recommended for all children greater than or equal to 15 months of age who are eligible to receive these vaccines . Vaccination with MMR at 15 months followed by DTP, OPV (or IPV), and Haemophilus influenzae b conjugate vaccine (HbCV) at 18 months remains an acceptable alternative for children with caregivers known to be generally compliant with other health-care recommendations. No data are available on the concomitant administration of HbCV or H. influenzae b polysaccharide vaccine (HbPV) and OPV and MMR vaccine. If the child might not be brought back for future vaccinations, the simultaneous administration of all vaccines (including DTP, OPV, MMR, and HbCV or HbPV) is recommended, as appropriate to the recipient's age and previous vaccination status. \nOUTBREAK CONTROL \nAll reports of suspected measles cases should be investigated promptly. A measles outbreak exists in a community whenever one case of measles is confirmed. Once this occurs, preventing the dissemination of measles depends on the prompt vaccination of susceptible persons. Control activities should not be delayed for laboratory results on suspected cases. Persons who cannot readily provide documentation of measles immunity (see \"Measles Immunity\") should be vaccinated or excluded from the setting (e.g., school). Documentation of vaccination is adequate only if the date of vaccination is provided. Almost all persons who are excluded from an outbreak area because they lack documentation of immunity quickly comply with vaccination requirements. Persons who have been exempted from measles vaccination for medical, religious, or other reasons should be excluded from the outbreak area until at least 2 weeks after the onset of rash in the last case of measles. \nSchool-based Outbreaks \nDuring outbreaks in day-care centers; elementary, middle, junior, and senior high schools; and colleges and other institutions of higher education, a program of revaccination with MMR vaccine is recommended in the affected schools. Consideration should be given to revaccination in unaffected schools that may be at risk of measles transmission. Revaccination should include all students and their siblings and all school personnel born in or after 1957 who cannot provide documentation that they received two doses of measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday or other evidence of measles immunity (see \"Measles Immunity\"). Persons revaccinated, as well as unvaccinated persons receiving their first dose as part of the outbreak control program, may be immediately readmitted to school. Mass revaccination of entire communities is not necessary. \nQuarantine \nImposing quarantine measures for outbreak control is both difficult and disruptive to schools and other organizations. Under special circumstances restriction of an event might be warranted; however, such action is not recommended as a routine measure for outbreak control. \nOutbreaks Among Preschool-aged Children \nThe risk of complications from measles is high among infants less than 1 year of age. Therefore, considering the benefits and risks, vaccination with monovalent measles vaccine is recommended for infants as young as 6 months of age when exposure to natural measles is considered likely. MMR may be administered to children before the first birthday if monovalent measles vaccine is not readily available. Children vaccinated before the first birthday should be revaccinated when they are 15 months old and when they enter school to ensure adequate protection (see \"General Recommendations\"). \nMedical Settings \nIf an outbreak occurs in the areas served by a hospital or within a hospital, all employees with direct patient contact who were born in or after 1957 who cannot provide documentation they they received two doses of measles vaccine on or after their first birthday or other evidence of immunity to measles (see \"Measles Immunity\") should receive a dose of measles vaccine. Since some medical personnel who have acquired measles in medical facilities were born before 1957, vaccination of older employees who may have occupational exposure to measles should also be considered during outbreaks. Susceptible personnel who have been exposed should be relieved from direct patient contact from the fifth to the 21st day after exposure regardless of whether they received vaccine or IG after the exposure. Personnel who become ill should be relieved from patient contact for 7 days after they develop rash. \nDISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS \nDisease Surveillance \nAs the incidence of measles declines in the United States, aggressive surveillance becomes increasingly important. Effective surveillance can delineate inadequate levels of protection, define groups needing special attention, and assess the effectiveness of control activities. \nKnown or suspected measles cases should be reported immediately  to local health departments. Serologic confirmation should be attempted for every suspected case of measles that cannot be linked to a confirmed case. Reporting of suspected cases and implementation of outbreak-control activities should not be delayed pending laboratory results. \nThe traditional serologic diagnosis of measles requires a significant rise in antibody titer between acute- and convalescent-phase sera. However, the diagnosis can also be made by demonstrating the presence of IgM antibody in a single specimen. Correct interpretation of serologic data depends upon the proper timing of specimen collection in relation to rash onset. This timing is especially important for interpreting negative IgM results, since IgM antibody peaks approximately 10 days after rash onset and is usually undetectable 30 days after rash onset. \nAsymptomatic reinfection can occur in persons who have previously developed antibodies, whether from vaccination or from natural disease. Symptomatic reinfections are rare. These reinfections have been accompanied by rises in measles antibody titers. \nReporting of Adverse Events \nThe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires physicians and other health care providers who administer vaccines to maintain permanent immunization records and to report occurrences of adverse events specified in the Act (14). These adverse events, as well as other adverse events that require medical attention, must be reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Although there eventually will be one system for reporting adverse events following immunizations, two separate systems currently exist. The appropriate reporting method depends on the source of funding used to purchase the vaccine. If a vaccine was purchased with public funds, adverse events should be reported to the appropriate local, county, or state health department. The state health department submits its report to CDC. If vaccine was purchased with private money, adverse events should be reported directly to the Food and Drug Administration. \nOfficial name: Measles Virus Vaccine, Live Attenuated. ** Available in the United States as Attenuvax (single antigen),  M-R-Vax (measles-rubella) and M-M-R II (measles-mumps-rubella), from the  Merck, Sharp and Dohme Co. \nTable_1 \n Note:  To print large tables and graphs users may have to change their printer settings to landscape and use a small font size.\n Disclaimer  \u00c2\u00a0 All MMWR HTML documents published before January 1993 are electronic conversions from ASCII text into HTML.

Clemmons, MPH1, Paul A. Gastanaduy, MD1, Amy Parker Fiebelkorn, MSN1, Susan B. Redd 1, Gregory S. Wallace, MD1 (Author affiliations at end of text)\nMeasles is a highly contagious, acute viral illness that can lead to complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. As a result of high 2-dose measles vaccination coverage in the United States and improved control of measles in the World Health Organization's Region of the Americas, the United States declared measles elimination (defined as interruption of year-round endemic transmission) in 2000 (1). Importations from other countries where measles remains endemic continue to occur, however, which can lead to clusters of measles cases in the United States. To update surveillance data on current measles outbreaks, CDC analyzed cases reported during January 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201cApril 2, 2015. A total of 159 cases were reported during this period. Over 80% of the cases occurred among persons who were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Four outbreaks have occurred, with one accounting for 70% of all measles cases this year. The continued risk for importation of measles into the United States and occurrence of measles cases and outbreaks in communities with high proportions of unvaccinated persons highlight the need for sustained, high vaccination coverage across the country.\nConfirmed measles cases in the United States are reported by state and local health departments to CDC using a standard case definition (2). A measles case is considered confirmed if it is laboratory-confirmed or meets the clinical case definition (an illness characterized by a generalized rash lasting \u00e2\u2030\u00a53 days, a temperature of \u00e2\u2030\u00a5101\u00c2\u00b0F [\u00e2\u2030\u00a538.3\u00c2\u00b0C], and cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis) and is linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case. Measles cases are laboratory confirmed if there is detection in serum of measles-specific immunoglobulin M, isolation of measles virus, or detection of measles virus nucleic acid from a clinical specimen. Cases are considered imported if at least some of the exposure period (7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 days before rash onset) occurred outside the United States and rash occurred within 21 days of entry into the United States, with no known exposure to measles in the United States during that period. Import-associated cases include 1) imported cases, 2) cases that are linked epidemiologically to imported cases, and 3) cases for which an epidemiologic link has not been identified but the viral genotype detected suggests recent importation.* An outbreak of measles is defined as a chain of transmission of three or more linked cases.\nDuring January 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201cApril 2, 2015, a total of 159 measles cases (in 155 U.S. residents and four foreign visitors) from 18 states and the District of Columbia were reported to CDC (Figure 1). Patients ranged in age from 6 weeks to 70 years; 26 (16%) were aged <12 months, 18 (12%) were aged 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 years, 27 (17%) were aged 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c19 years, 58 (36%) were aged 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c39 years, and 30 (19%) were aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a540 years. Twenty-two patients (14%) were hospitalized, including five with pneumonia. No other complications and no deaths have been reported.\nA total of 111 cases (70%) have been associated with an outbreak that originated in late December 2014 in Disney theme parks in Orange County, California. The source of the initial exposure has not been identified, but measles cases associated with this outbreak have been reported in seven U.S. states, Mexico, and Canada (3). Measles was laboratory confirmed in 101 (91%) of these cases, either by detection of measles-specific IgM or of measles virus RNA. The B3 genotype was identified in specimens from at least 40 patients associated with this outbreak. B3 is a common measles genotype that has been identified in multiple states and countries (4). Other smaller measles outbreaks in 2015 without a link to Disney theme parks have been reported in Illinois (15 cases), Nevada (nine), and Washington (five).\nThe majority of the 159 patients with reported measles in the 2015 outbreaks were either unvaccinated (71 [45%]) or had unknown vaccination status (60 [38%]); 28 (18%) had received measles vaccine. Among the 68 U.S. residents who had measles and were unvaccinated, 29 (43%) cited philosophical or religious objections to vaccination, 27 (40%) were ineligible because they were too young to receive vaccination (26 patients) or had a medical contraindication (one), three (4%) represented missed opportunities for vaccination, and nine (13%) had other reasons for not being vaccinated (Figure 2).\nOf the 159 measles cases, 153 (96%) were import-associated. Ten cases were classified as direct importations, (six among unvaccinated U.S. residents returning from overseas travel, of whom three were aged 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c11 months and age-eligible for vaccination before departure, and four among foreign visitors). Countries associated with direct importations included Azerbaijan, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Qatar, Singapore, and United Arab Emirates (one import each).\nHigh population immunity secondary to high measles vaccination coverage has maintained measles elimination in the United States since declaration of elimination in 2000 (5). Worldwide, however, approximately 20 million measles cases occur annually, and importations to the U.S. will continue to place unvaccinated populations at risk for measles. Measles transmission in pockets of unvaccinated persons increases the risk for transmission to vulnerable groups, such as those who cannot be vaccinated because of underlying medical conditions, or infants too young to be vaccinated.\nAs in previous years, a sizeable proportion of U.S. residents who became infected with measles had an unknown vaccination status (6). This occurred primarily among adults and reflects the lack of immunization data in registries on adults in the United States. Among the U.S.-resident patients who were confirmed as unvaccinated, the numbers who were ineligible for vaccination and who cited philosophical or religious beliefs as the reason they declined vaccination were similar. Exemptions from mandated immunizations have been shown to increase risk for acquiring disease as well as increasing the risk of a disease outbreak at the community level. Exemption rates are higher in jurisdictions where exemption requirements are procedurally easier to meet (7).\u00e2\u20ac\u00a0\nHealth care providers should encourage vaccination of all eligible patients who do not have other evidence of measles immunity. Children without contraindications should receive their first dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine at age 12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 months and a second dose at age 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 years. Before international travel, infants aged 6-11 months should receive one dose of MMR and children aged 12 months and older should receive two doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days. Adults born during or after 1957 who are at high risk for measles (i.e., health care personnel, international travelers, and students at postsecondary educational institutions) and who do not have other evidence of measles immunity should also receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Other adults without evidence of measles immunity should receive at least 1 dose of MMR vaccine. 1 dose of MMR vaccine administered to those aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a512 months is approximately 93% effective at preventing measles and 2 doses approximately 97% effective (8).\nMeasles should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with febrile illness and rash. Patients with clinical symptoms compatible with measles should be asked about recent travel abroad or contact with travelers, and their vaccination status should be verified. Patients with suspected measles should be promptly screened before entering waiting rooms and appropriately isolated (i.e., in an airborne isolation room or, if not available, in a separate room with the door closed), or have their doctor's office appointments scheduled at the end of the day to prevent exposure of other patients (9). Serology as well as viral specimens should be collected for laboratory testing. Viral genetic sequencing can be used to detect the genotype of the infection, which can be used to suggest the source of an imported virus and track global transmission patterns (10). To assist state and local public health departments with rapid investigation and control efforts to limit the spread of disease, suspected measles cases should be reported to local health departments immediately. State health departments are required to notify cases of measles to CDC within 24 hours of detection.\u00c2\u00a7\nMaintenance of high 2-dose MMR vaccine coverage has been crucial in limiting measles spread from importations in the United States. Most measles importations occur when U.S. citizens travel abroad and have not been appropriately vaccinated. Therefore, it is important to encourage timely delivery of measles vaccination for U.S. residents before overseas travel. In addition, early detection of cases and rapid public health response to outbreaks can serve to limit the spread of illness.\nWilliam Bellini, PhD, Paul Rota, PhD, Jennifer Rota, MPH, Division of Viral Diseases; Melinda Wharton, MD, Immunization Services Division; Kristin Pope, MEd; Office of Policy, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC.\n\t1Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, CDC (Corresponding author: Nakia Clemmons, nclemmons@cdc.gov, 404.639.2553)\n","22":"Hepatitis B vaccine has been successfully integrated into the childhood vaccination schedule, contributing to a 96% decline in the incidence of acute Hepatitis B in children and adolescents. Currently, approximately 95% of new HBV infections occur among adults, and unvaccinated adults with behavioral risk factors or who are household contacts or sex partners of HBV-infected persons remain at risk.\nAn estimated 80%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c95% of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are diagnosed in medical settings other than STD clinics. Therefore, primary care and specialty medical care providers should provide Hepatitis B vaccination whenever indicated or requested as part of regular preventive care.\nIn primary care and specialty medical settings, including physician\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offices, family planning clinics, community health centers, liver disease clinics, and travel clinics, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that providers implement standing orders to identify adults recommended for Hepatitis B vaccination and administer vaccination as part of routine services.\nHepatitis B Vaccination Recommendations for Adults\nRecommended doses of Hepatitis B vaccines (by age group and vaccine type)\nUse of Standing Orders Programs to Increase Adult Vaccination Rates: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \n MMWR 2000;49(RR-1):15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c26\nStanding Orders for Administering Hepatitis B Vaccine to Adults [PDF - 1 page]\nCoding Guidelines for Vaccine Preventable Hepatitis [PDF - 2 pages] \n Brochure from the American Medical Association that provides CPT and ICD coding guidelines for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B in high-risk populations\nMerck Vaccine Reimbursement Support Center \n Service to assist physicians in filing for reimbursement for Merck vaccines and their administration\nMerck Vaccine Patient Assistance Program \n Provides vaccines free of charge to eligible adults, primarily the uninsured\nAdults Only Vaccination: A Step-by-Step Guide (2004)\n Guide from the Immunization Action Coalition to help integrate immunization services into health care settings new to vaccination\nTravelers' Health\nVaccines and Immunizations\n","23":"Vaccination records (sometimes called immunization records) provide a history of all the vaccines you or your child received. This record may be required for certain jobs, travel abroad, or school registration.\n","24":"Mumps is a contagious disease that is caused by a virus. Mumps typically starts with fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Then, most people will have swelling of their salivary glands. This is what causes the puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw.\nMumps can be prevented with MMR vaccine. This protects against three diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella. CDC recommends children get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Teens and adults also should also be up to date on their MMR vaccination.\nMMR vaccine is very safe and effective. The mumps component of the MMR vaccine is about 88% (range: 66-95%) effective when a person gets two doses; one dose is about 78% (range: 49%\u00e2\u02c6\u201992%) effective.\nChildren may also get MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox). This vaccine is only licensed for use in children who are 12 months through 12 years of age.\nBefore the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, mumps was a universal disease of childhood. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Mumps outbreaks can still occur in highly vaccinated U.S. communities, particularly in close-contact settings such as schools, colleges, and camps. However, high vaccination coverage helps to limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks.\n","25":"Chickenpox, or varicella, is a very contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. It spreads easily from infected people to others who have never had chickenpox or never received the chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox virus spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters.\nYou can protect against chickenpox with safe, effective vaccination.\nThe chickenpox vaccine is very safe, and it is effective at preventing chickenpox. Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it. The vaccine is usually given in two doses.\u00c2\u00a0 Side effects are more likely after the first dose than after the second.\nSerious side effects after the chickenpox vaccine are extremely rare. The few that have been reported after vaccination include severe rash, infections of the lungs or liver, meningitis, seizures, pneumonia, or general severe infection with the virus strain from the vaccine. Some children who had these serious side effects after vaccination had weakened immune systems before they were vaccinated, but they had not been diagnosed by a doctor at the time of vaccination.\nPeople who get chickenpox vaccines can spread the vaccine-strain varicella-zoster-virus to others. However, this happens very rarely.\nPregnant women, people who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled, and people allergic to any vaccine component should not get chickenpox vaccine. For more information, see Contraindications and Precautions for Varicella Vaccination.\n\u00c2\u00a0Top of Page\nThere are two chickenpox vaccines approved for use in the United States, one of which is combined with vaccines for other diseases:\nVarivax: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this vaccine in 1995 for use in people 1 year of age and older.\nProQuad [PDF -425 KB]: FDA approved this vaccine in 2005 for use in children ages 1 through 12 years of age.

The most commonly reported side effects after vaccination are soreness or swelling where the shot was given, fever, and mild rash.\u00c2\u00a0 Very rare side effects include seizures and pneumonia. \nBefore the FDA licensed the vaccine, studies were done to determine the safety of 2 doses of the vaccine. In children 12 months through 12 years old: \n1 of 5 children had side effects, such as soreness, swelling, and redness, within 3 days of getting the first dose compared with 1 of 4 children after the second dose\nIn 2008, a CDC-FDA report analyzed VAERS data on patients who reported side effects after getting chickenpox vaccine during May 1995 through December 2005. The vaccine manufacturer Merck distributed 50 million doses of chickenpox vaccine during this time. The report found that the vast majority of people had no or very mild side effects, such as rash and soreness, with the vaccine. Serious side effects linked to the vaccine were extremely rare.\nRarely, serious adverse events after chickenpox vaccination have been reported. These include thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), acute cerebellar ataxia (brain injury that leads to balance problems), and acute hemiparesis (paralysis on part the body). It is not known if these side effects were caused by the vaccine. Lab testing was either not done or did not confirm if the problems were caused by vaccine.\nAlthough pregnant women should not get the chickenpox vaccine, there are women who may get the vaccine by mistake. In 1995, Merck, Inc., in collaboration with CDC, established a Pregnancy Registry to monitor the fetal and pregnancy outcomes of women who inadvertently received chickenpox vaccine 3 months before or at any time during pregnancy. After 17 years of monitoring, no cases of congenital chickenpox syndrome or increased risk for other birth defects have been identified.\n\u00c2\u00a0Top of Page\nChickenpox Vaccine: Who Should Not Get Vaccinated\nMeasles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella (MMRV) Vaccine Safety\nChickenpox Vaccination: What Everyone Should Know\nInformation for Parents: Chickenpox and the Vaccine (Shot) to Prevent It\nChickenpox Fact Sheet [PDF \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 300 KB]\nInformation for Healthcare Providers: Varicella Vaccination\nCDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chickenpox \u00c2\u00a0Disease Website\n\u00c2\u00a0Top of Page\nChaves SS, Haber P, Walton K, Wise RP, Izurieta HS, et al.

Complications can include ear infection, diarrhea, pneumonia, brain damage, and death.\nMumps causes fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen salivary glands. Complications can include swelling of the testicles or ovaries, deafness, inflammation of the brain and\/or tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (encephalitis\/meningitis) and, rarely, death.\nRubella, causes fever, sore throat, rash, headache, and red, itchy eyes. If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects.\nYou can protect against these diseases with safe, effective vaccination.\nThe MMR vaccine is very safe, and it is effective at preventing measles, mumps, and rubella. Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it. Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps or rubella.\nMMR vaccine has been linked with a very small risk of febrile seizures (seizures or jerking caused by fever). \u00c2\u00a0Febrile seizures following MMR are rare and are not associated with any long-term effects. Because the risk of febrile seizures increases as infants get older, it is recommended that they get vaccinated as soon as recommended.\nSome people may experience swelling in the cheeks or neck. MMR vaccine rarely causes a temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder that usually goes away without treatment and is not life threatening.\nExtremely rarely, a person may have a serious allergic reaction to MMR vaccine. \u00c2\u00a0Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine.\n\u00c2\u00a0Top of Page\nThere is one MMR vaccine approved for use in the United States.\nM-M-R II [PDF \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 94 KB]: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this vaccine in 1971 for use in people 12 months of age and older.\nThe measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine also protects against these diseases.\n\u00c2\u00a0Top of Page\nCDC and FDA continuously monitor the safety of vaccines after they are approved.\u00c2\u00a0 If a problem is found with a vaccine, CDC and FDA will inform health officials, health care providers, and the public.\nCDC uses three systems to monitor vaccine safety:\nThe Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): an early warning system that helps CDC and FDA monitor problems following vaccination.\u00c2\u00a0 Anyone can report possible vaccine side effects to VAERS.\nThe Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD): a collaboration between CDC and nine health care organizations which allows ongoing monitoring and proactive searches of vaccine-related data.\nThe Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project: a partnership between CDC and several medical centers that conducts clinical research on vaccine-associated health risks.\n\u00c2\u00a0Top of Page\nTwo recent studies (Rowhani-Rahbar et al, 2013; Klein et al, 2010) indicate that for every 10,000 children who get their first MMR and varicella vaccines as separate shots when they are 12-23 months old, about four will have a febrile seizure during the 7-10 days following vaccination. Children of the same age who get the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine as their first vaccine against these diseases are twice as likely to have a febrile seizure during the same time period.\nStudies have shown that for children younger than 7 years old, there is a very small increased risk of febrile seizures approximately 6 to 14 days after MMR vaccination; this happens in about 1 in 3,000 to 4,000 children.\nJoint pain is associated with the rubella portion of MMR vaccine among people who do not have immunity to rubella. Joint pain and temporary arthritis happen more often after MMR vaccination in adults than in children. Women also experience this reaction more often than men. Joint pain or stiffness occurs in up to 1 in 4 of females past puberty who were not previously immune to rubella; their symptoms generally begin 1 to 3 weeks after vaccination, are usually mild and last about 2 days. These symptoms rarely come back.\nImmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a disorder that decreases the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to stop bleeding. It can happen after both natural measles infection as well as after getting the MMR vaccine. However, it is usually not life threating. Treatment may include blood transfusion and medications. The risk of ITP has been shown to be increased in the six weeks following an MMR vaccination, with one study estimating 1 case per 40,000 vaccinated children.\nMeasles inclusion body encephalitis, or severe brain swelling caused by the measles virus, is a complication of getting infected with the wild-type measles virus.\u00c2\u00a0 While rare, this disorder almost always happens in patients with weakened immune systems. The illness usually develops within 1 year after initial measles infection and has a high death rate. There have been three published reports of this complication happening to vaccinated people. In these cases, encephalitis developed between 4 and 9 months after MMR vaccination. In one case, the measles vaccine strain was identified as the cause.\nSome parents might worry that the vaccine causes autism. Signs of autism typically appear around the same time that children are recommended to receive the MMR vaccine. Vaccine safety experts, including experts at CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), agree that MMR vaccine is not responsible for increases in the number of children with autism.

It is caused by a virus.\nRabies is mainly a disease of animals. Humans get rabies when they are bitten by infected animals.\nAt first there might not be any symptoms. But weeks, or even months after a bite, rabies can cause pain, fatigue, headaches, fever, and irritability. These are followed by seizures, hallucinations, and paralysis. Human rabies is almost always fatal.\nWild animals - especially bats - are the most common source of human rabies infection in the United States.\nSkunks, raccoons, dogs, cats, coyotes, foxes and other mammals can also transmit the disease.\nHuman rabies is rare in the United States. There have been only 55 cases diagnosed since 1990.\nHowever, between 16,000 and 39,000 people are vaccinated each year as a precaution after animal bites. Also, rabies is far more common in other parts of the world, with about 40,000 - 70,000 rabies-related deaths worldwide each year. Bites from unvaccinated dogs cause most of these cases.\nTop of Page\nRabies vaccine is given to people at high risk of rabies to protect them if they are exposed. It can also prevent the disease if it is given to a person after they have been exposed.\nRabies vaccine is made from killed rabies virus. It cannot cause rabies.\nTop of Page\nPeople at high risk of exposure to rabies, such as veterinarians, animal handlers, rabies laboratory workers, spelunkers, and rabies biologics production workers should be offered rabies vaccine.\nThe pre-exposure schedule for rabies vaccination is 3 doses, given at the following times:\nDose 1: As appropriate\nDose 2: 7 days after Dose 1\nDose 3: 21 days or 28 days after Dose 1\nFor laboratory workers and others who may be repeatedly exposed to rabies virus, periodic testing for immunity is recommended, and booster doses should be given as needed. (Testing or booster doses are not recommended for travelers.) Ask your doctor for details.\nAnyone who has been bitten by an animal, or who otherwise may have been exposed to rabies, should clean the wound and see a doctor immediately. The doctor will determine if they need to be vaccinated.\nA person who is exposed and has never been vaccinated against rabies should get 4 doses of rabies vaccine - one dose right away, and additional doses on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th days. They should also get another shot called Rabies Immune Globulin at the same time as the first dose.\nA person who has been previously vaccinated should get 2 doses of rabies vaccine - one right away and another on the 3rd day. Rabies Immune Globulin is not needed.\nTop of Page\nTalk with a doctor before getting rabies vaccine if you:\never had a serious (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a previous dose of rabies vaccine, or to any component of the vaccine; tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies,\nIf you have a minor illnesses, such as a cold, you can be vaccinated. If you are moderately or severely ill, you should probably wait until you recover before getting a routine (non-exposure) dose of rabies vaccine.\nIf you have been exposed to rabies virus, you should get the vaccine regardless of any other illnesses you may have.\nTop of Page\nA vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Serious problems from rabies vaccine are very rare.\nMild problems\nModerate problems\nOther nervous system disorders, such as Guillain Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome (GBS), have been reported after rabies vaccine, but this happens so rarely that it is not known whether they are related to the vaccine.\nNOTE: Several brands of rabies vaccine are available in the United States, and reactions may vary between brands. Your provider can give you more information about a particular brand.\nTop of Page\nWhat should I look for?\nLook for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.\nSigns of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.\nWhat should I do?\nIf you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital.

It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Measles starts with fever. Soon after, it causes a cough, runny nose, and red eyes. Then a rash of tiny, red spots breaks out. It starts at the head and spreads to the rest of the body.\nMeasles can be prevented with MMR vaccine. The vaccine protects against three diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella. CDC recommends children get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Teens and adults should also be up to date on their MMR vaccination.\nThe MMR vaccine is very safe and effective. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective.\nChildren may also get MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox). This vaccine is only licensed for use in children who are 12 months through 12 years of age.\nBefore the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3 to 4 million people got measles each year in the United States. Of these, approximately 500,000 cases were reported each year to CDC; of these, 400 to 500 died, 48,000 were hospitalized, and 1,000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling) from measles. Since then, widespread use of measles vaccine has led to a greater than 99% reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era. However, measles is still common in other countries. Unvaccinated people continue to get measles while abroad and bring the disease into the United States and spread it to others.\n","30":"Current Edition Date: 4\/20\/2012\nMeasles, mumps, and rubella are serious diseases.

People with ASD may communicate, interact, behave, and learn in different ways. Recent estimates from\u00c2\u00a0CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network found that about 1 in 68 children have been identified with ASD in communities across the United States. CDC is committed to providing essential data on ASD, searching for causes of and factors that increase the risk for ASD, and developing resources that help identify children with ASD as early as possible.\nSome people have had concerns that ASD might be linked to the vaccines children receive, but studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing ASD. In 2011, an Institute of Medicine (IOM)\u00c2\u00a0report on eight vaccines given to children and adults found that with rare exceptions, these vaccines are very safe.\nA\u00c2\u00a02013 CDC study [PDF \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 204 KB] added to the research showing that vaccines do not cause ASD. The study looked at the number of antigens (substances in vaccines that cause the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system to produce disease-fighting antibodies) from vaccines during the first two years of life. The results showed that the total amount of antigen from vaccines received was the same between children with ASD and those that did not have ASD.\nOne vaccine ingredient that has been studied specifically is thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used to prevent contamination of multidose vials of vaccines. Research shows that thimerosal does not cause ASD. In fact, a 2004\u00c2\u00a0scientific review by the IOM concluded that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccontaining vaccines and autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Since 2003, there have been\u00c2\u00a0nine CDC-funded or conducted studies [PDF \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 357 KB] that have found no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD, as well as no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and ASD in children.\nBetween 1999 and 2001, thimerosal was removed or reduced to trace amounts in all childhood vaccines except for some flu vaccines. This was done as part of a broader national effort to reduce all types of mercury exposure in children before studies were conducted that determined that thimerosal was not harmful. It was done as a precaution. Currently, the only childhood vaccines that contain thimerosal are flu vaccines packaged in multidose vials. Thimerosal-free alternatives are also available for flu vaccine. For more information, see the Timeline for Thimerosal in Vaccines.\nBesides thimerosal, some people have had concerns about other\u00c2\u00a0vaccine ingredients in relation to ASD as well.

Vaccines reduce the risk of infection by working with the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural defenses to help it safely develop immunity to disease.\nWhen germs, such as bacteria or viruses, invade the body, they attack and multiply. This invasion is called an infection, and the infection is what causes illness. The immune system then has to fight the infection. Once it fights off the infection, the body is left with a supply of cells that help recognize and fight that disease in the future.\nVaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection, but this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imitation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd infection does not cause illness. It does, however, cause the immune system to develop the same response as it does to a real infection so the body can recognize and fight the vaccine-preventable disease in the future. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection can cause minor symptoms, such as fever. Such minor symptoms are normal and should be expected as the body builds immunity.\nAs children get older, they require additional doses of some vaccines for best protection. Older kids also need to be protected against additional diseases they may encounter. Learn more about vaccines for your pre-teens and teens.\nRead more about how vaccines work [2 pages].\nLearn about diseases and the vaccines that prevent them, including the most common side effects associated with each one.\nAs a parent, you may get upset or concerned when you watch your baby get 3 or 4 shots during a doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit. But, all of those shots add up to your baby being protected against 14 infectious diseases. Young babies can get very ill from vaccine-preventable diseases. The vaccination schedule is designed to protect young children before they are likely to be exposed to potentially serious diseases and when they are most vulnerable to serious infections.\nAlthough children continue to get several vaccines up to their second birthday, these vaccines do not overload the immune system. Every day, your healthy baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system successfully fights off thousands of antigens-the parts of germs that cause the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system to respond. The antigens in vaccines come from weakened or killed germs so they cannot cause serious illness. Vaccines contain only a tiny amount of the antigens that your baby encounters every day, even if your child receives several vaccines in one day.\nCombination vaccines take two or more vaccines that could be given individually and put them into one shot. Children get the same protection as they do from individual vaccines given separately\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut with fewer shots. Learn more about combination vaccines [2 pages].\nLike any medication, vaccines, can cause side effects. The most common side effects are mild. On the other hand, many vaccine-preventable disease symptoms can be serious, or even deadly. Even though many of these diseases are rare in this country, they still occur around the world and can be brought into the U.S., putting unvaccinated children at risk.\nThe side effects associated with getting vaccines are almost always minor (such as redness and swelling where the shot was given) and go away within a few days. If your child experiences a reaction at the injection site, you can use a cool, wet cloth to reduce redness, soreness, and swelling.\nSerious side effects following vaccination, such as severe allergic reaction, are very rare and doctors and clinic staff are trained to deal with them. Pay extra attention to your child for a few days after vaccination. If you see something that concerns you, call your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doctor.\nLearn about diseases and the vaccines that prevent them, including the most common side effects associated with each one.\nLearn how to soothe your child before, during, and after vaccination with these tips for your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccine visit.\nLearn about who should not get vaccinated with certain vaccines.\nUnderstand the risks if you decide not to vaccinate your children.\nLearn about MMR vaccine safety [2 pages].\nVaccines contain ingredients, called antigens, which cause the body to develop immunity. Vaccines also contain very small amounts of other ingredients\u00e2\u20ac\u201call of which play necessary roles either in making the vaccine, or in ensuring that the vaccine is safe and effective. These types of ingredients are listed below.\n*Today, the only childhood vaccines used routinely in the United States that contain thimerosal (mercury) are flu vaccines in multi-dose vials. These vials have very tiny amounts of thimerosal as a preservative. This is necessary because each time an individual dose is drawn from a multi-dose vial with a new needle and syringe, there is the potential to contaminate the vial with harmful microbes (toxins). Learn more about thimerosal, mercury, and vaccine safety [2 pages].\nThere is no evidence that the small amounts of thimerosal in flu vaccines causes any harm, except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. Although no evidence suggests that there are safety concerns with thimerosal, vaccine manufacturers have stopped using it as a precautionary measure. Flu vaccines that do not contain thimerosal are available (in single dose vials).\nThe United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 long-standing vaccine safety system ensures that vaccines are as safe as possible. In fact, currently, the United States has the safest vaccine supply in its history.\nSafety monitoring begins with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who ensures the safety, effectiveness, and availability of vaccines for the United States. Before a vaccine is approved by the FDA for use by the public, results of studies on safety and effectiveness of the vaccine are evaluated by highly trained FDA scientists and doctors. FDA also inspects the sites where vaccines are made to make sure they follow strict manufacturing guidelines.\nAlthough most common side effects of a vaccine are identified in studies before the vaccine is licensed, rare adverse events may not be detected in these studies. Therefore, the U.S. vaccine safety system continuously monitors for possible side effects after a vaccine is licensed. When millions of people receive a vaccine, less common side effects that were not identified earlier may occur.\nIf a link is found between a possible side effect and a vaccine, public health officials take appropriate action. They will weigh the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change. Learn more about the U.S. vaccine safety system [2 pages].\nThe Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national system used by scientists at FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to collect reports of adverse events (possible side effects) that happen after vaccination.

I cannot possibly state strongly enough how dangerous it is that President-elect Donald Trump has embraced the notion that vaccination is the cause of autism.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a celebrated vaccine skeptic, met with Trump on Jan. 10. Speaking to reporters outside Trump Tower in Manhattan after the meeting, Kennedy said he will chair a commission \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on vaccine safety and scientific integrity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request, because, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we ought to be debating the science.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n(One news organization, the Guardian, later reported that the Trump team denies Kennedy will lead such a commission, but offered no explanation for why the environmentalist was summoned to meet with the president-elect.)\nKennedy has long held the position that vaccines are dangerous, and that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine administered to American children is a likely cause of autism. Like any good conspiracy theorist, Trump has long questioned the wisdom of vaccines. On Oct. 22, 2012, he tweeted that vaccines constitute \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doctor-inflicted autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIn August 2016, Trump met with the disgraced ex-physician, Andrew Wakefield, who originated the claim. Formerly a gastroenterologist, Wakefield conducted experiments on children that he claimed proved they acquired autism from MMR immunization. The research was published in the British medical journal Lancet in 1998 but was retracted in 2010 by the journal, which stated: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 claims in the original paper \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 have been proven to be false. Therefore we fully retract this paper from the published record.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nWakefield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license to practice medicine in the United Kingdom was stripped for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious misconduct.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The British Medical Jjournal went even further, denouncing Wakefield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fraudulent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Before the investigation was completed, Wakefield relocated to Austin, Texas, where he continues to lead vaccine opposition.\nWakefield produced a documentary, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaxxed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in which he defends his work and claims to be the victim of a vast conspiracy. His defenders adhere to the conspiracy idea, insisting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the entire global vaccine industry, the World Health Organization, the National Institutes of Health, the pharmaceutical industry, and all the major science and medical journals in the world are joined in the mission of inflicting autism through vaccines.\nSo let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get a few things straight.\nYes, there has been an increase in autism diagnoses in parts of Europe, the United States and Canada \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but this is largely because psychiatric associations have widened the definition of the disorder, now describing autism as a spectrum that ranges from the extreme of complete nonfunctionality all the way to socially challenged genius, or Asperger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s syndrome. Some additional rise in rates may not be fully explained by the expanded diagnostic definition: It is likely that parent and physician awareness, coupled with lowered stigma, has brought more cases to light. Boys are at least five times more likely to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder than girls, yet the genders are equally likely to be vaccinated.\nMr. Trump, back in the day when you and I were children and were vaccinated \u00e2\u20ac\u201d thankfully \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to prevent us from getting measles, rubella, polio, diphtheria, tetanus and other awful diseases, a mercury-based preservative was used to keep vaccines from going bad on doctors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shelves. Kennedy claims the mercury is still used as a preservative and causes brain damage. But the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Food and Drug Administration removed thimerosal, the preservative in question, from vaccines and it has not been used in MMR since 1999.\u00c2\u00a0\nGiven Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest in Russia, he might be interested to know that the first claims of an association among vaccines, mercury and child neurological health problems were raised in the early 1980s by Soviet virologist Galena Petrovna Chervonskaya and trumpeted in the Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda. Vaccination rates fell so low following the report that Soviet soldiers returning from war in Afghanistan, where diphtheria was still common, unwittingly spawned an epidemic that swept the Soviet Union, causing the worst outbreak since World War II. Some 200,000 unvaccinated children contracted diphtheria, which killed roughly 2 to 3 percent of those infected, varying by region.\nVaccines save lives. Back in 1970, when measles was the No. 1 cause of death for African children under 5, most of the continent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nations had child mortality rates around 400 per 1,000 live births, meaning nearly half the toddlers wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t survive to celebrate their fifth birthday. I bitterly recall walking through pediatric wards in northern Tanzania in 1983, filled to capacity with tiny children covered in measles rash, fighting for their lives.\nToday that horror has plummeted, thanks to UNICEF, GAVI, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, WHO and hundreds of nongovernmental organizations around the world that have brought the power of immunization to the poorest and most remote parts of the planet. And, if worldwide contributions to vaccine efforts stay on course, the combined impact of all immunizations from 2011 to 2020 will be 23.3 million lives saved, most of them babies.\nTrump should know that the most virulent anti-vaccine force on Earth is the Taliban, which has executed, bombed, kidnapped and maimed about 10 times more polio vaccinators in Pakistan and Afghanistan since 2005 than there are children who have contracted polio. In Nigeria, Boko Haram has blocked immunizers and spawned outbreaks of polio and measles. Thanks to the Syrian war and massive disruptions of family lives across the Middle East, polio has returned, measles has erupted, and millions of dollars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of special vaccination campaigns are underway in refugee camps and war-torn parts of Syria and Yemen.\nPerhaps these lives in far-off places aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concern: As he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said, American lives come first. But consider that, as of Jan. 10, the Arkansas Department of Health is tracking 2,421 cases of children with mumps, arising from parental refusal to vaccinate, and is telling parents that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MMR vaccine is safe and effective.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mumps outbreaks are cropping up all over the USA, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Measles caseloads are also increasing, and more than half are linked to parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 refusal to vaccinate. Whooping cough, or pertussis, is soaring across America \u00e2\u20ac\u201d another disease prevented with proper vaccination.\nVaccine-refusal rates are highest in American communities of wealth, such as Marin County, Calif. Those school districts are most likely to have elected boards of education that offer families opportunities to opt out of immunization, while still enrolling their youngsters to sit with other children in the classroom. For their children, the logic holds, raised in clean environs on healthy diets and fresh air, those bacteria and viruses pose no risk. They have the luxury of focusing on unproven challenges posed by vaccination, either due to the products\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 alleged contamination or to their babies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 inability to tolerate so many immunizing doses in such a narrow time window. Trump appears to share these views.\nThey are, of course, wrong. Unimmunized children are already growing up, going to college, and falling victim to whooping cough, measles, mumps and other microbes lurking in dormitories, gyms and elsewhere. When these kids take their well-financed school-year abroad, lack of full immunization will put them at risk for infections. And as for the pacing of the immunization schedule, I can only ask parents whether they have spent any time watching their infants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 behaviors. In a single day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s play crawling on the floor, chewing on Fido\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tail, stuffing toys shared with other toddlers into their mouths, fighting over food with siblings, or licking the cat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s milk dish, they are bringing their environs into their bodies, exposing their immune systems to doses of antigens millions of times larger than are contained in all of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recommended vaccine doses combined.\nBabies have two jobs: 1) Absorb noise, sights, and smells to program their brains and learn language. 2) Slobber over everything in sight to train their immune systems to recognize the difference between what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OK and what constitutes danger. Failure to properly build up immune defenses can lead either to an inability to fight off even mild infections or the reverse \u00e2\u20ac\u201d allergies and asthmatic responses to routine elements of life. All vaccines do is help nudge that immune system programming along.\nI was vaccinated. No doubt you were vaccinated. And we are all better for it. As soon as it was available, I lined up for the hepatitis B vaccine. I wish the chickenpox vaccine had existed when I was a baby, so I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have nearly died of the disease as an infant and suffered a horribly painful bout of shingles when I was 30.\nTaking any steps that lend credence to the anti-vaxers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conspiratorial fears will only prompt more parents to resist giving their children the same lifesaving treatments as were given to them, decades ago. Shame on anybody who would dream of putting children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives at risk, all over the world, for the sake of political expediency or the fears of rich white people.\nLaurie Garrett is senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer.\n","37":"Download or view this article as a .pdf file\nThis is the data the drug industry do not want you to see.

And as there is insufficient clinical benefit to children to introduce mass mumps vaccination, it cannot be justified as a general public health measure. \nAnd one consequence of this unnecessary measure is that we are now putting young male adults at risk of orchitis and sterility because they did not catch natural mumps harmlessly when children and because MMR vaccination is not effective in conferring full or lasting immunity across an entire population. \nOne effect of MMR vaccination has been to push mumps outbreaks into older age groups.\u00c2\u00a0 Mumps now circulates in colleges and universities: Mumps and the UK epidemic 2005, R K Gupta, J Best, E MacMahon BMJ\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a02005;330:1132-1135\u00c2\u00a0(14\u00c2\u00a0May).\n1 in 4 males who has achieved puberty and has not achieved immunity to mumps runs the risk of orchitis.\u00c2\u00a0 Orchitis (usually unilateral) has been reported as a complication in 20-30% of clinical mumps cases in postpubertal males. Some testicular atrophy occurs in about 35% of cases of mumps orchitis: Mumps \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Emedicine. This means one of the male testicles shrivels up.\u00c2\u00a0 Affected men can become sterile in one testicle.\u00c2\u00a0 This affects one in every nine males who catch mumps after puberty compared with none who catch it before puberty.\u00c2\u00a0 It is only because most men have two testicles and only one is affected that total sterility is rare.\u00c2\u00a0 Most men would find that little consolation.\u00c2\u00a0 Having a shrivelled testicle would carry psychological and practical consequences for any intimate physical relationship in adult life.\u00c2\u00a0 The message seems to be it is better for a child to catch mumps naturally before puberty.\nAs with mumps, rubella vaccination again takes the medical profession into the territory of the criminal law and unethical treatment of children. A graph for rubella mortality is not included because death from rubella over the last century was so rare the figures are insufficient to plot a graph of any note. \nAside from a rash the adverse effects of rubella for children are minimal.\u00c2\u00a0 Vaccination against rubella is of no clinical benefit to a child particularly when compared to the risks of adverse vaccine reactions.  If a pregnant woman catches rubella infection during the first three months of pregnancy and the child survives, this poses a risk to the unborn child of being born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), involving multiple congenital abnormalities.\nPrior to the introduction of rubella vaccine, the number of annual cases in the UK was small, around 50 per annum.\u00c2\u00a0 Additionally,  92% of rubella cases deliver normal healthy children:  DANISH MEDICAL BULLETIN MARCH 1987 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c WAVES Vol. 11 No. 4 p. 21 . This small risk can also be reduced either by making sure all women have caught rubella as children or by vaccinating those who have not prior to puberty.\u00c2\u00a0 This minimises the exposure of children to the vaccine and hence to unnecessary risks of adverse vaccine reactions.\nIn comparison birth defects from any other cause are much higher:\nTo see how egregious is the exaggeration of risk from rubella in order to scare parents into vaccinating their children, see the following:- \nDoes paying for healthcare bring you better health and a longer life?\u00c2\u00a0 No.\u00c2\u00a0 The following graphs show that in 1996, average life expectancy in the US was 18th of all countries, being 5 years less than Canada and behind the UK.\u00c2\u00a0 But Americans were paying per person US$1000 or over 1\/3rd more than Canadians and nearly 2\/3rds more than the British.\u00c2\u00a0 And if you then take a look at the graphs of mortality, what were Americans getting for their money?\u00c2\u00a0 Mortality rates were falling anyway, regardless and kept on falling.\u00c2\u00a0 Life expectancy increased as time went by, but again substantially due to overall improved living conditions.\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\nThe following is the same USA graph as just above, but with Influenza and Tuberculosis Deaths included.\u00c2\u00a0 And you can see that Influenza deaths were not prevented by a vaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because for most of the period covered, there was no vaccine available at all and when it became available, it was not freely available until the present day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when guess what \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflu mortality had already plummeted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and guess what else \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it does not work particularly well either \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in fact so badly it may well be best avoided.\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\nThe following is the same graph as above but showing the full curve for influenza and pneumonia mortality.\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\nHere we see Diphtheria mortality falling all by itself.\u00c2\u00a0 In the UK, the vaccine was introduced in 1940, but most children particularly under 5 did not get it\u00c2\u00a0 and there was a large catch-up campaign in 1945-6 as previously explained [above].\u00c2\u00a0 The under 5 age group are the most at risk from infectious disease.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\n[SOURCE: Data \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Official Year Books of the Commonwealth of Australia, as reproduced in Greg Beattie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccination A Parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dilemma\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Downloadable Now]\nDiphtheria vaccine was introduced to the UK in 1940.\u00c2\u00a0 As already noted, it appears beyond doubt that diptheria vaccine was not responsible for the sudden fall in diphtheria mortality from 1941 to 1946 [see graph].\u00c2\u00a0 The records show at least half of all children up to the age of 15 went unvaccinated until 1946-7 ie. after the major fall.\u00c2\u00a0 The graph of total infant mortality provides a benchmark showing the continuing steady decline in the rate of infant mortality before and after the introduction of the vaccine. \nBy the end of 1941:-\nIt was not until 1946-7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after the substantial fall in diphtheria mortality had taken place that a major effort was made to vaccinate the children who had been missed. 969,000 children under 5 were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immunised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: British Journal of Nursing October 1948 p121.

The decline in general infant mortality closely follows the decline in Whooping Cough mortality in the general population.\u00c2\u00a0 This again demonstrates that the decline in Whooping Cough mortality was part of a general trend and had little or nothing to do with the introduction of vaccination:-\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\n[Click Graph to Enlarge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Opens In New Window]\nThis graph demonstrates that the administration of tetanus vaccine is likely to be pointless and puts children especially at risk of adverse reactions to the vaccines.\nThere is only one respect in which modern medicine could have had an indirect effect.\u00c2\u00a0 This came with the social reforms of 1947-48 which saw the introduction of the National Health Service.\u00c2\u00a0 Coupled with this was the start of the reduction in numbers of farm workers with the start of increased mechanisation and industrial scale farming in Britain after the 1939-1945 World War.\u00c2\u00a0 The numbers of farm labourers fell by half post war and the increase in mechanisation also reduced the chances of the injuries which were likely to result in tetanus\nFewer agricultural workers coupled with better access to healthcare would result in better treatment of wounds.\u00c2\u00a0 Tetanus thrives in deep wounds which are not properly cleansed.\u00c2\u00a0 So by having fewer agricultural workers and better wound care could reduce the incidence of tetanus cases.\u00c2\u00a0 So if the reduction in tetanus mortality in the 1950s is anything other than part of the continuing decline with better standards of living, those two reasons are the most likely explanations.\nIn the graphs notice the large numbers of deaths caused by the smallpox vaccine itself.\u00c2\u00a0 By 1901 in the UK, more people died from the smallpox vaccination than from smallpox itself.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 When during 1880-1908 the City of Leicester in England stopped vaccination compared to the rest of the UK and elsewhere, its survival rates soared and smallpox death rates plummetted [see table below].\u00c2\u00a0 Leicester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach also cost far less.\nOn any scientific analysis of the history and data, crediting smallpox vaccine for the decline in smallpox appears misplaced.

I had mumps on my first day of school\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.no ill effects. Then in rapid succession I got  rubella (hardly noticed but I got lifelong immunity confirmed by a blood test when I was 19), then measles and scarlet fever\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still here. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get chicken pox til I was 17 (the worst  of the so-called childhood diseases at that age\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..wish I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d got it earlier as I missed mock  A levels\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.my husband got chicken pox at age 24\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6he was so ill) My eldest daughter had mumps and rubella and I did let her have the single measles vaccination at 18 months.. Why did my GP push for her to have the MMR at ages 15? (I refused) I asked him. No answer. I asked how many children had blood tests to see if they had in fact got antibodies from the vaccination (not necessarily protection from catching the disease as you know) He looked at me in surprise. I asked him \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat if a girl has the rubella vaccine but happens to be under the weather and the vaccine doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and then she thinks she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protected and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t avoid rubella when she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pregnant?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6again he looked at me in surprise. I asked him why he trusted that the vaccines always worked and that there were no side effects. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to him any more. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very, very difficult for conventionally trained medical folks to step outside the box. My husband taught classical guitar to a charming, gentle psychologist who teaches medical students. She sees many of them them turn from eager, keen, bright youngsters into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 who daren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rock the boat in case they get disciplined by the old boys. She herself encountered arrogance from some medics when her rmother was ill. She returned to her students and begged them not to become arrogant when they qualify. Several sneered and said they were entitled to! Sigh! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a nurse and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked with wonderful, wonderful medics whom I would trust with my life so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoctor basher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but things have to come out in the open. If they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d still be bleeding and purging! Look up how George Washington died\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.thanks in part to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbest medics of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t malevolent, they just believed they were doing their best. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that quote about truth going through three stages? First it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ridiculed, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehemently fought against and then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accepted as self-evident. Something like that. I just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that injecting noxious stuff directly into the body, bypassing the normal protective measurs of the mucous membranes etc is beneficial, especially into tiny babies (even newborns!) when their immune system is not fully functional. How can it be right to give them a cocktail of umpteen vaccines (where would they get Hep B anyway? And where\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the vaccine for Hep C\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.far more contagious) Surely good nutrition, clean water, decent housing etc is far more beneficial to produce a sound immune system. How on earth did the human race survive for eons without vaccination? How come we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all die out? Animals too\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re being affected by their multiple vaccinations\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.how did animals survive? Somehow all this vaccination hype just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up. And how can one type of flu vaccination \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprotect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 against a rapidly mutating virus? And have there been double\u00e2\u20ac\u2122blind trials to test it? Sorry to go on\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you get the picture. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry that some commenters have to get so cross. I am a Quaker and in our advices and queries (not a creed or dogma) one stands out \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcConsider it possible that you may be wrong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Once upon a time they said that the USA would fold without the slave trade\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.a few wise good souls didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go along with that. The slave trade was abolished\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.what happened? Well the USA went on to become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy. I know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not healthy now but you see what I mean.\n[ED:  Jimmy, did you ever get a reply to your open letter? Did you ever send it to the person concerned?  How come you just ignored the evidence on CHS and went off making false and wild claims?  \nThe following goes to show James D Cole [aka jdc325 and 325jdc] is mathematically challenged, ignorant or a untruthful or possibly all three. He can say which he wants to be known as.\nSo James, your data must also be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misleading, out-of-date, and inaccurate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nThe reason he gave to justify this claim was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Acute measles infection has claimed lives in years when\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the graph \u00e2\u20ac\u0153predicted no deaths would occur\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nAnd with only 2 deaths from acute measles [according to the HPA] since 1992, that works out at a chance of 0.1 deaths per annum over the entire population of England and Wales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is roughly 55 million \u00e2\u20ac\u201c give or take for annual fluctuations etc.\nSo not only is the trendline on both graphs presenting a reliable picture showing mortality falling below 1 in 55 million per annum, but actual mortality is in line with the trend shown by both graphs.\nAnd as this is a logarithmic graph, it does not predict no deaths as Cole claims \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so again either he is untruthful or ignorant or mathematically challenged or all of these.  Do let us know James.\nSo not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153daft graph\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at all but one showing much the same trend as the HPA data shows.  So also not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misleading\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nWhereas it is moronic to contradict that statement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a chance of 0.1 deaths per annum over the entire population of England and Wales, we and most normal people would be inclined to think that 0.1 per annum per 55 million population is sufficiently below 1 in 55 million to be reliably within the trend.\nBut of course for mathematically challenged people over at Ben Goldacre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Badscience.net forum 0.1 is a way larger number than 1.  \nSo Cole then moves on from abuse arising from his own ignorance, mathematical incompetence or dishonesty to complain that as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153measles-containing vaccine coverage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has been at or above 80% since the introduction of MMR in 1988\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How on earth can you (or anyone else) possibly justify using the figures for measles mortality in a country with 80%+ levels of vaccination to suggest that the chances of death if no one were vaccinated would be less than 1 in 55 million?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAnd particularly, the fact that a exponential trendline results in a straightline is an immensely strong indication that measles mortality would continue to fall exponentially.  If the introduction of the vaccines had any effect that effect would be to accelerate the fall.\nSo James, you see, it can be done.\nAnd to make the point more firmly, here is the ONS data plotted up to 1967 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c before the introduction of the measles vaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and with the trendline plotted forward to where the chance of mortality falls below 1 in 55 million:\nBut you just will not ever accept you are wrong.  We saw that with your attack on Sue Reid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s journalism where you were forced to admit you attacked her professionalism solely because you disagreed with her reporting in a national newspaper the Italian Health Ministry not contesting the evidence before the Italian Court showing that the MMR vaccine did cause Valentino Bocca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autism.\nAnd here we see the same thing.  Despite 110 years of data and clear mathematically presented graphical evidence, James D Cole [aka jdc325 and 325jdc] just cannot accept it because it goes against the position he has taken and he can never admit he is wrong.  He cannot admit that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the event of a zero rate of vaccination\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the annual rate of measles mortality will still continue to decrease.\nJames D Cole also cannot accept the clear conclusion of the peer reviewed medical paper cited in the article above: Englehandt SF, Halsey NA, Eddins DL, Hinman AR. Measles mortality in the United States 1971-1975. Am J Public Health 1980;70:1166\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1169 which also confirms that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Measles mortality rates were inversely related to median family income\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which means in baby language that as people become better off year on year, measles mortality will keep on falling.\nIn the teeth of the evidence from 110 years James D Cole firmly believes or is being dishonest in stating that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All it would take to kill hundreds in the next decade would be for vaccination coverage to drop sufficiently. It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have to drop to zero \u00e2\u20ac\u201c somewhere between 55-75% ought to do it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nBut UK measles vaccine coverage was well below 55% in the 1970\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and early 1980s.  The average UK mortality  between 1968 when the single measles vaccine was introduced and 1987 was 20 and not hundreds and was falling over that entire period at the same rate exponentially as it had been before 1968.\nAnd James you clearly are being dishonest in claiming a graph is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misleading, out-of-date, and inaccurate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when 1) it states clearly on its face the periods it covered \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1900-1999 2) the two deaths you talk about were in 2006 and 2008 3) there had been no deaths from acute measles since 1992 3) the HPA data shows the much the same trend as that graph and 4) the trendline was used to illustrate the position by 2007 of mortality falling below 1 in 55 million by then \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which it most certainly had done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c based on the trend of 100 years data to 1999.\nStill no answer (I kind of start liking our little, internal jokes).\nI didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any statements there, barring one about no evidence for linkage. Otherwise than that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you are the one who challenges the consensus, burden of the proof lies with you. \nMoreover, something I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t noticed before \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you make a regression on years 1955-65 your curve will have a slope that is not significantly different from zero. 10 years of no improvement and suddenly off we go. Here you have it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c evidence (as in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not proof\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) that it would not at all be hilarious that sanitation improvement stopped being the decisive factor and vaccination took over.\nNow let me answer my own questions since you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not bold enough to confront them:\n Your website is fighting some claims that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ring vaccination\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t save the day and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m inclined to agree (who cares now if it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or not?) as long as you agree with the article you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re quoting [Kaplan et al.] which provides a very nice correlation between vaccination and incidence of smallpox.\n 10) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you agree that serious adverse reactions to vaccines are substantially under reported?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (your question) No, is it a consensus I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve missed? But bring it on, I want to see evidence. And funny that measles incidence is overreported, but serious consequences of the vaccine are underreported. Funny that CDR is constantly reporting that most (if not all) confirmed cases of measles are in unvaccinated people (but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not against efficacy of vaccines, are you?)\nIt is interesting to note from the graphs you have put up (Figure 1: Reported measles cases and death per 100,000 population, United States, 1912-1975) that while measles mortality dropped before vaccination, due to improved sanitation and better nutrition, the incidence remained the same at 200-400 cases per 100,000 population until the 1960\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, since when, incidence has dropped markedly to a minimum, with a later peak which still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go above 40 per 100,000 population! The beginning of the decline coincides with the introduction of Measles vaccination in the early 1960\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. \nYou seem to be having problems interpreting graphs and available information. See, it is a known bias in scientific research that when we look for information with a particular objective in mind, we are generally biased to find more on what we seek, and neglect available information on what we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to see.\nVaccines are not the best means of prevention for all diseases. Scarlet fever and typhoid are diseases that are treatable by antibiotics and preventable by good hygiene. Although vaccine is available for typhoid, the efficacy is lower, and public health officials do not promote universally vaccinating all children against typhoid! Influenza another disease that may not benefit everyone from vaccination. Note that in most countries, it is available commercially (for sale) and not subsidized by governments. The disease is not severe, except in extremes of age, and the virus continuously mutates, so the vaccine strain may only be effective for a short epidemic of the particular vaccine strain (generally for about 1 year or a season). It may benefit elderly, who carry higher risk of death from influenza.\nVaccines that have been used extensively in humans over long periods of time with proven reduction of death and disease burden include vaccines included in childhood vaccination programmes (EPI programmes) in most countries. These vaccines are given to reduce diseases with high burdens of death and\/or disability (eg. polio, measles), where effective curative treatment (eg. antivirals) is not available or limited in efficacy (eg. Hepatitis B). These are fully funded (available free) or subsidized by governments after considering (with technical advice form agencies like the WHO) whether these diseases are prevalent in their countries, or may cause huge losses if introduced into a non-immune community, and the benefits of the vaccines, vs. risks.\n:\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdAttentuation is a well-known phenomenon. Good luck with your opinions. Immunity can be afforded by asymptomatic infection \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you know, where the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disease\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd circulates amongst those who suffer no symptoms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe death rates for these diseases for the unvaccinated but otherwise healthy in developed world in the last couple of decades world are well known. Your focus on smallpox, an extinct disease is baffling.The death rates make a nonsense of your claims:\nMortality rates from measles in America and the developed world in the unvaccinated are 1\/5000, not 1 in 25 million.\nMortality rates from rubella are about 1\/300 in the US, and about 1\/900 with one of the worlds best healthcare system (Netherlands outbreak in unvaccinated children in religious groups).\nDiptheria mortality is 1\/5 for young children, about 1\/10 for adults.\nThe vaccinated don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get these diseases. If you flipped the UK magically to being unvacinated for all things, a couple of million people at least would die. Compared to perhaps a hundred or so dead or brain damaged from vaccines. And no, they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t 100% safe, no medicine is.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve noticed you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve avoided posting modern mortality rates here. Also, no direct comparisones of before vaccination to after vaccinated death rates. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show the change in different death rates, you just show the improvement in survival rates due to the improvement of living standards and health care over the 20th century.\nWell, chickenpox has a mortality rate too. About 90 people die in the US, mainly adults with complications, but also healthy children  The death rate is about 1\/100,000,000 for healthy children, but 1\/300,000 for adults. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in the UK, where we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate. Introduction of the chickenpox vaccine in the US saves about 70-80 lives a year.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d also to like point out Encephalopathy is caused by viral infections. These are a known but rare kind of vaccination injury. Not caused by thimerasol by by the virus vaccine. A non vaccinated person is at higher risk of encepahalitis when they catch \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwild\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 variants of rubella \/measles etc. Herpes (cold sore) encephalitis is a known cause of ASD type brain injury. This kind of brain damage from encephalopaty is really rare.\nAnd the overwhelming results from scientific studies into autism find that there has been no real increase in the rates of autism over the past few decades, just increased diagnosis. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dug through the studies, only one Californian study supports in increase, about a dozen others support no change\/better diagnosis.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some children who would nowadays be diagnosed unambiguously with autistic disorder had been diagnosed with developmental language disorder in the past. This finding has implications for our understanding of the epidemiology of autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rate of pervasive developmental disorders is higher than reported 15 years ago. The rate in this study is comparable to that in previous birth cohorts from the same area and surveyed with the same methods, suggesting a stable incidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThere is evidence that the broadening of the concept, the expansion of diagnostic criteria, the development of services, and improved awareness of the condition have played a major role in explaining this increase, although it cannot be ruled out that other factors might have also contributed to that trend. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Although it is clear that prevalence estimates have gone up over time, this increase most likely represents changes in the concepts, definitions, service availability, and awareness of autistic-spectrum disorders in both the lay and professional public.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The true incidence of autism spectrum disorders is likely to be within the range of 30-60 cases per 10 000, a huge increase over the original estimate 40 years ago of 4 per 10000. The increase is largely a consequence of improved ascertainment and a considerable broadening of the diagnostic concept. However, a true risk due to some, as yet to be identified, environmental risk factor cannot be ruled out. There is no support for the hypothesis for a role of either MMR or thimerosal in causation, but the evidence on the latter is more limited\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recorded prevalence of autism has increased considerably in recent years. This reflects greater recognition, with changes in diagnostic practice associated with more trained diagnosticians; broadening of diagnostic criteria to include a spectrum of disorder; a greater willingness by parents and educationalists to accept the label (in part because of entitlement to services); and better recording systems, among other factors. The cause(s) of autism remains unclear. There is a strong genetic component which, along with prenatally determined neuro-anatomical\/biochemical changes, makes any post-natal \u00e2\u20ac\u2122cause\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 unlikely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153To our knowledge, there is no published information on the epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in adults. If the prevalence of autism is increasing, rates in older\n Conclusions  Conducting epidemiologic research on ASD in adults is feasible. The prevalence of ASD in this population is similar to that found in children. The lack of an association with age is consistent with there having been no increase in prevalence and with its causes being temporally constant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nABSTRACT\u00e2\u20ac\u201dAccording to some lay groups, the nation is experiencing an autism epidemic\u00e2\u20ac\u201da rapid escalation in the prevalence of autism for unknown reasons. However, no sound scientific evidence indicates that the increasing number of diagnosed cases of autism arises from anything other than purposely broadened diagnostic criteria, coupled with deliberately greater public awareness and intentionally improved case finding. Why is the public perception so disconnected from the scientific evidence? In this article we review three primary sources of  misunderstanding: lack of awareness about the changing diagnostic criteria, uncritical acceptance of a conclusion illogically drawn in a California-based study, and inattention to a crucial feature of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchild count\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data reported annually by the U.S. Department of Education.\nthe study, by researchers from the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy at Columbia University, found that children living near a child who has been previously diagnosed with autism have a much higher chance of being diagnosed themselves in the following year. The increased likelihood of being diagnosed is not due to environmental factors or contagious agents, the study found. Rather, it is due mainly to parents learning about autism from other parents who have a child diagnosed with the disorder.\nWe could not assess changes in actual disease incidence with these data, but federal and state administrative changes in policy and law favoring better identification and reporting of autism are likely contributing factors to the prevalence increases and may imply that autism spectrum disorder has been underdiagnosed in the past.\nEven though the prevalence rates refer to slightly different age cohorts, it was concluded that the apparent increase is in part due to better detection, but also to new cases born to immigrant parents. Typical cases of autistic disorder accounted for 75% of cases, and 20% had normal or near-normal IQs.\nReevaluating the incidence of pervasive developmental disorders: impact of elevated rates of detection through implementation of an integrated system of screening in Toyota, Japan. \nAn approximately 11-fold increase was noted in prevalence of PDD compared to a previous survey two decades ago, and two main factors were believed to account for this apparent sharp increase. First, inclusion of high-functioning subjects detected during infancy, and second, higher rates of diagnosis resulting from an integrated process of screening.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in my forties, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve known five autistic boys, one is a relative. Back in the eighties and seventies, only one would have been diagnosed with autism, the others all have fairly mild Aspergers. Even the obviously autistic one would probably be have been labelled as retarded not autistic.I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve asked older teachers and doctors if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a higher incidence now. The answer has been a mix of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbetter diagnosis and awareness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the  GP and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwe just used to call them naughty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from older teachers.\nWell I am pleased to see intelligent people having a reasonable discussion, a little sad about the name calling and anger demonstrated by both sides of the debate.  I am a research scientist working in the field of sepsis, after having my first child I became very interested in vaccines for obvious reasons.\n To the author of this blog, first of all great job in putting this information together, the pro vaccine agenda clearly has more money, influence, and the advantage in promoting the pro vaccine view when compared to the anti-vaccine group.  That being said as a scientist who knows a little bit about basic immunology, would you deny the basic immunological principles of  T-cell and B-cell memory cells?  Sorry if I bore people but very basic simplified immunology describes that upon an initial infection cells such as neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells migrate to the site of infection this process is termed the innate immune response, as the infection persists macrophages, B-cells and dendritic cells phagocytose antigen\/bacteria and present them to T-cells this later process is termed the adaptive immune response, in addition B-cells begin to undergo isotype switching and will produce antibodies.  After the infection has been cleared there will be antibodies left to that foreign pathogen and memory T-cells to that pathogen.  These memory cells remain and if that same pathogen is encountered again these memory cells are capable of removing the pathogen much faster than the initial infection, this process is called immunological memory.  Taken together vaccines are nothing more than a replication of these basic immunology principles.  A live virus, partial virus (cell wall, specific proteins) or a whole inactive virus at low doses are used to generate an immune response to create immunological memory.  If this process occurs naturally in nature, why is their so much fear about the practical application of vaccines that replicate this natural process?  Vaccines are based on sound scientific principles.  I was born in 1980 so I took the entire cascade of vaccines and more when I started working due to patient contact.\n How can 46 does of 14 vaccines by the age of 6 be normal?  What are the long term effects of priming a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system that many times.  In addition to autism look at the all the auto immune disorders that have been popping up, psoriasis for example, look at the increased amount of allergic response that occur in the West due to hyper-active immune systems. I am also concerned about thimerosal, they tell pregnant women to watch their fish consumption for mercury but it is ok for infants to get this many doses.  I am also concerned about squalene and others agents found in vaccines that cause infertility.  Most importantly I am concerned about the marriage of big pharma with our health and doctors, allopathic medicine more often than not tends to want to cure everything with pharmaceuticals and than cure the side effects with more pharmaceuticals and none the while never looking at natural alternative remedies.\n","38":"Key point. Restrictions imposed by state law on unvaccinated children attending public schools may not violate parents' constitutional right of religious freedom.\nA federal appeals court ruled that the constitutional right of parents to the free exercise of their religion was not violated by a state law excluding unvaccinated children from public schools under specified circumstances. New York requires that students in the state's public schools be immunized against various vaccine-preventable illnesses. The New York Public Health Law provides that \"no principal, teacher, owner or person in charge of a school shall permit any child to be admitted to such school, or to attend such school, in excess of fourteen days\" without a certificate of immunization. The statute provides two exemptions from the immunization mandate. First, a medical exemption is available \"if any physician licensed to practice medicine in this state certifies that such immunization may be detrimental to a child's health.\" Second, a religious exemption is available for \"children whose parent, parents, or guardian hold genuine and sincere religious beliefs which are contrary to the practices herein required.\"\nTwo unrelated parents (the \"Plaintiffs A and B\") received religious exemptions for their children. In November 2011 and January 2012, however, the plaintiffs' children were excluded from school when a fellow student was diagnosed with chicken pox, pursuant to a state regulation that provides, \"in the event of an outbreak \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 of a vaccine-preventable disease in a school, the commissioner, or his or her designee \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 may order the appropriate school officials to exclude from attendance\" students who received exemptions from mandatory vaccination.\n","39":"Veterinary vaccines are being used with increasing frequency in the United States to protect the health of animals. In addition                   to their direct benefit to animals, these vaccines have also markedly decreased the risk of transmission of many zoonotic                   infections (e.g., rabies and brucellosis) to humans. The US Department of Agriculture currently licenses >2000 vaccines for                   use in animals [1]. Most of these vaccines are inactivated formulations, but >500 live vaccine formulations for animals are also licensed.                   Veterinary vaccines are intended only for use in animals and are not tested for safety in humans. However, humans may inadvertently                   be exposed to these products by means of unintentional inoculation or other routes of exposure.                \nThe extent to which veterinary vaccines pose a health hazard to humans is unclear. The increased use of veterinary vaccines                   may be accompanied by an increase in human exposure to the vaccine strains, thus increasing the potential for adverse effects.                   In addition, new methods of vaccine administration may result in an increased likelihood of inadvertent exposure. For example,                   increased use of aerosol administration may result in greater human exposure to animal vaccines. For some animal vaccines,                   such as those administered to prevent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kennel cough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in dogs, aerosol administration is becoming the preferred route. Also,                   oral administration of vaccines that contain live agents is becoming more common. Orally administered vaccines have been developed                   for rabies prophylaxis in wildlife, and millions of baits have been distributed. The administration of live vaccines to animals                   destined for the human food supply may result in human exposure to a vaccine strain. Illness subsequent to such an exposure                   is unlikely to be recognized by the patient or the physician as a potential consequence of an animal vaccine exposure.                \nIn addition to an increased risk of exposure, there may be an increased likelihood of an adverse side effect in exposed individuals,                   because an increasing proportion of the US population is immunosuppressed due to advanced age or other reasons (e.g., HIV                   infection, receipt of chemotherapy, or receipt of an organ transplant). These populations are known to be at increased risk                   of zoonotic infection [2], and the likelihood of adverse consequences following exposure to a live animal vaccine or to an animal infected with a                   vaccine strain is higher for this population than for those who are immunocompetent. Currently, veterinary facilities do not                   routinely warn pet owners when they are administering live aerosol vaccines in close proximity to the owners, and the risk                   among immunocompromised pet owners of acquiring an infection with a vaccine strain directly from the vaccine or from shedding                   of the vaccine strain is unknown.                \nThere have been few reports of suspected or confirmed problems in humans that are associated with animal vaccines, with the                   exception of brucellosis vaccines, but it is unclear whether this is because few adverse events occur or because adverse events                   are not recognized and\/or not reported. There is no agency clearly responsible for monitoring and disseminating information                   on adverse effects in humans that is associated with the use of animal vaccines. Surveillance has not been routinely performed                   at the national level for adverse human reactions associated with use of animal vaccines.                \nTo ascertain what was known about human illness associated with exposure to animal vaccines, an Internet search for relevant                   literature was conducted with multiple terms, general terms, such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153veterinary vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153occupational injury,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and                   disease-specific terms. In addition, health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, GA),                   the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) were contacted, as were a number of                   professionals at universities, including veterinary schools.                \nBrucellosis is a zoonotic disease that causes systemic symptoms, including fever of variable frequency and duration, chills,                      headache, weakness, weight loss, arthralgia, and generalized pain [3]. Brucellosis may persist for days to years, if not treated properly. A notifiable condition in the United States, brucellosis                      was reported in 87 individuals in 2000 [4].                   \nThe causative agent of brucellosis is a small gram-negative coccobacillus of the genus Brucella that can infect cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and dogs. Infection may result in severe illness and death, and the disease remains                      a significant threat in many developing areas of the world. Humans may become infected, usually because of contact with animals                      that are infected or with animal products that are contaminated with these bacteria.                   \nThe US Brucellosis Eradication Program (Web site, http:\/\/cofcs66.aphis.usda.gov\/bad\/refbook2000\/Brucellosis.pdf) was established in 1934 as a state and federal partnership with the aim of eliminating brucellosis in cattle, and the program                      has had considerable success. Human disease, however, has been associated with use of the S19 vaccine, a live bacterial vaccine                      administered for many years to cattle to control the spread of brucellosis. The current vaccine in use, RB51, is a modified                      live culture vaccine that was developed and marketed in 1996 as a replacement for the S19 vaccine. License restrictions have                      limited its use to veterinarians or to those supervised by veterinarians, and distribution has been limited to recipients                      authorized by state officials. RB51 has been considered less virulent than the S19 strain, on the basis of results of animal                      testing. However, both local and systemic side effects in humans have been documented as being associated with the RB51 vaccine.                   \nTo assess the risk of disease following occupational exposure to the RB51 vaccine, the CDC initiated a passive surveillance                      registry in 1998 to report unintentional autoinoculation of RB51 vaccine by veterinarians and by others at risk for occupational                      exposure (David Ashford, CDC, unpublished data). Twenty-six individuals reported exposure to the RB51 vaccine to the CDC from                      January 1998 through December 1999. Twenty-one (81%) of the individuals reported needlestick injuries, and, of 5 patients                      (19%) who were splashed with the RB51 vaccine, 4 were splashed in their conjunctiva and 1 was splashed in an open wound. Even                      though most individuals (69%) reported receiving prophylactic antibiotics, 19 (73%) reported at least 1 systemic symptom,                      with 7 (27%) having persistent symptoms for >6 months. One patient required surgery, and Brucella abortus strain RB51 was isolated from the patient's surgical wound.                   \nApproximately 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 million doses of Brucella vaccines were administered annually from 1997 through 2000, and it is estimated that at least 8000 needlestick injuries resulting                      in unintentional inoculation would be expected during this period (David Ashford, unpublished data. Thus, the number of individuals                      infected with the RB51 strain may be considerably higher than the number reported to the passive surveillance registry at                      the CDC. In addition, surveillance is complicated because routine serological tests for the detection of Brucella species do not detect exposure to the RB51 strain [5].                   \nThere have been reports from other countries of brucellosis following vaccination with a live bacterial strain. Acute brucellosis                      due to unintentional injection of animal vaccine that contained an attenuated Brucella melitensis strain was described in a young veterinarian [6], and 2 cases of brucellosis were reported from Spain [7]. In addition, a 10-year-old boy in South Africa was hospitalized with bacteremia due to Brucella after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153playing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with vials of brucellosis vaccine on a farm tractor; the Brucella species was characterized in the laboratory as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccine strain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Keith Klugman, Emory University, personal communication).                   \nIn addition to direct exposure to the vaccine, Brucella infection with RB51 vaccine strain in a stillborn calf has resulted in occupational exposure of at least 9 persons to the                      RB51 strain; 8 of the 9 individuals began receiving chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline within 1 week after exposure, and none                      became symptomatic during the 6-month follow-up period [5]. The 14-month-old heifer that delivered the calf was not known to be pregnant when she was vaccinated with RB51 at \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc8 months                      of age, which was within the specified age range for vaccination.                   \nIt was recently documented in Israel that the B. melitensis vaccine strain Rev.1 could persist in animals and could be secreted in milk. Furthermore, they documented an isolate recovered                      from a human that resembled the vaccine strain Rev.1, on the basis of results of conventional bacteriological testing [8].                   \nThe problem of brucellosis in the United States is decreasing as a result of the implementation of the brucellosis eradication                      program. Although the number of cases may be decreasing, the continued presence of the disease in some areas of the United                      States, the continued use of the vaccine, and the potential use of Brucella species as an agent of bioterrorism make it important that physicians understand the signs and symptoms of the disease, as                      well as the circumstances under which infection may be acquired. Diagnostic tests for detecting infection with the RB51 strain                      need to be available. The CDC no longer conducts a formal surveillance registry; however, the CDC continues to provide consultation                      on brucellosis and to receive reports of prophylaxis failure (telephone number, 404-639-3158); the Center for Veterinary Biologics,                      USDA, also accepts reports to its Inspection and Compliance Unit.                   \nTo control the spread of rabies in wildlife populations, live-virus vaccines containing either modified live rabies virus                      or recombinant vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein virus are placed in oral baits that are then widely distributed in parts of North                      America and Europe; the recombinant vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein virus is used in baits in the United States. The use of such                      baits continues to increase, and, until 2000, no adverse events in humans were reported as having been due to human exposure                      to the vaccine-containing baits. More than 3 million baits had been distributed in Ohio since the beginning of 1997, with                      >22 million baits distributed nationwide from 1990 through 2000. In Ohio, toll-free numbers are printed on baits, and callers                      can reports baits if they are found. In 20 of 160 reports of contact with a bait, persons reported exposure to the vaccine,                      with evidence that the inner sachet containing the vaccine had ruptured. Two of the 20 instances of exposure likely involved                      persons with a contraindication to vaccination with the vaccinia virus. In 1 of these 2 instances, a 26-year-old woman was                      exposed to the recombinant vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein virus vaccine, which led to severe illness and resulted in hospitalization                      [9]. The woman was 15 weeks pregnant and had epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. She recovered and later delivered a healthy infant                      who had no evidence of infection.                   \nThe case of vaccinia virus infection in this woman highlights the risk associated with vaccines that contain vaccinia virus,                      including animal vaccines. A tremendous amount of attention has recently been given to potential adverse events associated                      with vaccinia vaccine for the protection of individuals against smallpox. The risk of contact transmission of vaccinia virus                      via smallpox vaccination has been estimated to be 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 cases per 100,000 primary vaccinations, with 1 to 2 cases of eczema                      vaccinatum resulting from such transmission per 100,000 primary vaccinations [10]. Relatively little attention, however, has been paid to the increasing rate of exposure of humans to vaccinia virus due                      to contact with wildlife baits. The vaccinia virus strain used in wildlife vaccine may be less virulent than the strain used                      in the smallpox vaccine currently licensed for human use in the United States. There was only 1 reported case of vaccinia                      virus infection among 160 reports of human contact with \u00e2\u00a9\u00be1 of the 3.8 million baits dropped in Ohio; however, a marked increase                      in the use of baits may result in more cases of human vaccinia virus infection, including eczema vaccinatum. Physicians should                      be alert to this possibility when they see a patient with vesicular lesions. Patients with vesicular lesions of unknown etiology                      should be questioned regarding contact with animal baits. Also, baits should be clearly labeled, such that an exposure of                      an individual to a bait will be recognized as such and recalled during questioning. The recent change in wrapping the baits                      to make them blend in with the environment should be assessed to determine whether individuals would recognize bait exposure.                   \nA different consideration is whether the release of live vaccinia virus into the environment may lead to the creation of a                      wildlife reservoir in the United States for vaccinia virus. Such baits have been used in Europe for 20 years and in the United                      States for 10 years, and there has been no evidence that vaccinia virus is persisting in the environment. However, Damaso                      et al. [11] recently reported a viral infection in Brazil that may be the first case of long-term persistence of vaccinia virus in nature                      in the New World. Virus was isolated from specimens of skin lesions on dairy cows and milkers in Brazil, and sequences of                      the hemagglutinin gene substantiated the isolate classification as being an Old World orthopoxvirus. The virus was designated                      the Cantagolo virus (CTGV), and comparison of the hemagglutinin gene sequences with those of the Brazilian smallpox vaccine                      strain (W-IOC) used >20 years ago and those of CTGV showed 98.2% identity and suggested that CTGV may have derived from W-IOC                      by persisting in an indigenous animal and now emerging in cattle and milkers as CTGV. Currently, the only known vaccinia virus                      species established in nature is buffalopox virus, which causes localized lesions on milking buffalo and dairy cattle and                      causes oropharyngeal lesions in humans who have consumed contaminated unpasteurized milk. Buffalopox virus epidemics were                      first noted during the smallpox vaccination era in India, Egypt, and Indonesia. The reservoir for vaccinia virus, if it exists,                      is unknown [12]; it may be indigenous animals (e.g., voles and field mice). Additional follow-up to identify whether rodents or other indigenous                      animals are carrying the strain and to identify the extent of human disease would be useful and would assist in the assessment                      of the potential threat associated with extensive use of wildlife baits for the oral administration of rabies vaccine.                   \nB. bronchiseptica causes tracheobronchitis in dogs and atrophic rhinitis in swine; it also causes disease in rabbits and other mammals. B. bronchiseptica infection in humans is considered rare but has been documented in both healthy and immunosuppressed individuals [13\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16]. In healthy individuals, pertussis-like illness and chronic respiratory infection have been reported. Some cases of pertussis-like                      illness in humans have followed exposure to sick pets or farm animals. The disease is more likely to be severe in individuals                      who are immunocompromised, such as those with Hodgkin disease, cystic fibrosis, or HIV infection [17, 18]. Pneumonia, sepsis, and death have been reported after infection [14,19, 20].                   \nBordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, and B. bronchiseptica are closely related species that all may cause respiratory tract infection in humans and other mammals and may express many                      similar virulence factors [21]. Variant strains of Bordetella species exist, and these species are not always distinct [13]. Recent investigations indicate that the species are extremely versatile and can adapt to the environment in a number of                      host organisms and that host range adaptation appears to be an ongoing process. B. pertussis and B. parapertussis may have recently evolved from B. bronchiseptica, and human pathogens may continue to evolve from B. bronchiseptica [15].                   \nB. bronchiseptica has a gene that codes for pertussis toxin (PT). Although some experts believe the gene is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153silent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd there is evidence that                      the gene may be expressed in vivo, even though the strains do not produce PT in vitro [18]. Clinical isolates of B. bronchiseptica were obtained from 2 immunocompetent children with pertussis-like illness and both were documented to possess anti-PT antibodies,                      even though the same strains did not produce PT under laboratory conditions [13]. In addition, nosocomial transmission has been documented [22].                   \nThere is a previously unpublished report of a child who was exposed to a live Bordetella vaccine and developed pertussis-like illness. In October 2000, 5 days after being sprayed directly in the face with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kennel                      cough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vaccine, a 14-year-old boy became ill with a pertussis-like illness. His illness was characterized by a paroxysmal                      cough that persisted for 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 months, accompanied by posttussive vomiting. The boy was treated with antibiotics for a suspected                      case of pertussis; no cultures were performed. No cases of pertussis had been reported in the state during the previous 2                      months; no pertussis-like illness had occurred at the boy's school or on his sports team. He had not traveled the month before                      the onset of illness, and he was otherwise healthy.                   \nIn this instance, a veterinarian had sprayed the 14-year-old boy directly in the face with an aerosol that contained parainfluenza                      virus and B. bronchiseptica live vaccine, known by most pet owners as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kennel cough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vaccine. The veterinarian had planned to administer the vaccine                      intranasally to the boy's dog. The boy was holding the dog's head; when the dog moved, the veterinarian sprayed the vaccine                      directly into the boy's face, and the boy received the dose intended for the 30-kg dog. The veterinarian said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not to worry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd                      and joked that the boy was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153now vaccinated against kennel cough.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd                   \nIn January 2001, the CDC obtained vaccine from the same lot to which the boy was exposed; the vaccine grew 2 morphologically                      different colonies of B. bronchiseptica (G. Sanden, CDC, unpublished data). The USDA processed the licensure of the vaccine, but information on the original safety                      studies or on recent changes in licensure was not easily accessible (David Dusek, Center for Veterinary Biologics, USDA, personal                      communication; Notice 00-14, Center for Veterinary Biologics, USDA, http:\/\/www.aphis.usda.gov\/vs\/cvb\/notices.htm).                   \nIt is unknown whether the case of pertussis-like illness in the 14-year-old boy described above was caused by B. bronchiseptica. That the exposure occurred was clear, and the duration between exposure and the onset of illness was consistent with such                      an illness. The fact that no other cases of pertussis-like illness were reported at the boy's school and in the community                      at large lends additional credence to the possibility that the illness resulted from exposure at the veterinary clinic.                   \nWith the advent of aerosol vaccination in veterinary clinics for companion animals, human exposure to B. bronchiseptica has likely increased in recent years. Physicians should ask patients presenting with pertussis-like illness whether they                      have visited a veterinary clinic or have been exposed to a sick or recently vaccinated animal during the week before the onset                      of symptoms. If the potential for exposure to B. bronchiseptica is present, performance of cultures should be considered before antibiotics are administered.                   \nNo special precautions to avoid human exposure are routinely taken during administration of this aerosol animal vaccine. The                      package insert [23] for the vaccine to which the 14-year-old boy was exposed states that it should be administered via syringe intranasally.                      Even when administered properly, there may be opportunity for human exposure, especially if the animal sneezes, which is a                      common occurrence after intranasal administration of a liquid. In addition, the animal may be able to transmit the vaccine                      strain during the period of active infection.                   \nVeterinarians are at highest risk of exposure to veterinary biologic products. Occupational needlestick transmission of infectious                      agents is a significant concern. Although there is no routine reporting of occupational exposures in veterinary settings,                      some studies have been conducted to examine the rate of needlestick exposure to biologic products. A survey of all women who                      graduated from US veterinary schools from 1970 through 1980 was conducted; of 2532 respondents, 1620 reported a total of 2663                      needlestick events. The reported overall needlestick injury rate was 9.3 sticks per 100 person-years of practice. Substances                      most often injected included vaccines and antibiotics [24].                   \nIn a study of occupational injuries reported by zoo veterinarians in the United States, needle sticks were the most frequent                      injury reported, with 86.7% of respondents reporting \u00e2\u00a9\u00be1 stick and 50% of these sticks involving vaccines. Eighteen zoo veterinarians                      (6.5%) reported adverse reactions, including infections, that required medical treatment, although the type of infection or                      vaccine was not reported [25].                   \nIn addition to veterinarians, individuals engaged in animal farming and aquaculture have an occupational risk of exposure                      to vaccines and vaccine strains. The use of vaccines is increasing because all intensive methods of animal and fish farming                      magnify the problems associated with infections or endemic diseases in animals because the animals and fish are kept in close                      proximity to each other. New vaccines are being developed to prevent infection, and some of these try to eliminate the need                      to administer medications via feedstuff.                   \nThe CDC has investigated a report of an illness that followed the unintentional inoculation of a live anthrax vaccine (Sterne)                      in a 17-year-old woman while she was vaccinating her horse (Michael Bruce, CDC, unpublished data). She sought medical attention                      both for local symptoms that occurred immediately and for systemic symptoms that occurred during the onset of infection within                      24 h after the injection. Neither of 2 blood cultures yielded B. anthracis. There have also been reports of infection after unintentional exposure to vaccines, including Brucella and Newcastle virus vaccines, and warning labels have been developed for those vaccines [26]. The USDA is currently evaluating requirements for warning labels for veterinary vaccines (Louise Henderson, USDA, personal                      communication).                   \nAutoinoculation may result in allergic reactions or toxic inflammatory reactions at the site of injection. These adverse side                      effects are frequently due to the adjuvant, which is utilized to enhance the immune response to vaccine antigens; adjuvants                      are composed of chemicals, microbial components, or mammalian proteins [27]. Adjuvants may cause adverse side effects by increasing the systemic adverse effects of the vaccine, such as fever; more                      often, adjuvants may cause local reactions. Some adjuvants allowed in animal vaccines are not allowed in human vaccines, because                      the tolerance for local inflammatory reactions and the toxicity to tissues is higher in animals than in humans.                   \nReports of toxic inflammatory reactions in veterinarians and others who administer vaccines and sustain unintentional injections                      include reports of reactions to Mycobacterium paratuberculosis bacterin, which is used to prevent Johne disease in cattle [28]. Also, if injections occur in a joint, sterile joint abscesses may occur; in 2001, cases occurred following self-injection                      with a vaccine intended for swine (Steven Mostow, Infectious Disease Society of America [IDSA], unpublished data; John Black,                      IDSA, unpublished data). Necrosis has been reported in the fingers of 4 veterinary technicians in Turkey who accidentally                      stabbed their fingers during vaccination of poultry for Salmonella enterica serotype Enteriditis. All 4 developed severe inflammation, which led to local tissue necrosis of the finger. In the United                      States, devices may be used to protect the hands of workers during injection [29].                   \nIndividuals involved in aquaculture may also be at risk of self-injection. In a survey of professional teams that routinely                      inject fish, professional vaccinators reported from 1 to \u00e2\u00a9\u00be50 self-injections during a single season [30]. Two cases of hospitalization were reported as having been due to anaphylactic reactions. There was no evidence that any                      injectors were infected, but there was evidence that the majority of the reactions were inflammatory or allergic in nature.                      Oil-based vaccines used in the salmon industry have been reported to cause serious tissue necrosis and vascular spasms when                      self-injected.                   \nThere is potential concern that vaccines licensed only for animal use are being or may be used intentionally by humans, especially                      for prophylaxis against diseases for which humans consider themselves at risk but for which no human vaccine has been available                      (e.g., West Nile encephalitis, Lyme disease, and anthrax). Some vaccines (e.g., rabies vaccine) are distributed only to individuals                      with a license; other products are readily available to individuals without a veterinary license (e.g., anthrax vaccine).                      It would be of interest to know whether any individuals self-administered an anthrax vaccine licensed for animal use during                      the recent anthrax incidents in the fall of 2001 on the East Coast. Publicity associated with West Nile encephalitis has led                      to anecdotal reports of individuals who have considered self-administration of West Nile vaccine intended for horses. Would                      recombinant vaccinia-rabies recombinant vaccine be sought and used intentionally by individuals in an attempt to protect them                      from smallpox?                   \nThere is limited knowledge about intentional administration of veterinary biologic products to humans. A survey of veterinarians                      registered with the Idaho Board of Veterinary Medicine was conducted in 1999 to assess their knowledge and perception of the                      intentional administration of veterinary medications to humans; 392 (36.4%) responded [32]. In that survey, systemic antibiotics were among the most frequently reported veterinary medications misused in humans.                      Of the responding veterinarians, 282 (72%) reported that they had been asked questions by caregivers of animals about the                      use of veterinary medications in humans, and 274 (70%) reported human misuse of systemic antibiotics and provided specific                      information on the classes of antibiotics that had been misused. On average, veterinarians suspected that 2.3% of their clients                      who received prescription medications for their animals administered veterinary medication to themselves, their children,                      or their friends. Those who were rural residents, those who worked in health care (particularly veterinary health care), and                      those who had no or inadequate health insurance coverage were among the individuals noted to be most likely to use veterinary                      medications. The veterinarians speculated that the reasons for use included independent and self-sufficient attitudes, the                      convenience and availability of the medication, the lower cost of the medication, or the perception that the medication was                      stronger than the medication administered to humans. The authors suggested that human misuse of veterinary drugs may be more                      common than many health practitioners realize.                   \nIs human exposure to veterinary vaccines a potential public health concern? There is currently limited understanding of the                      incidence of exposure of individuals to veterinary vaccines or of the consequences of such exposure. In addition, the potential                      for exposure and for adverse consequences secondary to exposure to veterinary vaccines may be increasing. The increased development                      and use of veterinary vaccines (including live vaccines), the increased aerosol administration of vaccines, and the increased                      proportion of individuals in the United States who are immunosuppressed and who may be exposed to these vaccines or to animals                      shedding the vaccine strains suggest that increased vigilance may be warranted.                   \nThe process for licensure of animal vaccines differs from that for human vaccines, and it is less rigorous. The USDA regulates                      veterinary vaccines, and the regulations are found in the Virus Serum Toxin Act in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations                      [33]. For the purpose of safety, the regulations state that a vaccine should not cause \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undue local or systemic reactions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; for                      efficacy, the regulations state that a biological product \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shall with reasonable certainty yield the results intended when                      used as recommended\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [33, section 113.6]. In addition to requirements for safety, efficacy, and purity, the USDA performs a risk analysis before licensure                      to assess the risk posed by the vaccine to animals, human health, and the environment; the extent of this analysis varies                      according to vaccine (Louise Henderson, USDA, personal communication). The FDA regulates currently administered human vaccines                      and vaccines under investigation; there is a lengthy prelicensure process that may involve thousands of individuals in clinical                      trials.                   \nSurveillance is conducted to monitor adverse effects of vaccines in animals, and problems have been documented [33]. Safety concerns have included instances of failure to inactivate the virus sufficiently, resulting in disease in the vaccinated                      animals. This has been documented for the foot-and-mouth vaccine, as well as for the Venezuelan equine encephalitis vaccine.                      In addition, there have been adverse reactions to vaccine that were associated with the residual virulence of the vaccine                      organisms. The attenuated vaccine strains may be capable of producing disease in immunosuppressed and\/or pregnant animals                      and have occasionally caused disease in healthy animals [33]. There have also been examples of vaccines that induced lethal disease when administered to a species other than the target                      species [33].                   \nIn addition to problems associated with the vaccine virus strain itself, there are numerous examples of vaccines that have                      been contaminated with extraneous microorganisms, including live Mycoplasma organisms and bluetongue virus [33]. In the early 1990s, a modified live virus vaccine containing canine distemper virus, canine parainfluenza virus, canine                      adenovirus-2, and canine parvovirus was reported to have caused abortion and death when administered to pregnant dogs; the                      vaccine was found to be contaminated with bluetongue virus [34, 35]. Bluetongue virus causes disease in wild and domestic ruminants, and it was not known to cause natural infection and disease                      in dogs.                   \nAvirulent live vaccines are considered more efficient for preventing the spread of some diseases, such as those due to Salmonella infection in poultry raised for human consumption. A French study of several isolates of 3 live vaccine strains of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium demonstrated that the vaccine strains in the environment of the inoculated animals persisted for at                      least 1 month after vaccination [36]. Some vaccine strains persisted in the liver and gut of poultry for at least 10 days. Two of the 3 strains, including 1                      commercially available in the United States, showed evidence of genetic instability, but the investigators were unable to                      link the genetic changes to an impact on safety [37]. A number of issues are raised by such studies, including the public health impact, if any, of animals raised for human                      consumption that are infected with a vaccine strain at the time of slaughter, the potential impact of the persistence of the                      virus in the environment, and the uncertainty posed by the genetic instability of some veterinary vaccines.                   \nWhen physicians see patients with a zoonosis and query about exposure to sick animals, they may also want to query about exposure                      to live vaccines, to the environment in which live vaccines are administered, or to animals to which live vaccine has recently                      been administered. Occupational studies of exposure and outcome may be useful. More information is needed regarding the potential                      misuse of veterinary vaccines. Human misuse may be more common than many health practitioners realize. In 1998, the National                      Poison Control Center (Washington, DC) registered >3700 adverse events associated with human use of medications intended only                      for animal use.                   \nVeterinarians should be instructed to take precautions to avoid exposing themselves or others who are in proximity to the                      animals to the vaccine (e.g., inadvertent administration of aerosol vaccine to an unsuspecting pet owner). Should immunosuppressed                      patients be warned to decrease the risk of exposure to aerosol and non\u00e2\u20ac\u201caerosol formulations of live vaccines? Should warning                      labels be placed on veterinary vaccines to avoid human exposure, and should individuals be aware that human safety studies                      have not been conducted? To what agency or organization should illness suspected to have resulted from human exposure to veterinary                      vaccines be reported? Should there be more safety testing, including increased testing of the genetic stability of the vaccine                      strain? Those who use veterinary vaccines should understand potential human health hazards and should know to whom to report                      suspected adverse consequences of exposure.                   \nVeterinary vaccines have provided enormous economic and health benefits to the animal industry, and they have dramatically                      reduced the incidence of many zoonotic infections in humans. At the same time, as the frequency and administration of animal                      vaccines increase, we must be vigilant regarding human exposure and safety. Health consequences of human exposure to animal                      vaccines or vaccine strains cannot be quantified if they are not recognized and reported. For some diseases, such as brucellosis                      and vaccinia, a link has been clearly documented. For others, such as disease due to B. bronchiseptica infection, additional study to establish whether a link exists is needed. Some form of postmarketing surveillance for human                      adverse events should be considered when new vaccines are introduced, especially live vaccines for zoonotic diseases. Awareness                      of the potential for adverse events after exposure to animal vaccines or to animals vaccinated with a live vaccine should                      increase among physicians, and robust mechanisms of reporting, in addition to follow-up investigation, should be developed                      and implemented for suspected adverse events.                   \n CiteULike\n Delicious\n Facebook\n Google+\n Mendeley\n Twitter\n","40":"Though school just started or is about to start in the United States, federal officials today issued \"report cards\" for some key immunization hallmarks, finding that state vaccine exemption levels are low and vaccination rates are high for kindergarteners.\nIn two reports issued today, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also said immunization rates are high for the nation's infants. The reports, which assess uptake of recommended childhood vaccines and other factors for 2014, appear today in the latest edition of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).\nAt a press briefing today, Anne Schuchat, MD, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said that overall, the news is gratifying in that the overwhelming majority of parents continue to vaccinate their children. However, she warned that even small pockets of undervaccinated children can fuel an outbreak, such as the recent Disney-linked measles outbreak. Immunization programs count on high uptake not only to protect vaccinated children, but also to protect infants and those who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons.\nThe report on vaccine uptake in kindergarteners covers the 2014-15 school year. Median vaccination coverage was 94% for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and 94.2% for local requirements for diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. The levels were slightly below the national goal of 95%.\nAlso, the authors of the report looked at vaccine exemption levels, which stayed low at 1.7%. However, the levels varied by state, from a low of 0.1% in Mississippi to a high of 6.5% in Idaho. Five states did not meet the reporting standards for providing their exemption data.\nSchuchat said a promising finding from the report is that an increasing number of states are providing vaccine-exemption data online. Compared with the previous year, the number grew by three, putting the number of states with that easily accessible number at 21. She said the CDC applauds states for making exemption information routinely available.\n\"Parents should know what's going on around them,\" she said.\nThe second report on infant vaccine uptake\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcentered on children ages 19 to 35 months\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis based on a large survey, with vaccinations reported by parent respondents verified by the providers that vaccinated their children. Schuchat said it's the primary source CDC uses to gauge vaccination levels in younger children. \"For another year, rates remain high,\" she said.\nAccording to the new report, coverage remains high and at levels seen the previous year. Schuchat said the only notable change was increased uptake for hepatitis A vaccine, one of the newer childhood vaccines that the CDC is tracking.\nThough hepatitis A uptake is still below the national goal, national targets were met last year for three or more doses of polio vaccine, one or more doses of MMR vaccine, three or more doses of hepatitis B vaccine, and one or more doses of varicella vaccine.\nSee also:\nAug 27 CDC press release \nAug 27 MMWR report on vaccine coverage in children ages 19 to 35 months \n","41":"The schedule was developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is composed of medical and public health experts. \nWithin the committee are 15 voting members tasked with final approval of each recommendation proposed by the experts. Selected by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, 14 voting members are medical experts who provide knowledge of immunology, pediatrics, public health, infectious diseases and other areas of medicine, while one voting member is a consumer who provides knowledge of the community view of vaccination. \nAmong the non-voting members are representatives of federal agencies and organizations, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices holds three meetings a year to make vaccine recommendations. At these meetings, members discuss vaccine research and scientific data related to effectiveness and safety, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease, vaccine supply, combined medicines, inoculations for teens and many other topics. Committee members also participate in work groups, which are active year-round in helping members stay up-to-date on vaccines and their safety.\nThe committee continually evaluates and re-evaluates the science of vaccines -- everything from timing and spacing of doses to storage and handling. \nAlternative schedules leave out some shots, spread them over a longer period of time or both.\nDelaying vaccines does not offer any known benefits to children, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (PDF). In fact, one study found that a serious side effect -- seizure -- is more common when the measles shot is delayed. \nSpreading out shots only leaves a child at risk for a longer period of time, according to the academy. In the meantime, a serious case of vaccine-preventable illness could lead to hospitalization.\nA recent study (PDF) found that nearly 88% of pediatricians said they receive a request each day to delay a vaccine. These doctors believe that parents delay due to fears that too many vaccines will burden their child's immune system. \nYet babies and children are exposed to many new germs every day just by playing, eating and breathing. Vaccine experts say (PDF) a child's immune system must martial a greater response to fight off daily germs than any combination of vaccines on the vaccination schedule.\nPediatricians also report that 8.6% of their parents (PDF), concerned about safety or believing it unnecessary, refuse at least one vaccine. Again, vaccines are safe and necessary to continue a disease-free nation.\nMyths linger around vaccines and autism. A 1998 study that linked vaccines to autism was retracted by the British medical journal The Lancet, and the lead author of the paper lost his medical license. Another British medical journal concluded that the original study misrepresented or altered the medical histories of all 12 of the patients whose cases formed the basis of the study.\nSome worry too about a preservative called thimerosal, which contained a very low concentration of a mercury compound. Children hardly get thimerosal in vaccines: The Food and Drug Administration stopped issuing licenses for children's vaccines that use the preservative in 2001; a trace amount is still in some children's flu vaccines. Still, among many studies, none shows a correlation with autism or other serious side effects, the FDA says.\nVaccines, like any medicine, may cause side effects, but most are usually minor and short-lived. For example, after being given a shot, some children will complain that their arms feel sore or experience a mild fever. \nSerious reactions can also happen, but they are extremely rare.\n\"You are 100 times more likely to be struck by lightning than to have a serious allergic reaction to the vaccine that protects you against measles,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. \"Studies, including a meta analysis of 1.2 million children in 2014, show no link between vaccines and autism.\"\nSome of the diseases prevented by vaccines are nonexistent in America. But the reason many diseases are no longer common in this country -- though they continue to spread in other places -- is because of widespread vaccination programs.\nAny child who is not fully vaccinated can become seriously sick if exposed to a disease. Even if you and your child never travel to a place where a vaccine-preventable disease is common, a child can come into contact with an international traveler. Unvaccinated, children can become seriously ill if exposed.\nSome parents say they prefer to build a child's natural immunity rather than getting a vaccine to  prevent a disease. Natural immunity usually refers to two separate experiences.\nDuring the last few weeks of pregnancy, fetuses develop temporary immunity from their mothers, and breastfeeding protects babies from minor infections temporarily. However, this natural protection does not last long, leaving a baby vulnerable to disease.\nNatural immunity also occurs when a child becomes sick and then recovers. With most childhood illnesses, such as chicken pox, children who suffer through the disease build immune system defenses that protect them from getting sick again from the same illness. \nAlthough this natural defense is stronger than vaccine defense, it's risky to expose your children to illness in the hopes of them developing natural immunity. \nFirst, you cannot control the severity of illness. Measles, for example, can lead to pneumonia, lifelong brain damage and deafness. Between 2001 and 2013, 28% of children who had the measles when younger than 5 had to be hospitalized, according to the CDC. \nSecond, your child may spread their illness to vulnerable people, such as infants and those with compromised immune systems. \n","42":"Minnesota's Somali community has seen an uptick in vaccine resistance due to fears of a link to autism, she said. Research shows that any side effects from vaccines are rare, and there is no evidence that vaccines cause autism.\n\"Usually, states will see one or two cases in a year, and what's concerning is, as of today, we'll be at 48 cases of measles,\" Ehresmann said of Minnesota. \n\"The most worrisome thing is, it's a completely unnecessary outbreak,\" she said. \"We have a vaccine that can prevent measles, and yet we're seeing this widespread transmission.\"\nSkepticism around vaccines in Minnesota's Somali community, the largest Somali community in the United States, emerged in 2008. \nThat's when parents started to notice a disproportionate number of Somali children receiving special education services for autism in Minneapolis, which is in Hennepin County, Ehresmann said.\n\"At that point, the anti-vaccine groups just really started targeting the community,\" she said.\nThen, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination rates began to plummet. \n\"Between 2000 and roughly 2008, the Somali community in Minnesota actually had some of the highest vaccination rates for 2-year-olds of any population in the state,\" said Michael Osterholm, regents professor and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and a former state epidemiologist for Minnesota.\nAs parents searched for answers as to why some Somali children were diagnosed with autism, they landed upon the work of discredited British researcher Andrew Wakefield, who first proposed a link between vaccines and autism in a paper later found to be fraudulent, Osterholm said.\nAt the same time, local anti-vaccination activists started to hold meetings in the community, he said.\n\"So, by about 2008, we started to see the vaccine rates drop as the word got through the Somali community that autism was linked to measles vaccination,\" he said. \"In the years since then, Andrew Wakefield has actually been brought in several times to the Somali community here in Minnesota to actually give presentations supporting this information. ... His work has been retracted.\"\nThree years later, a University of Minnesota research project investigated whether there was a higher prevalence of autism in Somali children who live in Minneapolis versus non-Somali children in Minneapolis. The project included data on children who were 7 to 9 years old in 2010.\nThe researchers found Somali and white children in Minneapolis to be equally likely to be identified with autism, and both groups were more likely to be identified with autism than non-Somali black and Hispanic children.\nMeanwhile, a precipitous dropoff in vaccination coverage still continued among children of Somali descent, Ehresmann said.\nOsterholm said that a measles outbreak hit the Somali community in Minnesota in 2011. Though it was smaller than the current outbreak, it was largely associated with children not being vaccinated, he said.\n\"Measles finds unvaccinated people, and this outbreak has two key points,\" Ehresmann said. \"One is the effect of targeted misinformation on a vulnerable community, but the other is that if you're not vaccinated, you are vulnerable.\" \nHealth officials in Minnesota offered MMR vaccination recommendations last week in response to the recent outbreak of the measles virus. The vaccine is typically given to children in two doses: at 12 months and then at 4 to 6 years old.\nHowever, for children who have had one dose of the MMR vaccine and live in counties where measles cases have been identified, officials recommend that they get their second dose as soon as possible if their first was received at least 28 days ago.\nAll Somali Minnesotan children who received their first dose at least 28 days ago should do the same, according to officials. Additionally, health care providers statewide may recommend an early second dose during routine appointments for children.\nHealth officials recommended that all children 12 months and older who have not received a MMR vaccine should receive a first dose as soon as possible. It was also recommended that adults born in 1957 or later, who have not received a vaccine and have never had measles, should do the same.\nAs health officials continue to investigate where measles exposure may occur and who might have been exposed, guidelines have been released for health care professionals to help minimize measles transmission in Minnesota.\n\"Measles is a serious disease. You can have pneumonia and dehydration ... and people do die from measles, so we take it very seriously,\" Ehresmann said. \n\"Our goal for measles control is to protect all the individuals in the state, but for some people, they can't be vaccinated because of health conditions,\" she said. \"There is some level of concern about those individuals, and if this outbreak keeps spreading, that just increases the likelihood that there may be individuals who are in high risk or have high-risk conditions that will be affected.\"\nOsterholm compared the outbreak to a forest fire.\n\"Measles is by far one of the most infectious of all the infectious disease agents we deal with,\" he said. \"If you get a major outbreak started in a community, like the Somali-Americans, the sparks fly out of that fire and then start forest fires around the state, and that's what we're concerned about today.\"\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says measles \"is so contagious that if one person has it, 90% of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected.\"\nAlthough measles is still common in many parts of the world -- including countries in Europe, Asia and Africa -- the disease was eliminated in the US in 2000, according to the CDC. \n\"So the cases that we see are cases that are imported or brought in from other countries, at this point,\" Ehresmann said. \"You just don't know when it's going to happen.\"\nIn recent years,  cases in the United States have quickly spread among those who have not been vaccinated.\nIn 2015, a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland spread among those who were not vaccinated against the virus. A 2013 measles outbreak spread at a Texas-based megachurch whose pastor had preached against children getting vaccinations.\n\"We shouldn't be spending hundreds of thousands of public health dollars to battle an outbreak that doesn't need to be,\" Ehresmann said. \"We collectively can prevent these things from happening by vaccinating.\"\n","43":"Do vaccines cause autism? Over\u00c2\u00a0the past few\u00c2\u00a0decades, a considerable amount of research has emerged, published in various peer-reviewed journals, declaring the need to look into this further.\u00c2\u00a0Some\u00c2\u00a0have said definitively that\u00c2\u00a0there is a considerable risk for autism, or autism-like features and other neurodegenerative diseases, while others claim, just as definitively that\u00c2\u00a0vaccines do not cause autism whatsoever.\nOne thing is for certain \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the masses are unaware\u00c2\u00a0of the research showing a link\u00c2\u00a0between vaccines and autism, and in fact, many still do not believe\u00c2\u00a0that this type of research even exists. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a considerable amount of pro-vaccine marketing, and the media heavily stigmatizes anyone who questions\u00c2\u00a0their safety.\nThe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccines Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Cause Autism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Side\nThose who believe that vaccines don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause autism will commonly point to the science, usually citing\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0government health authorities, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which state that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153studies have shown that there is no link between vaccines and developing ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder)\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that adverse reactions are rare.\nMost of the studies debunking the vaccine-autism link come from the CDC\u00c2\u00a0itself. For example, a study they conducted in 2013 examined the substances and microbes in vaccines that trigger the immune system to react with antibodies that fight disease (antigens). They looked at these antigens in two-year-olds and concluded that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the total amount of antigen from vaccines received was the same between children with ASD and those that did not have ASD. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\nWhen it comes to vaccine ingredients, like mercury, the CDC commonly cites a study from 2004, stating that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the evidence favours rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Several conflicts of interest were noted in this study regarding the authors, but were not disclosed.\nAnd more evidence is emerging. One of the lead authors of these studies, a senior scientist at the CDC who has published multiple studies heavily cited by the CDC debunking a link between mercury, the MRR vaccine, and autism (Thompson,  et al. 2007,\u00c2\u00a0Price, et al. 2010,\u00c2\u00a0Destefano, et al. 2004), Dr. William Thompson, came out publicly stating that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the lowest point\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in his career when he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153went along with [the]\u00c2\u00a0paper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that debunked this link. He went on to say that he and the other authors \u00e2\u20ac\u0153didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t report significant findings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153completely ashamed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of what he did.\nThompson was involved in\u00c2\u00a0studies between 2003 and 2012, when the CDC funded or conducted approximately 10 studies that found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD, as well as no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MR) vaccine and ASD in children.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nWhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more,\u00c2\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy\u00c2\u00a0Jr.\u00c2\u00a0recently issued a challenge to journalists and scientists, offering a $100,000 dollar reward to anybody who can provide a study showing that it is safe to inject mercury into babies, while himself offering\u00c2\u00a0approximately 100 studies showing that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not. Most people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that vaccine adjuvants have simply been assumed safe, without any toxicology studies to prove it. This is precisely why Kennedy and his team are taking this initiative.\nLastly, another way the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccination does not cause ASD\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd argument is defended is by discrediting research that demonstrates a link. These types of papers come under severe scrutiny, and some have been retracted and even ridiculed despite being backed by many researchers. One of the most recent cases involved a paper titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Behavioural abnormalities in young female mice following administration of aluminum adjuvants and the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that found strong evidence for neuroinflammation and autoimmune reactions.\nThe ironic part is that research showing a link is commonly discredited, even though those from within the field have been discrediting most \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmainstream\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 science. The editors in chiefs of some of the\u00c2\u00a0most prestigious medical journals in the world, like Dr. Richard Horton, Dr. Arnold Seymour Relman, and\u00c2\u00a0Dr. Marcia Angell, have all emphasized how a very large percentage of research is corrupted\u00c2\u00a0by political and industry interests.\nIf vaccines and autism aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t connected, ask yourself, why are so many professionals, scientists, and doctors convinced otherwise? Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a look.\nWatch Free: Groundbreaking documentary series exploring The Truth About Vaccines\nThe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccines Cause Autism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Side\nAs mentioned earlier, there are a number of studies implicating vaccines and autism, and more\u00c2\u00a0seem to surface every single year. According to\u00c2\u00a0Dr. Lucija Tomlijenovic, PhD., a post-doctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia where she works in neurosciences and the Department of Medicine:\nConsider the following\u00c2\u00a0meta-analysis that was published in the journal\u00c2\u00a0Bio Med Research\u00c2\u00a0International:\nThe studies on which the [pro-mercury vaccine] CDC relies on and over which it exerted some level of control report that there is no increased risk of autism from exposure to organic Hg in vaccines, and some of these studies even reported that exposure to Thimerosal appeared to decrease the risk of autism.\nThese six studies are in sharp contrast to research conducted by independent researchers over the past 75+ years that have consistently found Thimerosal to be harmful. As mentioned in the Introduction section, many studies conducted by independent investigators have found Thimerosal to be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.\nWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also seeing the same thing right now with aluminum, another substance that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been viewed as non-toxic by the FDA and by vaccine manufacturers. This determination means no appropriate studies have been undertaken to prove its safety.\nYet a\u00c2\u00a0growing number of studies have linked the use of aluminum adjuvants to serious autoimmune outcomes in humans. (source)(source)(source)(source) The use of this adjuvant has\u00c2\u00a0been\u00c2\u00a0connected\u00c2\u00a0to all kinds of diseases, from autism to brain disease to Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and much more.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Experimental research\u00c2\u00a0. . .\u00c2\u00a0clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0 Dr. Lucija Tomlijenovic ( source )\nThere are numerous studies that have examined aluminum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential to induce toxic effects, and this is clearly established in medical literature, and has been for a long time. (source)\nPerhaps one of the biggest pieces of evidence to emerge within the past few years, as mentioned earlier, comes\u00c2\u00a0from\u00c2\u00a0senior CDC scientist and whistleblower Dr. William Thompson (author of multiple CDC studies debunking a vaccine-autism link). Not only did he admit to falsifying data\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the order of his superiors at the CDC, he also transferred concealed data to his colleague,\u00c2\u00a0Dr. Brian Hooker.\nHooker is one of the authors of the mercury meta-analysis listed above, and he ia\u00c2\u00a0also a long-time CDC scientists who took that data shortly after the Thompson incident and published a report in 2014 in the peer-reviewed journal\u00c2\u00a0 Translational Neurodegeneration.\u00c2\u00a0It found a\u00c2\u00a0340% increased risk of autism in African American boys receiving the Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine on time. The study was\u00c2\u00a0 retracted during the same time of this controversy.\nApart from the science aspect, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccines cause autism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 camp also cites scientific fraud, but has actual documents to prove it. \u00c2\u00a0For example, a leaked report from GlaxoSmithKline \u00e2\u20ac\u0153details adverse effects associated with autism, including encephalitis, developmental delays, altered states of consciousness, speech delays and other adverse reactions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThere are also documents revealing that vaccine manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and health authorities have known about multiple dangers associated with vaccines but chose to withhold them from the public. They show\u00c2\u00a0that health authorities and vaccine manufacturers made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continuous efforts to withhold critical data on severe adverse reactions and contraindications to vaccinations to both parents and health practitioners in order to reach overall vaccination rates, which they deemed were necessary for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcherd immunity.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (source)\nThere is a powerful and brand new documentary series you can watch for free \u00c2\u00a0titled The Truth About Vaccines, which brings together an impressive line up of experts who will explore this subject. You\u00c2\u00a0can learn more about here.\nThe details above are just the tip of the iceberg. Whether autism is connected to vaccination or not is an issue that clearly requires closer scrutiny and in-depth analysis.\u00c2\u00a0It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to\u00c2\u00a0make\u00c2\u00a0all of the evidence available to the public\u00c2\u00a0and have a serious discussion between experts on both sides of the coin.\nRelated CE Article: The Top 6 Reasons Why Parents Should Never Be Forced To Vaccinate Their Children\n","44":"The gasping breath and distinctive sounds of whooping cough; the iron lungs and braces designed for children paralyzed by                   polio; and the devastating birth defects caused by rubella: To most Americans, these infectious scourges simultaneously inspire                   dread and represent obscure maladies of years past. Yet a little more than a century ago, the U.S. infant mortality rate was                   a staggering 20 percent, and the childhood mortality rate before age five was another disconcerting 20 percent.1 Not surprisingly, in an epoch before the existence of preventive methods and effective therapies, infectious diseases such                   as measles, diphtheria, smallpox, and pertussis topped the list of childhood killers. Fortunately, many of these devastating                   diseases have been contained, especially in industrialized nations, because of the development and widespread distribution                   of safe, effective, and affordable vaccines.                \nIndeed, if you asked a public health professional to draw up a top-ten list of the achievements of the past century, he or                   she would be hard pressed not to rank immunization first.2 Millions of lives have been saved and microbes stopped in their tracks before they could have a chance to wreak havoc. In                   short, the vaccine represents the single greatest promise of biomedicine: disease prevention.3\nNevertheless, the story is more complicated than it might appear at first glance. Even as existing vaccines continue to exert                   their immunological power and new vaccines offer similar hopes, reemerging and newly emerging infectious diseases threaten                   the dramatic progress made. Furthermore, obstacles have long stood in the way of the production of safe and effective vaccines.                   The historical record shows that the development of vaccines has consistently involved sizable doses of ingenuity, political                   skill, and irreproachable scientific methods. When one or more of these has been lacking or perceived to be lacking, vaccination                   has engendered responses ranging from a revised experimental approach in the laboratory to a supply shortage and even insurrection                   in the streets. In short, vaccines are powerful medical interventions that induce powerful biological, social, and cultural                   reactions.                \nWe begin our history of vaccines and immunization with the story of Edward Jenner, a country doctor living in Berkeley (Gloucestershire),                      England, who in 1796 performed the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first vaccination.4 Taking pus from a cowpox lesion on a milkmaid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand, Jenner inoculated an eight-year-old boy, James Phipps. Six weeks later                      Jenner variolated two sites on Phipps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arm with smallpox, yet the boy was unaffected by this as well as subsequent exposures.5 Based on twelve such experiments and sixteen additional case histories he had collected since the 1770s, Jenner published                      at his own expense a volume that swiftly became a classic text in the annals of medicine: Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccine. His assertion \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that the cow-pox protects the human constitution from the infection of smallpox\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd laid the foundation for modern                      vaccinology.6\nHow did Jenner, a country doctor, formulate the vaccine concept? To begin with, his discovery relied extensively on knowledge                      of the local customs of farming communities and the awareness that milkmaids infected with cowpox, visible as pustules on                      the hand or forearm, were immune to subsequent outbreaks of smallpox that periodically swept through the area. Moreover, a                      learned man immersed in the secular and rational doctrines of the Enlightenment, Jenner applied the scientific methods of                      observation and experimentation to this parochial wisdom, ultimately conducting one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first clinical trials.                      He thus was able to devise an alternative to variolation (the controlled transfer of pus from one person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s active smallpox                      lesion to another person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arm, usually subcutaneously with a lancet), which had been practiced in Asia since the 1600s and                      in Europe and colonial America since the early 1700s.7\nJenner also profited from his training as a wide-ranging generalist with a broad knowledge of science and medicine. For example,                      before devoting himself to private practice, Jenner focused on natural history, penning well-respected studies of the cuckoo                      and the dormouse.8 In fact, Jenner was so skilled a naturalist that he was invited (although he declined) to join Captain Cook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second voyage                      to the South Seas to classify flora and fauna.                   \nJenner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest in natural history and animal biology sharpened his medical understanding of the role of human-animal trans-species                      boundaries in disease transmission. He experienced the proverbial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eureka\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd-like moment sometime during the 1770s, after hearing                      a Bristol milkmaid boast, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I shall never have smallpox for I have had cowpox. I shall never have an ugly pockmarked face.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd9 Two decades later he translated that farming lore into the guiding principle of his cowpox inoculation hypothesis. His cognizance                      that animals were implicated and necessary for vaccine production was truly prescient; it foreshadowed later use of cows,                      guinea pigs, rabbits, and even chicken eggs in vaccine production. However, this breach of the species barrier also made many                      people wary of and sometimes hostile to the idea of consciously introducing foreign animal products into their own bodies.                      During the early 1800s, for example, there was no shortage of cartoons mocking Jenner and depicting the transmogrification                      of the recently vaccinated into sickly cows and fantastical beasts.10\nEven though vaccination and immunization are often used interchangeably, especially in nonmedical parlance, the latter is a more inclusive term because it implies                         that the administration of an immunologic agent actually results in the development of adequate immunity.                      \nSince Jenner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s discovery, governments have often invested, albeit unevenly and incompletely, in vaccines. Initially vaccines                         were considered a matter of national pride and prestige. They quickly became integral to utilitarian and public health notions                         of societal security, productivity, and protection. In Europe and North America during the nineteenth century, for instance,                         smallpox vaccination was made compulsory under state laws. In the twentieth century, as the standard battery of childhood                         immunizations, including diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella, was developed, vaccination was frequently managed or adjudicated                         by governmental entities (from the municipal to the federal) and eventually was required for public school attendance.                      \nAfter the founding of the World Health Organization (WHO) and related organizations such as the United Nations Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s                         Fund (UNICEF), vaccine programs went global. In 1974, for example, the WHO launched the Expanded Programme on Immunization                         (EPI), with the goal of dramatically increasing vaccination rates among children in developing countries. For more than three                         decades the EPI has functioned through the WHO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional offices to meet target immunization rates for almost every disease                         with a corresponding immunologic agent.18 Perhaps the WHO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most spectacular achievement was the smallpox campaign of the 1960s and 1970s. Directed by Donald Henderson,                         this massive effort culminated in the last naturally occurring case of smallpox in Somalia in 1977.19 Today this example of success serves as a beacon of encouragement for international health workers involved in ongoing and                         challenging immunization campaigns against polio, measles, and other diseases. For more than fifty years, similar efforts\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth                         immunization campaigns and vaccine trails\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhave been supported by global health organizations and major philanthropies such                         as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.20\nIronically, as vaccines have become more commonplace, they have lost some of their allure, particularly to public funding                         agencies. One might argue that vaccines have worked so well that many people now take them for granted. In this sense, scientific                         success has paradoxically contributed to the current problems with adequate funding mechanisms. In a similar twist, the triumph                         of the polio vaccine in 1955 fostered the idea that it was possible to obtain sufficient funding without the primary support                         of government, instead relying on contributions from philanthropic groups (the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis                         or March of Dimes) and the pocketbooks of millions of Americans.21\nIdeally, the migration of vaccine production away from governmental entities, as seen in the nineteenth century, and increasingly                         into commercial hands could result in the positive benefits of competition, superior production, and lower cost.22 Sadly, this has not been the case. Today, many pharmaceutical companies avoid the vaccine business because it is economically                         prohibitive and encumbered by regulatory barriers.23 For example, in 1998 Warner Lambert (now Pfizer) stopped making Fluogen vaccine for influenza because of regulatory obstacles                         and financial loss. It sold its Fluogen factory to King Pharmaceuticals, which soon threw in the towel after determining that                         bringing its new plant into federal compliance was too costly. Clearly, this pattern greatly contributed to the fall 2004                         flu vaccine shortage in the United States.24 The situation is similar for the ten basic childhood vaccines, the majority of which, including measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)                         and chickenpox vaccines, are manufactured by just one company.25\nThe critical questions to ask are: If this company experiences a business or sudden production failure, how would we vaccinate                         millions of American children; and what backup plans do we have in case of such an event? To avoid this scenario, in 2003                         the National Vaccine Advisory Board listed an increase in funds for vaccine stockpiles at the top of its list of recommendations.26 Nevertheless, capital infusions have not been immediately forthcoming from either the public or the private sector. Given                         our current predicament, we could learn a great deal from the enthusiastic financial support granted to Jenner and early smallpox                         vaccination efforts. Although royal patronage is no longer an option, financial incentives, whether through tax relief or                         guaranteed purchase, may be needed to ensure an adequate and steady vaccine supply.                      \nJenner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial experiments were carried out in a pre\u00e2\u20ac\u201cgerm theory era that lacked modern methods of quality control and sterilization.                      Hence, the prospect of contamination constantly loomed over smallpox vaccine development, and many people were rightly wary                      of contracting another dread disease via inoculation. With a method that often involved extracting lymph from pustules on                      the arms of those recently vaccinated, it was not uncommon for existing microorganisms to accompany the vaccine from arm to                      arm, spreading diseases such as erysipelas, syphilis, and scrofula.27\nUnlike most drugs, which are essentially chemical agents, vaccines are biologic agents that can be compromised during processing.                      Whether killed-virus, whole-cell, bacterial, or live-attenuated, vaccines can be disrupted at various points along the journey                      from the laboratory to the vial. Not surprisingly, quality control, sterilization, and monitoring have become non-negotiable                      for vaccine production. Even with strict standards, however, the possibility of contamination remains (even though it is far                      less likely today than several decades ago). In addition, vaccine production must be closely supervised to ensure that vaccines                      induce immunity and do not produce serious infection. For example, the optimism about the polio vaccine in spring 1955 was                      temporarily muted after 200 children contracted disease (fatal for five children) from a vaccine containing active wild-type                      polio virus that was manufactured by Cutter Laboratories in California.28\nDebates over virulence, killed versus live virus, and antigenic strains have played a critical role in setting the parameters                      of the production and manufacture of safe and effective vaccines for more than one hundred years. The controversy between                      Jonas Salk, who advocated a killed polio vaccine, and Albert Sabin, who preferred a live polio vaccine, characterizes this                      divide, although there are many more examples.29 For instance, as measles immunization was becoming widely accepted in the United States in the 1960s, a formalin-inactivated                      vaccine licensed in 1963 was withdrawn because it induced short-lived immunity and predisposed recipients to atypical measles                      syndrome if they were exposed to the wild-type measles virus. Ultimately safe and reliable vaccines were developed from the                      original Edmonston B strain (initially isolated by John Enders and Thomas Peebles in human and monkey cell cultures in 1954).30 One of these attenuated vaccines, the Moraten strain, is the only measles vaccine used in the United States today, while                      two additional strains\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe Schwarz and Edmonston-Zagreb\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare employed in worldwide immunization campaigns against a disease                      that infects approximately thirty million children per year, killing approximately 750,000 of them.31 In the case of BCG (bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00c3\u00a9rin) vaccination against tuberculosis, developed in France in 1921, concerns about                      efficacy and safety led to very different patterns of vaccine acceptance. In Scandinavia, BCG was mass-distributed as part                      of the emergence of a comprehensive social welfare program. Conversely, in the United States and Britain, acceptance was much                      slower because of greater confidence in the long-term benefits of tuberculosis testing and treatment and apprehension that                      mass BCG vaccination might misconstrue the results of mass-scale tuberculin Mantoux PPD (purified protein derivative) testing                      by delivering large numbers of false positives.32\nEspecially in the 1830s, after an initial generation had been vaccinated and the incidence of smallpox had declined markedly                      in the United States and Europe, a vociferous antivaccination movement emerged.33 Sometimes antivaccinationists were protesting what they considered the intrusion of their privacy and bodily integrity. Many                      working-class Britons, for example, viewed compulsory vaccination laws, passed in 1821, as a direct government assault on                      their communities by the ruling class.34 In addition, by the mid-eighteenth century the rise of irregular medicine and unabashed quackery encouraged antivaccinationism.                      For instance, irregulars generally viewed vaccination as a destructive and potentially defiling procedure of heroic medicine,                      akin to blood-letting.35 In addition, antivivisectionists, who abhorred animal experimentation, sometimes joined forces with antivaccinationists.36\nTo a great extent, nation-states responded by articulating that they possessed the right to immunize for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153common good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd                      In 1905, for example, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Jacobson v. Massachusetts that the need to protect the public health through compulsory smallpox vaccination outweighed the individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right to privacy.37 Barring exceptions for religious belief, which exist in all but two U.S. states, this tenet has been consistently reiterated                      and is lent scientific muster by the concept of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whereby a certain target of the population\u00e2\u20ac\u201dapproximately                      85\u00e2\u20ac\u201c95 percent, depending on the disease\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmust be immunized for protection to be conferred upon the entire group.38\nUntil quite recently, historical studies frequently depicted all antivaccinationists as irrational and antiscientific. This                      characterization was misguided. If we interpret antivaccinationists on their own terms and by applying historical context,                      we can see that many behaved as rational actors who were weighing the pros and cons of inoculation. While nineteenth-century                      fears of vaccination might have been based on anecdotal horror stories of other infections, the statistical risks of vaccine-induced                      infection from that era would not be medically acceptable today.                   \nIn addition, many vaccine critics do not reject immunization outright but instead emphasize issues of safety and efficacy                      or are opposed to specific, but not necessarily all, vaccines. The passage of the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act                      (NCVIA), spearheaded by parents troubled by a putative link between vaccination and neurological problems, illustrates that                      legislators and scientists alike continue to be exceedingly concerned with the issue of vaccine safety.39 In the past decade in particular, parents and their watchdog groups have raised important questions about the purported link                      between a noticeable rise in autism and the preservative thimerosal (previously used in diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemo-philus influenzae type b, or Hib, and hepatitis B vaccines). Even though a series of scientific studies have demonstrated that there is no                      causal connection between thimerosal and autism, in 1999 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in conjunction with                      the U.S. Public Health Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics, ceased to license thimerosal-containing vaccines. Similar                      claims about a causal link between MMR and autism have also been alleged and sometimes sensationalized by the media. Not surprisingly,                      the suggestion that vaccinating one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s child might lead to developmental disorders has fostered unease among many parents.                      Clearly, American parents need better access to and clearer explanations of the recent findings published in medical journals                      that confirm the lack of a link between thimerosal or MMR and autism or other neurological conditions.40 However, as indicated by recent political and medical debates about the need for Americans, especially first responders,                      to be vaccinated against smallpox in case of a bioterrorism attack, and the hundreds of Gulf War soldiers who have rejected                      anthrax vaccinations, antivaccinationism will not fade away any time soon.                   \nOur struggle with germs is endless and can be neither completely halted nor assuaged by vaccines, no matter how great their                      immunological power. Sadly, effective vaccines for two of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading killers, HIV and malaria, remain in the research                      stage. Furthermore, even the most knowledgeable scientist cannot precisely predict the strain of next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influenza, nor                      can an expert epidemiologist always explain why certain diseases rise and burn out at particular rates. Molecular biology,                      genomics, and proteomics will certainly reveal a great deal about similar antigens and foster the development of vaccines                      through cellular manipulation rather than animal experimentation.                   \nNevertheless, this historical overview of vaccines and immunization since Jenner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great cowpox discovery suggests that we                      can anticipate several of the key issues that could hinder and complicate the future of vaccinology. Clearly, without adequate                      funding and fluid funding mechanisms, vaccine shortages will persist, and lives throughout the world will remain at risk.                      Closely linked are the issues of vaccine safety and the strict maintenance of sterilization standards. Even as these have                      improved greatly over time, the fact that vaccines are biological agents often makes them much more difficult than drugs to                      produce. Jenner and his peers faced this problem, and history has shown that the production of safe, efficacious vaccines                      will require persistent vigilance. Although antivaccinationists are still often portrayed as an annoying thorn in the side                      of medical progress, their concerns for safety and willingness to perform the duty of civic oversight has had some positive                      effects, especially in terms of popular health education.                   \nAs this paper has shown, there are important continuities in the history of vaccines and immunization. There have been shifts                      as well; unfortunately, one of the most pronounced has been the divestment of public agencies in vaccine research and production.                      If we could match the enormous scientific strides of the twentieth century with the political and economic investments of                      the nineteenth century, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s citizens might be much healthier.                   \n","45":" \t\t\t\t\tOk so our travel agent just told us the recommended vaccines for traveling to Jamaica. I didn't even think of this so now I am wondering how necessary it is. She says it is recommended to get Hep A, Hep B, tetanus, and typhoid. Well my fiance and I both have the vaccines for Hep A and B and tetanus. I don't have the typhoid vaccine, he probably does because he is in the military (but he's not positive). We leave for our honeymoon in about 40 days and we are super busy right now getting everything done for the wedding. Please tell me it's not important to worry about trying to get this injection before our honeymoon! That would be great news to me, mostly because I don't have time and I HATE INJECTIONS!!!!  \t\t\t\t\n \t\t\t\t\tThose are general recommendations not based on your specific travel location, if you are staying in the resort areas no vaccines are necessary. If you were to be spending time in the mountains you would want all those as the water there is not treated and conditions there are very much more \"third world\" and also more rain forest like. I do agree though with all those who recommended the updated tetanus, always a good idea to keep that one up whether travelling or not and we did encounter some glass on the beach due to the recent storms back in October. \t\t\t\t\n","46":"As the Disneyland measles outbreak swells \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0the number of cases in the U.S. has\u00c2\u00a0ticked up to 102 infections in 14 states, most of which link back to the the iconic theme park \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the anti-vaccination community has been having a crisis dialogue within its own\u00c2\u00a0ranks.\u00c2\u00a0\nCalifornia officials have said they\u00c2\u00a0know\u00c2\u00a0the vaccination status of 34 of the 59 people infected in the Disney outbreak, and at least 28 were unvaccinated.

Looking at anti-vaccination and non-vaccination online forums, many on motherhood and pregnancy sites, opinions range from dismissal to anger.

There will always be people who have problems with vaccines, and they will always be ignored or ridiculed. Nothing changes!\nThat being said, I am glad most of those with measles turned out to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unvaxxed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! This is a natural risk non-vaxxers take: we do not vaccinate and (all things being equal) stand a higher chance of getting measles. I take my chances with measles, and it has little effect on a vaccinated person, as the vaccine actually works. High efficacy rates are good for everyone - and takes a lot of the wind out of any herd immunity arguements. You truly can vaccinate and feel relatively certain you will not get mealses. I wish all vaccines were as effective as the measles portion of  MMR.\nWhen it comes to measles, the argument is that the vaccine is effective, therefore everyone needs to be vaxxed to protect the vulnerable. But if the measles vaccine is really that effective, a small group of people turning it down are not going to be able to create a large enough outbreak to cause serious problems, therefore harassing that small group is just being mean, rather than putting public health efforts into areas where they are really needed, like antibiotic failure.\nOriginally I was planning to delay vaccinations for my oldest DS (3 years) but as he got older I felt more comfortable with not getting him any shots until he was substantially older. Now I have a newborn in the house and I have all sorts of fears about my decision. I think my fears are also being fueled by the numerous articles regarding the measles cases in California and the hateful comments people make towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-vax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd parents. Thing is, I would not classify myself as anti-vax. I constantly research and reevaluate my position but I have never had that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ahh I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m now ready to give my oldest his shots\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moment. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m planning on having most of my oldest done before kindergarten but originally I intended on starting them when he was 2.\nDH and I were rolling our eyes at a local news story about this last night. All it said was there are 78 cases traced back to Disneyland and everyone should go get vaxed!! 78 cases. Are any severe? Is anyone even in the hospital? Probably not. My fave part was they of course showed that stock CDC photo of a kid with severe measles (you know the one, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all seen it), just to scare some people into vaxxing. Never mind how many of these cases are in vaxed people\nOf course the media takes opportunities like this to blow up any new topic. Just like Ebola was the main topic for a couple months and now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dead. But I keep seeing these horrifically judgmental headlines about the measles being started by a non-vaxxed person. Is there actually proof to this claim? Or is this the media\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way of another vax scare tactic? It has me doing new research of my part since my son is not vaxxed but I think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still at the conclusion that the MMR vax scares me more than measles do. Maybe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m completely naive, maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not close enough to home but I honestly feel like the media Is once again dramatizing the situation and using it to bully and scare the non-vaxers.\u00c2\u00a0\nHow can there ever be a truly reasonable, peaceful discussion on the topic when the vast majority of news outlets blatantly push a particular agenda? There is virtually no balanced reporting. Dissenting views are ridiculed as quackery.\nI really think society doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know the truth, they cant handle the truth,fear is what drives the normalcy of their lives. Like the above comment says, people would be in panic and have no sense of control over their lives if they found out that their children were truly harmed by a vaccine that their trusted Dr. and Government reassured them that was safe and then have their 2 month old child die of S.I.D.S. shortly after. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safer to not know the truth, but when one seeks the truth,it will be found\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a selective vaxer and I revealed that in pro-vaxers FB thread yesterday that I know personally, the lack of information and immaturity that ensued was crazy. I was told non-vaxers follow junk science and base their decisions from Jenny McCarthy and Kristin Cavalleri. I posted vaccine incidence rate from AAP for MMR and the vaccine injury website from the government. No response to that just blatant dismissal and disregard with reference to public health. And honestly, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m too chicken to not vaccinate my daughter but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m selective and prioritized a schedule that worked for us.\n","47":"         Rabies Vaccines: Safer Ways To Vaccinate Your Dog\n                           10720 Shares\nShare  \nTweet  \nShare  \nPin  \n\n\n\n\n   \n\n Subscribe \nDNM Products \nDNM Blog \nThe Magazine About Dogs Naturally \nAdvertising \nBusiness Directory \nWholesale Accounts \nGiveaways \nFrequently Asked Questions \nCareers \nWrite For Dogs Naturally \nContact Us \n\n\nStore \nLog In \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n Follow @@dogsnaturally\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n   \n\n\n    \n http:\/\/pinterest.com\/dogsnaturally  \n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n     \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t Recent Posts \n\n \n\n   Holistic Vets Explain: Natural Treatment Of Cancer In Dogs  \n\n \n\n   Dangerous Over-Vaccination Is On The Rise  \n\n \n\n   [Updated] How To Balance The Calcium And Phosphorus In Your Dog's Raw Diet  \n\n \n\n   What Every Vet (And Pet Owner) Should Know About Vaccines  \n\n \n\n   I Wouldn't Give My Dog This New Allergy Drug  \n\n \n\n   Preventing And Treating Worms In Dogs  \n\n\n\n  \nRabies Vaccination: 13 Ways to Vaccinate More Safely\n  Vaccine Articles and News\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \/\n By\t\t\t\t\t Jan Rasmusen\t\t\t\t\t \n\n 10720 Shares     \n\n\n \nAnimal Control sends a notice stating that your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rabies vaccination is due.\nSome of us will vaccinate readily.\nBecause it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legally mandated, it must be safe, right? Besides, what choice do we have?\nOthers of us panic, desperate to avoid the shot at any cost. We\u00c2\u00a0remember what happened the last time our dog had a rabies vaccination. We wonder, will our dog survive another?\nWorld renowned pet vaccination scientist, Dr Jean Dodds, wrote recently: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rabies vaccines are the most common group of biological products identified in adverse event reports received by the USDA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAn adverse reaction to a rabies vaccine may exact a high price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health and your wallet. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you need to know to make vaccinating your dog safer:\n1. Learn to recognize adverse reactions\nShort-term reactions include vomiting, facial swelling, fever, lethargy, circulatory shock, loss of consciousness and even death. (If your pet appears distressed, contact your vet immediately.) Reactions occurring days or months after vaccination can be difficult to recognize. They include:\nFibrocarcinomas (cancer) at the injection site\nSeizures and epilepsy\nAutoimmune disease\nChronic digestive problems\nAllergies\nSkin diseases\nMuscle weakness or atrophy\nPica (eating inappropriate materials, including feces)\nBehavioral changes (aggression, separation anxiety, compulsive behaviors and more)\n\nIf you suspect a health or behavior problem may be connected to a vaccine, you may have to convince your vet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s common to hear \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the shot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a reaction like that is impossible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Even the drug\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturer (to whom you should immediately report the reaction \u00e2\u20ac\u201d giving them the\u00c2\u00a0brand and lot# \u00e2\u20ac\u201d may deny the connection. Insist on seeing the product\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s package insert,\u00c2\u00a0 viewable on-line or from your vet. Also know that long-term reactions aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually documented or even studied. Note: a vaccine reaction, especially one supported by your vet, may entitle you to compensation for medical expenses from the drug manufacturer.\n [icegram messages=\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd19010\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3]2. Vaccinate healthy dogs only\nVaccinating an unhealthy animal can exacerbate illness and do irreparable harm. Also, immunity may not develop\u00c2\u00a0after vaccination because of the dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compromised immune system. This is especially dangerous as you may\u00c2\u00a0presume\u00c2\u00a0immunity that does not\u00c2\u00a0exist.\u00c2\u00a0Pets with autoimmune disease or cancer are obviously \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not healthy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but neither are pets suffering from stress from a move or surgery, a virus or infection, or allergies or skin problems or any other condition compromising health. (Never allow your pet to be vaccinated during surgery.)\n3. Ask for a rabies vaccination exemption\nIf your dog has documented health problems, ask your vet to apply for a rabies vaccination extension or exemption. Many localities permit them even if state law doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t specifically allow them. If your vet won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apply for an exemption, go elsewhere. You may want to contact a holistic vet who may better understand the dangers of vaccinating an unhealthy animal. If local law forbids exemptions, change the law. Numerous states are in the process of adding exemptions to their laws. Click this link to check your state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rabies law and pending exemptions.\n4. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate against rabies within three weeks of other vaccinations or medication for parasites\nMultiple vaccines given at once greatly\u00c2\u00a0increase the chance of reactions.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Multiple vaccines are especially risky for small dogs.\n5. Make sure your dog gets the correct vaccine\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re vaccinating a puppy, make sure your vet administers a one-year vaccine initially (as late as legally possible) and a three-year vaccine (or whatever is required in your area) thereafter. The one-year and three-year vaccines are virtually identical medically \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not under the law.\u00c2\u00a0 A one-year shot must be followed by re-vaccination a year later. Note: the one-year shot is not safer than the three-year\u00c2\u00a0(except that it may contain fewer adjuvants).\n6. Vaccinate at the safest time\nVaccinate in the morning, early in the week, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave the area for at least an hour if possible. Watch for reactions for at least the next 48 hours. Reactions\u00c2\u00a0occurring when the closest vet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office is closed can prove disastrous, even fatal.\n7. Tell your vet you want a Thimerosol-free vaccine\nThimerosol (mercury) in vaccines has been linked to adverse reactions. Merial, for one, makes one- and three-year thimersol-free rabies vaccines: IMRAB\u00c2\u00ae 1 TF and IMRAB\u00c2\u00ae 3 TF. Make sure you see \u00e2\u20ac\u0153TF\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the label. (If your vet doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carry the vaccine, you may have to vet shop to find the vaccine you want.\u00c2\u00a0 You might also ask why the vet why he\/she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carry it.)\n8. Find a vet trained in homeopathy to vaccinate your dog\nCertain homeopathic remedies given before, during and after vaccinating\u00c2\u00a0can lessen the chance of ill effects from vaccination. Click the link to find vet referral lists.\n9. Report all vaccine reactions to your vet\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and make sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re recorded in your pet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s file. Have the vet sign relevant pages, get copies and put them in a safe place. (Vets lose records, retire and move away.) Also report the reaction to the drug\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturer. (You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need the vaccine lot number.) Vets are notoriously bad at reporting reactions, but exemptions to rabies vaccination\u00c2\u00a0and drug safety require documentation.\n10. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate within a week of travel\nPets experiencing reactions on route can die for lack of immediate medical assistance.\u00c2\u00a0 (Find a list of emergency clinics by area at http:\/\/www.vetsnearyou.com\/ml2\/?v=352875029&u=0880F1AAC5EF9BA40210818080F807184B&gclid=CKOmmcXvm6QCFQY-bAodawLaEg\u00c2\u00a0 (I cannot guarantee the clinics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00c2\u00a0expertise, but at least this is a place to start.)\n11. Keep copies of vaccination records and titer tests in your car\n.. and license tags on your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collar or harness. Otherwise, you may be forced to re-vaccinate if your pet bites someone, runs away and is taken to a shelter or if you have to board your pet unexpectedly.\n12. Do not administer a rabies vaccine yourself\nIt will not satisfy legal requirements and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to have a vet vaccinate again. You\u00c2\u00a0will also be unprepared to deal with a potentially life-threatening reaction.\u00c2\u00a0 Similarly, a vet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office\u00c2\u00a0may likely be\u00c2\u00a0a safer place to get the vaccine than a mobile clinic.\n13. Finally, support the Rabies Challenge Fund.\nWorld renowned scientists, W Jean Dodds DVM and Ronald D Schultz PhD are working as volunteers to increase the interval between rabies boosters by proving that the vaccine gives immunity, first, for five years, and then for seven years. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also working to establish a blood \u00e2\u20ac\u0153titer standard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to provide a scientific basis to avoid unnecessary boosters with a simple blood test. This nonprofit group is supported solely by dog lovers and dog groups.\nBefore the next notice from Animal Control arrives, do your homework. A little time spent learning about the rabies vaccine can mean the difference between your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wellness and serious illness.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n \n\n\n About the Author\t\t\tJan Rasmusen \nJan Rasmusen is the national award-winning author of Scared Poopless: The Straight Scoop on Dog Care and consumer advocate for dog lovers.

And despite what we know about the risks, it seems to be on the rise.\nExperts like leading veterinary immunology researcher Ronald D Schultz PhD proved decades ago that most dogs will be protected for many years (and probably for life) by one round of core vaccines as puppies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c usually when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about 16 weeks old.\nThis table is from Dr Schultz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research on over 1,000 dogs and shows the duration of immunity of the core vaccines from both challenge (exposure to the real virus) and serology (antibody titer results):\nTable 1: Minimum Duration of Immunity for Canine Vaccines\n \nVaccine\n Minimum Duration of Immunity\n Methods Used to Determine Immunity\n \nCORE VACCINES\n \nCanine Distemper Virus (CDV) \nRockbom Strain 7 yrs \/ 15 yrs challenge \/ serology \nOnderstepoort Strain 5 yrs \/ 9 yrs challenge \/ serology \nCanine Adenovirus-2 (CAV-2) 7 yrs \/ 9 yrs challenge-CAV-1 \/ serology \nCanine Parvovirus-2 (CAV-2) 7 yrs challenge \/ serology \n\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\nSo, after their puppy shots, most dogs don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be re-vaccinated ever, let alone year after year after year.\nDr Schultz reports:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The patient receives no benefit and may be placed at serious risk when an unnecessary vaccine is given. Few or no scientific studies have demonstrated a need for cats or dogs to be revaccinated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\nThe World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA), the American Animal\u00c2\u00a0Hospital Association (AAHA), and the American Veterinary Medical Association\u00c2\u00a0(AVMA) have announced publicly that annual vaccination is unnecessary and can be harmful.\nBut they do nothing to stop vets from vaccinating more often than necessary.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nIf your worried your dog is being over vaccinated, we have a free download you can print and bring with you to the vet. It outlines the immunity research by Dr Ronald Schultz\u00c2\u00a0and it will help you and your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s veterinarian come to a healthier vaccination schedule together. Click here to grab the Vaccine Guide now.\nVaccines Are Risky\nIn my years of veterinary practice, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve witnessed hundreds of cases of serious vaccine damage to pets, including death.\nDespite what your veterinarian may tell you about the safety of vaccination, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen it cause dangerous, sometimes deadly, vaccine reactions and lifelong chronic illness \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 including autoimmune diseases and cancer.\nVaccinating annually is an extremely high-risk procedure \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make your dog any more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immune\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from disease.\nYet in the US, about 60% of veterinary clinics completely ignore this research (and their association recommendations) and still push their clients to vaccinate their dogs annually.\nAnd the rapid spread of large veterinary clinic chains is making matters much worse.\u00c2\u00a0 There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reason I call them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shot shacks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAs these corporate chains gobble up independent veterinary clinics, the trend towards over-vaccination is getting worse, not better!\nYou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to think your vet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary concern, above all else, is your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health.\nBut you have to assume profits are the real goal when you read stories like the ones I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m about to share.\n \nGreencross In Australia\nAn Australian holistic veterinarian wrote to me about the Greencross chain of veterinary clinics in her country.\nGreencross owns 132 veterinary clinics and 200 pet specialty retail stores across Australia and the company earns about 725 million Australian dollars (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over half a billion US dollars) a year.\nGreencross is buying up independent veterinary clinics all over the country. In the last six months, they added 17 new vet clinics to their group.\nMy vet friend told me Greencross trains staff \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to sell as much of anything as possible, including annual vaccination.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nYet she was still disturbed to read an article they published recently called The Real Story on Vaccinating Pets.\nThe article starts out complaining that the media has been confusing dog owners by suggesting that dogs only need to be vaccinated every three years \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\nAs the article continues, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that Greencross clinics encourage dog owners to have their pets vaccinated annually for core vaccines (parvo, distemper and hepatitis) as well as bordetella and parainfluenza, using scare tactics like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disease outbreaks of Canine Parvovirus occur on a regular basis throughout Australia.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThey also state their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153philosophy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that pets should be examined twice each year.\nOf course! This gives them more opportunities to sell you extra services.\nDo you think this might be about the money?\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly not about the health of the animals, even though they try to tell you it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to protect your pet from deadly disease.\nIn the UK, pet owners are also being pushed to over-vaccinate their animals, thanks to a devious scheme cooked up by a big pharmaceutical company.\n(NOTE: Want to know exactly how many unnecessary vaccines your dog gets?\u00c2\u00a0Click here to find out if your dog is over-vaccinated)\nVaccination Amnesty Campaign In The UK\nThe UK arm of veterinary pharmaceutical company (and vaccine manufacturer) Merck Animal Health is MSD Animal Health, and it operates under the name Intervet Ltd.\nIntervet is shameless about teaching veterinary clinics how to sell \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and make more money.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen one of their brochures promoting a clinic management system developed by veterinarian Dr Steven Garner, who has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most productive veterinary practice in the world [\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6] whilst each of his assistants is generating in excess of $1 million\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in yearly sales.\nThey claim the system results in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greater owner compliance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can grow your practice turnover [sales] by 40% and your practice profit by 52%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greater owner compliance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of course means they get you to bring your dog to the clinic more often \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and Intervet has dreamed up an especially sneaky way of persuading you to do that.\nIt starts with getting you to vaccinate your dog more often, and it also helps clinics sell you more veterinary services.\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called the Vaccination Amnesty program and for the last few years they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been campaigning hard to get UK veterinary clinics to participate.\nThe program targets clients whose pets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vaccines have lapsed \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lapsed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they mean that the last vaccination was given 18 months ago or more!\nSo it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hard to figure out that means the clinics are pushing annual vaccinations!\nIntervet provides veterinary clinics with an impressive array of promotional materials to market the amnesty program.\n\nOnce they join the program, clinics offer the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lapsed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pets a complete primary course of vaccinations for the price of a single booster.\nSo not only are they vaccinating animals who are almost certainly already protected (because we know they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been vaccinated before) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making them start from the beginning as if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never been vaccinated!\nAnd while your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the clinic, they do their best to find other ailments that need treating, as well as selling you things like dental procedures, worming and pest control medications.\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working quite well for them.\nTestimonials from clinics brag about how successful they were at selling additional services to people who brought their dogs in under the vaccine amnesty program.\nThe excerpt below from Intervet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s instructions to clinics suggests they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reimbursing participating clinics for the cost of these vaccinations (or perhaps offering other financial incentives):\n\nOnce again, this is a crafty way to make more money\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the expense of your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health.\nIn case I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear, over-vaccination exposes your dog to the potential for a lifetime of chronic disease.\nAnd if you think creative ways to sell more vaccines aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happening in the US as well, read on!\n(NOTE:\u00c2\u00a0Want to know exactly how many unnecessary vaccines your dog gets?\u00c2\u00a0Click here\u00c2\u00a0to find out if your dog is over-vaccinated)\nBanfield in the US\nYou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve almost certainly heard of Banfield Pet Hospital, a huge chain of more than 770 pet hospitals owned by the massive multinational conglomerate Mars \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and you may have even taken your dog there.\nThese clinics are all over the country and many are conveniently placed inside PetSmart stores \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so you can spend even more money when you take your dog to the vet!\nLike Greencross, Banfield wants you to bring your dog into the clinic twice a year so they can monitor your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dental care, behavior, parasite control, nutrition, and vaccinations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThey offer three levels of annual Optimal Wellness Plans\u00c2\u00ae that include a number of different services. They range in price from about $20 to $69 a month depending on where you live and which plan you choose.\nI want to go into a bit of detail on these Plans, because they include a very aggressive (and high risk) vaccination schedule.\nEvery plan includes a Comprehensive Physical Examination twice a year, plus other services ranging from vaccinations to deworming and blood, fecal and urine analysis. The higher level plans include services like annual dental cleaning, eye pressure tests, electrocardiograms and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153preventive X-rays.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nPreventive X-rays?\nThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153preventive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about exposing your dog to potentially cancer-causing radiation every year!\nAnd of course they encourage you to add \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extras\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like year-round parasite control.\nThe real problem, though, is Banfield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommended vaccination protocol as part of their annual wellness plans.\n\nLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s look at what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong with this vaccination schedule.\nFirst \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual!\nNote the \u00e2\u20ac\u01531x\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u01532x\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd alongside the vaccinations. Banfield wants to give all these vaccinations yearly, and twice yearly in the case of bordetella.\nWhile rabies is legally required all over the US and parts of Canada, giving it annually is not.\nAnd in fact the three-year rabies vaccine is the same as the one-year \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just labeled differently.\u00c2\u00a0 So make sure your vet uses a three-year rabies shot if you want to comply with rabies laws.\nDistemper and parvo are core vaccines but giving them annually is also unnecessary and risky. If your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already been vaccinated for these diseases, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to be protected from them for life.\nNext, the schedule includes the bacterial vaccines for leptospirosis, Lyme disease and bordetella.\nALL of these vaccines carry high risks of adverse effects.\nI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend giving them to your dog \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and neither does Dr Schultz.\nHe doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend giving lepto or Lyme vaccines (and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use these shots for his own dogs, even living in lepto and Lyme endemic areas), because of the high risk and low efficacy of these vaccines.\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever wondered why there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no Lyme vaccine for humans \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because it proved so dangerous in testing that it was withdrawn. And yet thousands of dogs are given the shot every year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for a disease that dogs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very likely to get.\nIn fact, 95% of dogs who test positive for Lyme are asymptomatic and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually have the disease.\nAs for leptospirosis, well \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 other than the high number of adverse reactions (including renal failure and mast cell tumors), there are over 230 serovars of lepto, but the vaccine contains only four.\nTalk about a shot in the dark!\nDr Schultz is also well known for saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kennel cough is not a vaccinatable disease.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is because there are at least 40 agents that can cause kennel cough, but the vaccine only addresses\u00c2\u00a0two of them.\nThese vaccines certainly should never be given routinely without consideration for the risks involved for your dog and whether he is even likely to be exposed to these diseases!\nFollow these links to more detailed information about Leptospirosis, Lyme Disease and Bordetella vaccinations to understand more about the risks and poor protection they offer.\nIf you do opt for one of Banfield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Optimal Wellness Programs, prepare yourself for a firm discussion with your vet about their vaccination schedule and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get pushed into annual shots for your dog.\nAs Dr Schultz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research shows, even every three years is too much \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so\u00c2\u00a0 get ready to say no!\nVaccination Is Big Business\nMy view is that the practice of annual vaccination is unethical \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 though not illegal, unfortunately.\nMost veterinarians in conventional practices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the corporate practices described above but also in most hometown practices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are charging you for something your dog doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need.\nIn the process they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually dys-regulating your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system, increasing the chance of adverse events and chronic disease.\nAnd you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying them to do this!\nPet vaccination is big business and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing. According to market research firm MarketsandMarkets, the global veterinary vaccines market could reach $7.2 billion by 2020, up from $5.5 billion in 2015.\nMy experience in veterinary clinics shows that about 15% of most clinics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 income is from vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and then another 65% is spent addressing the vaccine-induced diseases that result.\nWhen your dog develops chronic disease from vaccination, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lifetime of income for the clinic. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to see why they want you to vaccinate.\nSo remember this when you get that vaccination reminder in the mail \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nI see many vaccine-induced illnesses, especially in dogs around eight years old when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had years of unsafe and unnecessary vaccines.\nOver-vaccination can cause autoimmune diseases, cancer, cataracts, allergies, asthma, atopy, arthritis, anaphylaxis, diabetes, eczema and many lifelong, incurable conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as death.\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you get for your loyalty in responding to those little postcards!\n\u00c2\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n About the Author\t\t\tPatricia Jordan DVM \nPatricia  Jordan is a 1986 graduate of the North Carolina College of Veterinary Medicine.

It heated up in the 1800s, when parents in the UK became fed up with watching their healthy infants and children become ill or die shortly after the smallpox vaccinations or get sick from smallpox anyway.\u00c2\u00a0 Parents and doctors who refused smallpox vaccines,\u00c2\u00a0risked losing their homes, their furniture and their livelihoods if Judges found against them.\nThe smallpox vaccines were made from pus scraped off of diseased cows\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 belly sores, contaminated with disease matter from a variety of animals and in some cases, humans.\u00c2\u00a0 The smallpox vaccine history is probably not what you think it is.\nDoctors and those administering vaccines are supposed to obtain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153informed consent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before vaccinating.\u00c2\u00a0 Informed consent is not possible because parents are not given all the information they would require in order to understand the most important issues.\n I do not consider it my place to tell anyone whether to vaccinate or not. I never tell people to NOT vaccinate.\nIt is my place to understand as much as I can about vaccines and give people a more complete understanding from which to make their choices. This has not been the stance of the public health services. In fact there is ample documentation that the priority was quite the opposite, and actually to quell \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any possible doubts, whether well founded or not\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regarding vaccines.\n The following document is the American 1984 DHHS federal register, which listed final rules pertaining to the polio vaccination campaigns in USA after three decades of controversy.\nThat priority has placed many lives in jeopardy as major problems with vaccination were and are overlooked by vaccine policy makers.\nThere are many problems with the science that underpins vaccine information. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve yet to meet a pediatrician who understands both sides of the debate enough to give fully informed consent. Infant immunity has been misunderstood by immunologists, as the immunology literature admits to. Only recently have some important questions been answered about why infant immune systems don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t function like adult ones. There is good reason for the tolerance that an infant has, and the answer is not to interrupt the program with aluminum and vaccines to ramp it up. That is now known to have long term consequences.\nThere is a paucity of studies comparing never vaccinated children, with partially or fully vaccinated children.\u00c2\u00a0In terms of safety studies, a major issue is that most vaccine studies use another vaccine as the control placebo, or use the background substance of the vaccine.\u00c2\u00a0 There is only one recent study (Cowling 2012) where a true saline placebo was used, rather than another vaccine or the carrier fluid containing everything except the main antigen.That study showed no difference in influenza viral infection between groups but astonishingly it revealed a 5-6 times higher rate of non-influenza viral infections in the vaccinated. It is no small wonder more true placebos are not used in vaccine research.\nIn this\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0article, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Neonatal outcomes after influenza immunization during pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0 we see a clear example of how false placebos are regularly used. Needless to say, giving untested\u00c2\u00a0 vaccines which can often be unknowingly\u00c2\u00a0 contaminated, and with unproven-effectiveness vaccination is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153medical experiment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and in my opinion, violates the core principles of the Nuremberg Code (informed and unambiguous consent).\u00c2\u00a0 Most vaccines have never undergone carcinogenicity testing for example,\u00c2\u00a0and likewise are rarely studied in pregnant women, which results in\u00c2\u00a0people\u00c2\u00a0taking vaccines, either by a proclaimed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153emergency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153public health\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd order from the WHO; or by threat of loss of rights over one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s children or of imprisonment; or by threat of being abandoned by the medical professionals supposedly providing care.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Informed consent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is devoid of all meaning when people are tricked into taking vaccines by the use of\u00c2\u00a0misleading or frightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153information.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nParents must learn the ways to take care of their children when they get the common childhood illnesses, whether they vaccinate or not, since vaccinated children can still get the diseases they were vaccinated against.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0In the case of unvaccinated children, who experience childhood maladies, effective home-nursing most often\u00c2\u00a0allows children to recover naturally, and in most cases, the child will have long-term immunity.\nSome vaccine policies have robbed teenagers and adults of the opportunity to get re-exposed and continue with natural immunity.\u00c2\u00a0 For example, in mothers who were vaccinated against measles,\u00c2\u00a0placental transfer of antibodies is limited to a few months instead of over a year in most naturally immune mothers.\nThe above exemplifies but one of the many potential consequences we face as a result of vaccination for measles and the other childhood illnesses such as rubella.\nMedical schools do not educate about the contents, dangers, effectiveness or necessity of vaccines. Most medical doctors are fearful of the natural childhood illnesses because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any idea how to safely assist patients through them; and the limited mainstream treatment options I learned, often caused the diseases to be worse than they had to be.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet surprisingly, I discovered other methods which work extremely well, but were never presented as part of my medical education.\nIn a short article Tapping the immune system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secret the limitations of immunology are plainly spelled out.\u00c2\u00a0 The public is repeatedly misinformed, underinformed, or frightened in order to maintain participation in vaccination.\u00c2\u00a0 All sorts of tactics are used. One of the most popular, is to say that everyone should get vaccinated in order to protect the unvaccinated.\u00c2\u00a0 This is commonly known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0 HERE is an article I wrote on the subject.\nDoctors\u00c2\u00a0repeat the advice, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to vaccinate them while they are young so the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctake rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is high.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0 A case-in-point is an article for which I was interviewed where one of Maine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supposed top experts is giving misleading advice. In the article titled, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bangor Metro: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Shot to The Heart\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdhe says: :\nThis vaccine expert\u00c2\u00a0seems to lack understanding as to how an infant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system develops and why.\u00c2\u00a0 If he understood, he would pause for some time, before making such a dogmatic statement.\nA baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system produces only very small amounts of IL-1B and TNF-alpha.\u00c2\u00a0 There was a time when experts thought that this was simply a DEFECT in all newborn humans.\u00c2\u00a0 In 2004, a study by Chelvarajan suggested that if vaccine\u00c2\u00a0manufacturers added various immune system kickers into vaccines, this would solve the problem and fix these perfectly normal children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune systems, which are so often described in terms of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153defective\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inadequate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, when they are completely age appropriate, with characteristics shared by all land mammals.\nSubunit vaccines like HepB,\u00c2\u00a0 Strep Pneumo, Hib and Meningococcal\u00c2\u00a0 have potent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adjuvants\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0such as\u00c2\u00a0aluminum.\u00c2\u00a0 Without them, the baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system\u00c2\u00a0sits there and does nothing.\u00c2\u00a0 An adjuvant creates a red-alert situation forcing the infant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innate immune system to respond in the opposite manner to the way it should function in the first year of life.\u00c2\u00a0 Pro-vaccine immunologists see nothing wrong with this.\nHowever, by 2007, 2007, Chelvarajan was seeing things differently, and stated in the last paragraph, that whereas in the past, they had considered this a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153defect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, they now considered it:an important developmental program when he said:\nIn order to adjust to the world appropriately,\u00c2\u00a0an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-inflammatory phenotype\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is\u00c2\u00a0critical to an infant. Breast milk acts as a stand-in innate immune system, which protects the baby from toxin-mediated and other diseases, by supplying anti-inflammatory substances in the milk along with\u00c2\u00a0other immune particles which prevent bacteria and viruses from adhering, or kills them outright.\nThis protects the baby,\u00c2\u00a0acting as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in loco\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd defense, while\u00c2\u00a0the infant\u00c2\u00a0immune system is being programmed to know self from non-self.\u00c2\u00a0 This same pattern of development is seen in laboratories where they study non-human mammals, and is ubiquitous across mammals, showing that the anti-inflammatory phenotype is crucial to successful survival both short and long term.\nA more recent article by Elahi in 2013, showed that infant immune cells have full functional capacity, but are clamped down for a higher purpose while learning what is self, what is a healthy commensal micro-organism, and what should later be attacked.\nDuring this period of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclamping\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which is approximately 2 human years (extrapolated from animal studies), the infant is well compensated by the mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s human milk, which continues the educational process and kills unwanted organisms. What then, could be the effect of vaccines, which interfere with the quiescent state of the infant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system master plan, adding large amounts of aluminum\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddo?\nWith breastmilk support, an infant immune system develops appropriately and systematically\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c in its own due time, according to the genetic program placed in the baby from the day the child was conceived.\u00c2\u00a0 What is that master plan?\u00c2\u00a0To\u00c2\u00a0enable the infant to safely transition\u00c2\u00a0into immunological independence with the minimum level of inflammation possible.\u00c2\u00a0 Can that system be derailed?\u00c2\u00a0 Yes it can.\u00c2\u00a0 What can derail the neonatal immune system?\u00c2\u00a0 Anything which triggers an inflammatory response in the mother while she is pregnant and in the baby by the use of a vaccination.\nIronically the medical research is very clear about one thing.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153infection\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd per se that causes the problem.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the activation of the immune system.\u00c2\u00a0 How do they know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just the infection?\u00c2\u00a0 Because stress, toxins and other\u00c2\u00a0non-infectious antigens can trigger\u00c2\u00a0the immune system cascade, in very similar ways to infection.\nIf it is important for successful development of a baby to allow the RISK of infection by NOT allowing two key parts of the primary infection defense to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the OTHER risk you might take, if you force an immune system to do something it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not supposed to do?\u00c2\u00a0 A vaccine by definition, causes repeated, chronic inflammation at set time intervals.\u00c2\u00a0 Vaccines are designed to create peripheral inflammation, and vaccine adjuvants and antigens can cause brain inflammation, create allergies, and autoimmunity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c resulting in constant inflammation all around the body.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0For some children vaccines can also cause mitochondria to stop working properly.\nSo, you might now be thinking\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6if a baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s default position is to NOT respond to toxin-mediated bacterial diseases, what chance does a baby have to survive in this world? If you would like to learn more about neonatal immunity, read this 3 part blog series, and take note of the medical articles used:\n Infant immune system development. \nProvaccine doctors sometimes cite \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peer reviewed literature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to supposedly prove their point, yet a closer look at their own literature\u00c2\u00a0often proves otherwise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as does a closer look at the sick population of vaccinated children they look after.\nFurthermore a close look at medical text books down the decades reveals a very interesting trend.\u00c2\u00a0 In the 1920s and 30s, doctors were often quite relaxed over diseases which today are presented as more deadly than the plague.\u00c2\u00a0 Many grandparents today are completely bemused at the way the medical profession describes infections which were to most of\u00c2\u00a0them, straightforward holidays off school.\nThis is not stating that there were never serious consequences.\u00c2\u00a0 There sometimes were.\u00c2\u00a0 However, today, most parents erroneously believe that every child will die from diseases which most grandparents found were nuisance value only.\nThe medical system now considers measles more dangerous than the plague, and the most dangerous disease known to man.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet there is no need to be afraid of measles, because well-nourished children who get adequate vitamin A\u00c2\u00a0have an unremarkable course to recovery.\u00c2\u00a0 Boredom might be their biggest whine.\nI have discovered that whooping cough isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something to be scared of either.\u00c2\u00a0 In the days when my only tool was an antibiotic, whooping cough occasionally caused me considerable concern, but not today.\u00c2\u00a0 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve watched many parents all over the world\u00c2\u00a0treat whooping cough very simply by using high doses of vitamin C and occasionally homeopathy. They see rapid improvement and no serious complications.\u00c2\u00a0 But you will not read about these cases in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peer reviewed literature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and your doctor doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about them, because sick children are the only ones\u00c2\u00a0counted in the morbidity statistics.\u00c2\u00a0 Healthy children who uneventfully\u00c2\u00a0recover, are not seen by\u00c2\u00a0the medical system and therefore are not counted.\nThe\u00c2\u00a0serious consequences from most childhood diseases comes from just a few things; infant formula, cow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s milk, common medical drugs especially antibioitcs, malnutrition, and vaccines, as well and a lack of knowledge about simple methods of home nursing.\nAll of these barriers to recovery are completely avoidable in the USA and many other countries and that is WHY we see so many healthy children who were never vaccinated, when we take the time to\u00c2\u00a0look.\nSee how mortality for the common illnesses had declined significantly long before the vaccines were created.\nHere are a few common misconceptions about NOT vaccinating:\nYou are putting other people at risk by not vaccinating.\u00c2\u00a0 At risk for what?\u00c2\u00a0 Chicken pox? Ask your grandmother if she knew anyone who died from measles.\u00c2\u00a0 Different diseases have different degrees of severity in different age groups.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0The misconception that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate, you place others at risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is based on an assumption that vaccinated people do not get the disease they were vaccinated for.\u00c2\u00a0 Did you know that a\u00c2\u00a0controlled study published in BMJ in school age children showed that of all the whooping cough that was diagnosed, over 86% of the children were fully vaccinated and up to date for the whooping cough vaccine? There are similar studies showing that mumps and measles breakouts\u00c2\u00a0often affect the vaccinated. People who are vaccinated can\u00c2\u00a0have their immune systems altered in a manner that leads to susceptibility to other infectious diseases, and can also\u00c2\u00a0leave them vulnerable to the disease they were vaccinated for due to a phenomenon called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153original antigenic sin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\u00c2\u00a0 What\u00c2\u00a0is\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153original antigenic sin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd?\u00c2\u00a0 This is where an injected\u00c2\u00a0vaccine antigen\u00c2\u00a0programs the body to react in a manner that is incomplete, and different to the natural response to infection .\u00c2\u00a0 When the vaccinated contact that disease again, they are unable to mount an effective response to the pathogen because vital first steps are missing.\u00c2\u00a0 The whooping cough vaccine is an example of this.\nA very noteworthy\u00c2\u00a0study was published in 2013, looking at baboons, which are susceptible and manifest whooping cough like humans do. In the study by Warfel, baboons who were either vaccinated or not vaccinated were later exposed to pertussis bacteria, something that cannot be done experimentally in humans (due to ethical considerations), but which yields very important data. Expectedly, the baboons that had never been infected got the cough and remained colonized with bacteria for a maximum of 38 days. Baboons that were previously vaccinated and immune vaccine-style, became colonized upon later exposure for a longer time than the na\u00c3\u00afve baboons; 42 days. However unvaccinated baboons that recovered naturally and were later exposed to the bacteria did not become colonized at all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c zero days. \nSo, who is providing better herd immunity in the face of bacterial exposure? Vaccinated individuals who presume they are immune, yet remain asymptomatically colonized for 42 days spreading bacteria? Unvaccinated kids who get infected and remain colonized for 38 days? Or the naturally convalesced who are not able to be colonized and therefore do not spread bacteria at all upon re-exposure? Better still: natural convalescence makes for decades longer, solid immunity than vaccination.\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Live vaccines can spread disease.\nWe also know that in pertussis (whooping cough) those who are vaccinated are more likely, due to original antigenic sin, to be carriers of the bacteria longer than the non-vaccinated, even when asymptomatic.\u00c2\u00a0 In his article published in Clinical Infectious Disease in 2004 Full text article available here, Dr. James Cherry pointed out that adults, re-vaccinated against pertussis, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t develop any antibacterial activity whatsoever. He went on to explain why. The current vaccines contain a few antigens, which create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153original antigenic sin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, whereby the immune response to the vaccine is abnormal. That first-learned response then becomes the default position the immune system takes, on future booster shots. So in the case of the whooping cough vaccines there are key protein virulence factors which have not been included in the vaccines including ACT, TCF, TCT, as well as BrkA and DNT.\nBecause the first three are not included, the default immune response does not prevent colonization, and furthermore, Cherry stated that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153original antigenic sin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd results in the vaccinated being unable to clear the bacteria from their lungs. The non-vaccinated have immunity to all the front line virulence factors and very quickly clear the bacteria on re-exposure.\nMothers who have been vaccinated, may develop surrogate markers which can be measured in a laboratory, but these do not guarantee efficient immune responses after exposure to the natural disease, because their first \u00e2\u20ac\u0153learned response\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was incorrect. Furthermore, they are still not sure \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the surrogate marker actually is for pertussis.\nThere is similar information on measles, the other disease that has\u00c2\u00a0been portrayed by the media as a\u00c2\u00a0danger to the population due to non-vaccinated children.\u00c2\u00a0 But this information is not accurate, nor is measles a dangerous disease in people who have sufficient vitamin A.\u00c2\u00a0 Damien pointed out that the vaccinated are 5-8 times more susceptible to asymptomatic infection than the non-vaccinated.\u00c2\u00a0 How then, are the non-vaccinated solely responsible for the recent outbreaks in measles?\nMany vaccines are said to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attenuated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or modified-live and supposedly do not infect, but over the decades we have seen how those attenuated viruses mutate once they are in a human and can spread more virulent disease than what is being vaccinated for.\u00c2\u00a0 The oral polio vaccines in Nigeria today is a case in point.\u00c2\u00a0 But this can happen with any attenuated viral vaccine.\nThe original Salk polio vaccines were supposed to be killed vaccines and yet they infected thousands of people, the household contacts and the community, killing and paralyzing over 200 people. This figure is thought to be a gross underestimate of the damage done.\nIt is not uncommon to see a child recently vaccinated for chicken pox develop shingles or chicken pox.\u00c2\u00a0 We see this often enough.\u00c2\u00a0I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also\u00c2\u00a0seen shingles vaccine (which\u00c2\u00a0has 14 times the amount of virus as the chickenpox vaccine)\u00c2\u00a0provoke shingles in an elderly woman days after the vaccine was given. And strange enough, it sent all the doctors taking care of her reading to see if shingles vaccines can cause shingles, because doctors know almost nothing about vaccines.\nHere are things to consider when you hear of an outbreak of an infectious disease:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153How many of the affected were fully vaccinated and how many people died or were hospitalized? Were the cases verified with laboratory tests or are the reports based on community doctor reports?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAnother question to bear in mind is, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Were the people hospitalized because the disease was really serious, or because the family didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to deal with it, and responded to a medical profession hard-wired to believe everyone with that disease can die?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0 In other words, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Was the admission to hospital really necessary?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n What is the evidence for a causal link between hygiene and infections?\nHere is something else you may not have been informed of:\nAll the reduction even for TB in USA, was achieved BEFORE any vaccines of any sort were offered, and most of the reductions for all diseases, were achieved before antibiotics became commercially available in about 1950 as well. So what did that? It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccines.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet\u00c2\u00a0all the countries which used the BCG as front line \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protection\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, saw an identical decline to the one which we saw in USA using no TB vaccine.\nIf you compare graphs for death decline in diphtheria and scarlet fever, they are almost identical.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet there never was a widely used vaccine for scarlet fever. Scarlet fever and its resulting complication, rheumatic fever \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has clearly been shown in the medical literature, to be nutritionally driven.\u00c2\u00a0 This is why if you do find someone who says they had scarlet fever, it is primarily in more impoverished, war-torn,\u00c2\u00a0hungry and poverty stricken countries.\u00c2\u00a0 In\u00c2\u00a0developed countries where rheumatic fever is an issue, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primarily\u00c2\u00a0seen\u00c2\u00a0in the\u00c2\u00a0less educated groups, whose nutritional understanding is limited, or their access to good food is limited.\nYet under-educated people in stable social environments, without much money, who understand and follow effective nutritional pathways, will be on the scale of low susceptibility because it really is the nutrition and well being, that counts.\u00c2\u00a0 It just so happens that low education, homelessness and low money often co-exist.\nThe reason it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant problem in the less educated, less nourished groups where poverty is rampant, is because poor nutrition, which historically correlated with higher rheumatic fever.\u00c2\u00a0 All of us carry Strep A regularly, but the well-fed amongst us don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get scarlet fever, let alone its complication, rheumatic fever.\nThis point is well studied enough to lay aside any concern over whether or not correlation implies causation.\nHistorically, in the case of infectious diseases,\u00c2\u00a0good nutrition has been and still is, a major preventive factor, that has led to enormous declines of morbidity and mortality from most infectious diseases.\n","50":"Distributed via the CDC Health Alert Network\nJanuary 23, 2015, 14:00 ET (2:00 PM ET)\nCDCHAN-00376\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and State Health Departments are investigating a multi-state outbreak of measles associated with travel to Disneyland Resort Theme Parks (which includes Disneyland and Disney California Adventure). The purpose of this HAN Advisory is to notify public health departments and healthcare facilities about this measles outbreak and to provide guidance to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers should ensure that all of their patients are current on MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. They should consider measles in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever and rash and ask patients about recent international travel or travel to domestic venues frequented by international travelers. They should also ask patients about their history of measles exposures in their community. Please disseminate this information to healthcare providers in hospitals and emergency rooms, to primary care providers, and to microbiology laboratories.\nMeasles is a highly contagious, acute viral illness. It begins with a prodrome of fever, cough, coryza (runny nose), conjunctivitis (pink eye), lasting 2-4 days prior to rash onset. Measles can cause severe health complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Measles is transmitted by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing; infected people are contagious from 4 days before their rash starts through 4 days afterwards. After an infected person leaves a location, the virus remains viable for up to 2 hours on surfaces and in the air.\nThe United States is experiencing a large multi-state measles outbreak that started in California in December 2014 and has spread to six additional states and Mexico. The initial confirmed case-patients reported visiting Disneyland Resort Theme Parks in Orange County, CA, from December 17 through December 20, 2014. From December 28, 2014, through January 21, 2015, 51 confirmed cases of measles linked to this outbreak have been reported to CDC, 42 from California and 9 from six other states (3 in UT, 2 in WA, 1 in OR, 1 in CO, 1 in NE, and 1 in AZ). In addition to the U.S. cases, one case was reported from Mexico in an unvaccinated child who visited Disneyland Resort Theme Parks on December 17 and December 20, 2014. At this time, no source case for the outbreak has been identified, but it is likely that a traveler (or more than one traveler) who was infected with measles overseas visited one or both of the Disney parks in December during their infectious period.\nFor cases with age reported, the age of case-patients range from 10 months to 57 years (median = 16.5 years). To date, 8 (15%) case-patients were hospitalized. Of the 52 outbreak-associated cases, 28 (55%) were unvaccinated, 17 (31%) had unknown vaccination status, and 6 (12%) were vaccinated. Of the 6 cases vaccinated, 2 had received 1 dose and 4 had received 2 or more doses. Among the 28 unvaccinated cases, 5 were under age for vaccination. Measles genotype information was available from 9 measles cases; all were genotype B3 and all sequences linked to this outbreak are identical. The sequences are also identical to the genotype B3 virus that caused a large outbreak in the Philippines in 2014. During the last 6 months, identical genotype B3 viruses were also detected in at least 14 countries and at least 6 U.S. states, not including those linked to the current outbreak.\nMeasles was declared eliminated (i.e., interruption of year-round endemic transmission) in the United States in 2000, because of high population immunity achieved by high 2-dose measles vaccine coverage and a highly effective measles vaccine. However, measles is still endemic in many parts of the world, and outbreaks can occur in the U.S. when unvaccinated groups are exposed to imported measles virus. In 2014, nearly half of importations in the U.S. were linked to travel to the Philippines during the large measles outbreak in that country. Disney and other theme parks are international attractions, and visitors come from many parts of the world, including locations where measles is endemic. The current multi-state outbreak underscores the ongoing risk of importation of measles, the need for high measles vaccine coverage, and the importance of a prompt and appropriate public health response to measles cases and outbreaks.\nBecause of the success of the measles vaccine program, most young physicians have never seen a case of measles and may not take a detailed history of travel or potential exposure and initially may not consider the diagnosis in a clinically compatible case.\nEnsure all patients are up to date on MMR vaccine* and other vaccines.\nConsider measles as a diagnosis in anyone with a febrile rash illness and clinically compatible symptoms (cough, coryza, and\/or conjunctivitis) who has recently traveled abroad or who has had contact with someone with a febrile rash illness. Immunocompromised patients may not exhibit rash or may exhibit an atypical rash. The incubation period for measles from exposure to fever is usually about 10 days (range, 7 to 12 days) and from exposure to rash onset is usually 14 days (range, 7 to 21 days).\nIsolate suspect measles case-patients and immediately report cases to local health departments to ensure a prompt public health response.\nObtain specimens for testing, including viral specimens for confirmation and genotyping.\u00c2\u00a0 Contact the local health department for assistance with submitting specimens for testing.\n* Children 1 through 12 years of age may receive MMRV vaccine for protection against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a0 Infants who receive a dose of MMR vaccine before their first birthday should receive 2 more doses of MMR vaccine, the first of which should be administered when the child is 12 through 15 months of age and the second at least 28 days later.\n** One of the following is considered evidence of measles immunity for international travelers: 1) birth before 1957, 2) documented administration of 2 doses of live measles virus vaccine (MMR, MMRV, or measles vaccines), 3) laboratory (serologic) proof of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease.\nCDC.

For the communication and psychological theory, see Inoculation theory.\n\"Inoculator\" redirects here. For the pop punk EP, see Smoking Popes.\nThe terms inoculation, vaccination, immunization and injection are often used synonymously to refer to artificial induction of immunity against various infectious diseases. This is supported by some dictionaries.[1] [2] [3] However, there are some important historical and current differences. In English medicine inoculation referred only to the prevention of smallpox until the very early 1800s. When Edward Jenner introduced smallpox vaccine in 1798 this was initially called cowpox inoculation or vaccine inoculation. Soon, to avoid confusion, smallpox inoculation was referred to as variolation (from variola = smallpox) and cowpox inoculation was referred to as vaccination (from Jenner's use of variolae vaccinae = smallpox of the cow). Then, in 1891 Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms vaccine and vaccination should be extended to include the new protective procedures being developed. Immunization refers to the use of all vaccines but also extends to the use of antitoxin, which contains preformed antibody to e.g. diphtheria or tetanus exotoxins. Inoculation is now more or less synonymous in nontechnical usage with injection etc., and the question e.g. 'Have you had your flu injection\/vaccination\/inoculation\/immunization?' should not cause confusion. The focus is on what is being given and why, not the literal meaning of the technique used.\nInoculation also has a specific meaning for procedures done in vitro. These include the transfer of microorganisms into and from laboratory apparatus such as test tubes and petri dishes in research and diagnostic laboratories, and also in commercial applications such as brewing, baking, oenology (wine making) and the production of antibiotics.\nIn almost all cases the material inoculated is called the inoculum, or less commonly the inoculant, although the term culture is also used for work done in vitro.\nThe term inoculation entered medical English through horticultural usage meaning to graft a bud (or eye) from one plant into another. It is derived from the Latin in + oculus (eye).[1] Though innoculation\/innoculate is sometimes seen, this is incorrect, possibly erroneously thought to be related to innocuous, which is derived from the Latin in + nocuus (not harmful).\nInoculation originated as a method for the prevention of smallpox by deliberate introduction of material from smallpox pustules into the skin. This generally produced a less severe infection than naturally-acquired smallpox, but still induced immunity to it. This first method for smallpox prevention, smallpox inoculation, is now also known as variolation.\nThe earliest hints of the practice of inoculation for smallpox in China come during the 10th century.[4] A Song dynasty (960\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1279) chancellor of China, Wang Dan (957\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1017), lost his eldest son to smallpox and sought a means to spare the rest of his family from the disease, so he summoned physicians, wise men, and magicians from all across the empire to convene at the capital in Kaifeng and share ideas on how to cure patients of it until the gods sent a divine man from Mt. O-mei who carried out inoculation. However, the sinologist Joseph Needham states that this information comes from the Zhongdou xinfa (\u00e7\u00a8\u00ae\u00e7\u2014\u02dc\u00e5\u00bf\u0192\u00e6\u00b3\u2022) written in 1808 by Zhu Yiliang, centuries after the alleged events.[4]\nThe first clear and credible reference to smallpox inoculation in China comes from Wan Quan's (1499\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1582) Douzhen xinfa (\u00e7\u2014\u02dc\u00e7\u2013\u00b9\u00e5\u00bf\u0192\u00e6\u00b3\u2022) of 1549, which states that some women unexpectedly menstruate during the procedure, yet his text did not give details on techniques of inoculation.[5] Inoculation was first vividly described by Yu Chang in his book Yuyi cao (\u00e5\u00af\u201c\u00e6\u201e\ufffd\u00e8\ufffd\u2030), or Notes on My Judgment, published in 1643. Inoculation was reportedly not widely practised in China until the reign of the Longqing Emperor (r. 1567\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1572) during the Ming dynasty (1368\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1644), as written by Yu Tianchi in his Shadou jijie (\u00e7\u2014\u00a7\u00e7\u2014\u02dc\u00e9\u203a\u2020\u00e8\u00a7\u00a3) of 1727, which he alleges was based on Wang Zhangren's Douzhen jinjing lu (\u00e7\u2014\u02dc\u00e7\u2013\u00b9\u00e9\u2021\u2018\u00e9\ufffd\u00a1\u00e9\u0152\u201e) of 1579.[5] From these accounts, it is known that the Chinese banned the practice of using smallpox material from patients who actually had the full-blown disease of Variola major (considered too dangerous); instead they used proxy material of a cotton plug inserted into the nose of a person who had already been inoculated and had only a few scabs, i.e. Variola minor. This was called \"to implant the sprouts\", an idea of transplanting the disease which fit their conception of beansprouts in germination. Needham quotes an account from Zhang Yan's Zhongdou xinshu (\u00e7\u00a8\u00ae\u00e7\u2014\u02dc\u00e6\u2013\u00b0\u00e6\u203a\u00b8), or New book on smallpox inoculation, written in 1741 during the Qing dynasty (1644\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1912), which shows how the Chinese process had become refined up until that point:\nTwo reports on the Chinese practice were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers. But no action was taken.[6]\nAccording to Voltaire (1742), the Turks derived their use of inoculation to neighbouring Circassia.\nThe Circassian women have, from time immemorial, communicated the small-pox to their children when not above six months old by making an incision in the arm, and by putting into this incision a pustule, taken carefully from the body of another child. This pustule produces the same effect in the arm it is laid in as yeast in a piece of dough; it ferments, and diffuses through the whole mass of blood the qualities with which it is impregnated. The pustules of the child in whom the artificial small-pox has been thus inoculated are employed to communicate the same distemper to others. There is an almost perpetual circulation of it in Circassia; and when unhappily the small-pox has quite left the country, the inhabitants of it are in as great trouble and perplexity as other nations when their harvest has fallen short...The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed, it is in them they chiefly trade. They furnish with beauties the seraglios of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian Sophy, and of all those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious merchandise.[7]\nVoltaire does not speculate on where the Circassians derived their technique from, though he reports that the Chinese have practiced it \"these hundred years\". The Turkish practice was presented to the Royal Society in 1714 and 1716, when the physicians Emanuel Timoni [8] and Giacomo Pylarini independently sent letters from Constantinople.[9]\nVariolation is documented in India from the eighteenth century, thanks to the 1767 account by J. Z. Holwell.[10] Holwell's extensive 1767 description included the following statement, on p.25, that points to the connection between disease and \"multitudes of imperceptible animalculae floating in the atmosphere\":\nHolwell ascribes this account to his Brahman informants. However, such a theory has not yet been discovered in any Sanskrit or vernacular treatise.[11] Holwell's use of the word \"animalculae\" suggests that he may have been aware of the observations of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek made in about 1683. Other parts of Holwell's account, especially his use of the idea of \"immediate\" and \"mediate\" causation, and the concept of \"fermentation,\" suggest that these notions may not necessarily be entirely of Indian origin but may also be influenced by contemporary developments in microbiology.\nSeveral historians have suggested that variolation may be older than the eighteenth century in India,[12] but historical evidence for this assertion is lacking. The widespread rumour since the nineteenth century that vaccination was documented in India before the discoveries of Edward Jenner can all be traced to propaganda tracts written in Sanskrit and the Indian vernaculars by colonial officers, in the pious hope of convincing Indians to accept the newly discovered Jennerian procedure.[13] [14] A landmark anthropological study by Ralph Nicholas described the mid-twentieth century rituals of appeasement to \u00c5\u0161\u00c4\u00abtal\u00c4\ufffd, the Indian goddess of smallpox, in Bengal.[15]\nHolwell's account proves beyond doubt that smallpox inoculation was practised in India in the eighteenth century. Yet no Sanskrit or vernacular Indian sources yet discovered mention the practice. Some details of the practice described by Holwell such as sniffing suggest Chinese practice.[citation needed]\nEarly travellers to Ethiopia report that variolation was practiced by the Amhara and Tigray peoples. The first European to report this was Nathaniel Pearce, who noted in 1831, that it was performed by a debtera who would collect \"a quantity of matter\" from a person with the most sores from smallpox, then he \"cuts a small cross with a razor in the arm\" of his subject and put \"a little of the matter\" into the cut which was afterwards bound up with a bandage. Subsequent visitors who described this practice included W. C. Harris and Dr. Petit of the French scientific mission of 1839-1841.[16]\nThe knowledge of inoculating oneself against smallpox seems to have been known to West Africans, more specifically the Akan. A slave named Onesimus explained the inoculation procedure to Cotton Mather during the 18th century, he reported to have gotten the knowledge from Africa.[17]\nIn January 1714 Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society published an account of a letter John Woodward had received from Emmanuel Timonius in Constantinople.[18] Smallpox inoculation was advocated as a proven method of curbing the severity of the disease.\nThe practice was introduced to England by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Lady Montagu's husband, Edward Wortley Montagu, served as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1716 to 1718. She witnessed firsthand the Turkish use of inoculation in Istanbul,[19] and was greatly impressed:[20] she had lost a brother to smallpox and bore facial scars from the disease herself. When a smallpox epidemic threatened England in 1721, she called on her physician to inoculate her daughter. She invited friends to see her daughter, including Sir Hans Sloane, the King's physician. Sufficient interest arose that Maitland gained permission to test inoculation at Newgate Prison in exchange for their freedom on six prisoners due to be hanged, an experiment which was witnessed by a number of notable doctors.[21] All survived, and in 1722 the Prince of Wales' daughters received inoculations.[22]\nThe practice of inoculation slowly spread amongst the royal families of Europe, usually followed by more general adoption amongst the people.\nThe practice is documented in America as early as 1721, when Zabdiel Boylston, at the urging of Cotton Mather, successfully inoculated two slaves and his own son. Mather, a prominent Boston minister, had heard a description of the African practice of inoculation from his Sudanese slave, Onesimus, in 1706, and later from Timoni's report to the Royal Society,[23] but had been previously unable to convince local physicians to attempt the procedure.[24] Following this initial success, Boylston began performing inoculations throughout Boston, despite much controversy and at least one attempt upon his life. The effectiveness of the procedure was proven when, of the nearly three hundred people Boylston inoculated during the outbreak, only six died, whereas the mortality rate among those who contracted the disease naturally was one in six.[25] Boylston traveled to London in 1724. There he published his results and was elected to the Royal Society in 1726.\nIn France, considerable opposition arose to the introduction of inoculation, and it was banned by the Parlement. Voltaire, in his Lettres Philosophiques, wrote a criticism of his countrymen for being opposed to inoculation and having so little regard for the welfare of their children, concluding that \"had inoculation been practised in France it would have saved the lives of thousands.\".[27]\nInoculation grew in popularity in Europe through the 18th century. Given the high prevalence and often severe consequences of smallpox in Europe in the 18th century (according to Voltaire, there was a 60% incidence of first infection, a 20% mortality rate, and a 20% incidence of severe scarring),[28] many parents felt that the benefits of inoculation outweighed the risks and so inoculated their children.[29]\nTwo forms of the disease of smallpox were recognised, now known to be due to two strains of the Variola virus. Those contracting Variola minor had a greatly reduced risk of death \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c compared to those contracting Variola major with 30% mortality. Infection via inhaled viral particles in droplets spread the infection more widely than the deliberate infection through a small skin wound. The smaller, localised infection is adequate to stimulate the immune system to produce specific immunity to the virus, while requiring more generations of the virus to reach levels of infection likely to kill the patient. The rising immunity terminates the infection. So the twofold effect is to ensure the less fatal form of the disease is the one caught, and to give the immune system the best start possible in combating it.\nInoculation in the East was historically performed by blowing smallpox crusts into the nostril. In Britain, Europe and the American Colonies the preferred method was rubbing material from a smallpox pustule from a selected mild case (Variola minor) into a scratch between the thumb and forefinger.[30] This would generally be performed when an individual was in normal good health, and thus at peak resistance. The recipient would develop smallpox; however, due to being introduced through the skin rather than the lungs, and possibly because of the inoculated individual's preexisting state of good health, the small inoculum, and the single point of initial infection, the resulting case of smallpox was generally milder than the naturally occurring form, produced far less facial scarring, and had a far lower mortality rate. As with survivors of the natural disease, the inoculated individual was subsequently immune to re-infection.\nIn 1798, the English surgeon\/scientist Edward Jenner published the results of his experiments and thus introduced the far superior and safer method of inoculation with cowpox virus, a mild infection that also induced immunity to smallpox. Jenner was not the first person to inoculate with cowpox nor the first to realize that infection with cowpox gave immunity to smallpox. However, he was the first to publish evidence that it was effective and to provide advice on its production. His efforts led to smallpox inoculation falling into disuse and eventually being banned in England in 1840.[31]\n\u00d9\ufffd\u00d8\u00a7\u00d8\u00b1\u00d8\u00b3\u00db\u0152 \nNorsk bokm\u00c3\u00a5l \n\u00d0\u00a1\u00d1\u20ac\u00d0\u00bf\u00d1\ufffd\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8 \/ srpski \n","52":"Hepatitis B vaccine is a vaccine that prevents hepatitis B.[1] The first dose is recommended within 24 hours of birth with either two or three more doses given after that. This includes those with poor immune function such as from HIV\/AIDS and those born premature. In healthy people routine immunization results in more than 95% of people being protected.[1]\nBlood testing to verify that the vaccine has worked is recommended in those at high risk. Additional doses may be needed in people with poor immune function but are not necessary for most people. In those who have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus but not immunized, hepatitis B immune globulin should be given in addition to the vaccine. The vaccine is given by injection into a muscle.[1]\nSerious side effects from the hepatitis B vaccine are very uncommon. Pain may occur at the site of injection. It is safe for use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. It has not been linked to Guillain\u00e2\u20ac\u201cBarr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome. The current vaccines are produced with recombinant DNA techniques. They are available both by themselves and in combination with other vaccines.[1]\nThe first hepatitis B vaccine was approved in the United States in 1981.[2] A safer version came to market in 1986.[1] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[3] As of 2014, the wholesale cost in the developing world is US$0.58\u00e2\u20ac\u201c13.20 per dose.[4] In the United States it costs US$50\u00e2\u20ac\u201c100.[5]\nBabies born to mothers infected with HBV are vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine and injected with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG).[6]\nMany countries now routinely vaccinate infants against hepatitis B. In countries with high rates of hepatitis B infection, vaccination of newborns has not only reduced the risk of infection, but has also led to marked reduction in liver cancer. This was reported in Taiwan where the implementation of a nationwide hepatitis B vaccination program in 1984 was associated with a decline in the incidence of childhood hepatocellular carcinoma.[7]\nIn the UK, the vaccine is offered to MSM, usually as part of a sexual health check-up. A similar situation is in operation in Ireland.[8]\nIn many areas, vaccination against hepatitis B is also required for all health-care and laboratory staff.[9]\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued recommendations for vaccination against hepatitis B among patients with diabetes mellitus.[10]\nFollowing the primary course of 3 vaccinations, a blood test may be taken after an interval of 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 months to establish if there has been an adequate response, which is defined as an anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-Hbs) antibody level above 100 mIU\/ml. Such a full response occurs in about 85\u00e2\u20ac\u201c90% of individuals.[11]\nAn antibody level between 10 and 100 mIU\/ml is considered a poor response, and these people should receive a single booster vaccination at this time, but do not need further retesting.[11]\nPeople who fail to respond (anti-Hbs antibody level below 10 mIU\/ml) should be tested to exclude current or past Hepatitis B infection, and given a repeat course of 3 vaccinations, followed by further retesting 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 months after the second course. Those who still do not respond to a second course of vaccination may respond to intradermal administration[12] or to a high dose vaccine[13] or to a double dose of a combined hepatitis A and B vaccine.[14] Those who still fail to respond will require hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) if later exposed to the hepatitis B virus.[11]\nPoor responses are mostly associated with being over the age of 40 years, obesity and smoking,[15] and also in alcoholics, especially if with advanced liver disease.[16] Patients who are immunosuppressed or on renal dialysis may respond less well and require larger or more frequent doses of vaccine.[11] At least one study suggests that hepatitis B vaccination is less effective in patients with HIV.[17]\nIt is now believed that the hepatitis B vaccine provides indefinite protection. However, it was previously believed and suggested that the vaccination would only provide effective cover of between five and seven years,[18] [19] but subsequently it has been appreciated that long-term immunity derives from immunological memory which outlasts the loss of antibody levels and hence subsequent testing and administration of booster doses is not required in successfully vaccinated immunocompetent individuals.[20] [21] Hence with the passage of time and longer experience, protection has been shown for at least 25 years in those who showed an adequate initial response to the primary course of vaccinations,[22] and UK guidelines now suggest that for initial responders who require ongoing protection, such as for healthcare workers, only a single booster is advocated at 5 years.[11]\nSeveral studies looked for a significant association between recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) and multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults. Most published scientific studies do not support a causal relationship between hepatitis B vaccination and demyelinating diseases such as MS.[23] A 2004 study[24] reported a significant increase in risk within 3 years of vaccination. Some of these studies were criticized for methodological problems. This controversy created public misgivings about HB vaccination, and hepatitis B vaccination in children remained low in several countries. A 2006 study concluded that evidence did not support an association between HB vaccination and sudden infant death syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, or multiple sclerosis.[25] A 2007 study found that the vaccination does not seem to increase the risk of a first episode of MS in childhood.[26]\nA 2009 study of the hepatitis B vaccine and associated risk of CNS inflammatory demyelination was conducted. The hepatitis B vaccine was found to be generally safe, however the Engerix B vaccine appeared to triple the risk of CNS inflammatory demyelination in infant boys.[27] The study was criticized for methodological errors.[28]\nThe World Health Organization recommends a pentavalent vaccine, combining vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type B with the vaccine against hepatitis B. There is not yet sufficient evidence on how effective this pentavalent vaccine is in relation to the individual vaccines.[29]\nThe following is a list of countries by the percentage of infants receiving three doses of hepatitis B vaccine as published by the World Health Organization in 2014.[30]\nThe road to the hepatitis B vaccine began in 1963 when American physician\/geneticist Baruch Blumberg discovered what he called the \"Australia Antigen\" (now called HBsAg) in the serum of an Australian Aboriginal person.[31] In 1968, this protein was found to be part of the virus that causes \"serum hepatitis\" (hepatitis B) by virologist Alfred Prince.[32] The American microbiologist\/vaccinologist Maurice Hilleman at Merck used three treatments (pepsin, urea and formaldehyde) of blood serum together with rigorous filtration to yield a product that could be used as a safe vaccine. Hilleman hypothesized that he could make an HBV vaccine by injecting patients with hepatitis B surface protein. In theory, this would be very safe, as these excess surface proteins lacked infectious viral DNA. The immune system, recognizing the surface proteins as foreign, would manufacture specially shaped antibodies, custom-made to bind to, and destroy, these proteins. Then, in the future, if the patient were infected with HBV, the immune system could promptly deploy protective antibodies, destroying the viruses before they could do any harm.[33]\nHilleman collected blood from gay men and intravenous drug users\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgroups known to be at risk for viral hepatitis. This was in the late 1970s, when HIV was yet unknown to medicine. In addition to the sought-after hepatitis B surface proteins, the blood samples likely contained HIV. Hilleman devised a multistep process to purify this blood so that only the hepatitis B surface proteins remained. Every known virus was killed by this process, and Hilleman was confident that the vaccine was safe.[33]\nThe first large-scale trials for the blood-derived vaccine were performed on gay men, in accordance with their high-risk status. Later, Hilleman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccine was falsely blamed for igniting the AIDS epidemic. (See Wolf Szmuness) But, although the purified blood vaccine seemed questionable, it was determined to have indeed been free of HIV. The purification process had destroyed all viruses\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding HIV.[33] The vaccine was approved in 1981.\nThe blood-derived hepatitis B vaccine was withdrawn from the marketplace in 1986 when Pablo DT Valenzuela, Research Director of Chiron Corporation, succeeded in making the antigen in yeast and invented the world's first recombinant vaccine.[34] The recombinant vaccine was developed by inserting the HBV gene that codes for the surface protein into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This allows the yeast to produce only the noninfectious surface protein, without any danger of introducing actual viral DNA into the final product.[33] This is the vaccine still in use today.\nIn 1976, Blumberg had won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on hepatitis B (sharing it with Daniel Carleton Gajdusek for his work on kuru). In 2002, Blumberg published a book, Hepatitis B: The Hunt for a Killer Virus.[35] In the book, according to Paul A. Offit\u00e2\u20ac\u201dHilleman's biographer and an accomplished vaccinologist himself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dBlumberg...\nThe vaccine contains one of the viral envelope proteins, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It now produced by yeast cells, into which the genetic code for HBsAg has been inserted.[37] Afterward an immune system antibody to HBsAg is established in the bloodstream. The antibody is known as anti-HBs. This antibody and immune system memory then provide immunity to HBV infection.[38]\nThe common brands available are Recombivax HB (Merck), Engerix-B (GSK), Elovac B (Human Biologicals Institute, a division of Indian Immunologicals Limited), Genevac B (Serum Institute), Shanvac B, etc. These vaccines are given by the intramuscular route.\nTwinrix is a vaccine against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.\nInjectable Hepatitis B vaccines require expensive production processes and refrigeration, which can make them difficult to access in developing countries. As a result, researchers have been working to engineer plants capable of producing the ingredients necessary to make vaccines so that people can eat these plants to receive the vaccine. Potatoes, bananas, lettuce, carrots, tobacco are some of the plants being genetically engineered to produce the Hepatitis B vaccine ingredients.\nThe process of genetically engineering plants to produce the vaccine includes extracting the gene that codes for Hepatitis B surface antigens from the Hepatitis B genome, and placing it in a bacterial plasmid. The bacteria then infect a plant, which will produce the surface antigens. When a human eats the plant, their body is stimulated to produce an antibody response to the surface antigens. Although concerns remain in improving the efficacy of edible vaccines, controlling the dosage of vaccine in each plant, and managing land allocation for this process, scientists consider this a promising avenue for vaccinating underprivileged areas of the world.\n^ a b c d e \"Hepatitis B vaccines WHO position paper\" (PDF).

It is a mixture of live attenuated viruses of the three diseases, administered via injection. It was first developed by Maurice Hilleman while at Merck.[1]\nA licensed vaccine to prevent measles first became available in 1963, and an improved one in 1968. Vaccines for mumps and rubella became available in 1967 and 1969, respectively. The three vaccines (for mumps, measles, and rubella) were combined in 1971 to become the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.[2]\nThe MMR vaccine is generally administered to children around the age of one year, with a second dose before starting school (i.e. age 4\/5). The second dose is a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5%) who fail to develop measles immunity after the first dose.[3] In the United States, the vaccine was licensed in 1971 and the second dose was introduced in 1989.[4] It is widely used around the world; since introduction of its earliest versions in the 1970s, over 500 million doses have been used in over 60 countries. The vaccine is sold by Merck as M-M-R II, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals as Priorix, Serum Institute of India as Tresivac, and Sanofi Pasteur as Trimovax.\nIt is usually considered a childhood vaccination. However, it is also recommended for use in some cases of adults with HIV.[5] [6]\nBefore the widespread use of a vaccine against measles, its incidence was so high that infection with measles was felt to be \"as inevitable as death and taxes.\"[7] Reported cases of measles in the United States fell from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands per year following introduction of the vaccine in 1963. Increasing uptake of the vaccine following outbreaks in 1971 and 1977 brought this down to thousands of cases per year in the 1980s. An outbreak of almost 30,000 cases in 1990 led to a renewed push for vaccination and the addition of a second vaccine to the recommended schedule. Fewer than 200 cases have been reported each year between 1997 and 2013, and the disease is no longer considered endemic.[8] [9] [10]\nThe benefit of measles vaccination in preventing illness, disability, and death has been well documented. The first 20 years of licensed measles vaccination in the U.S. prevented an estimated 52 million cases of the disease, 17,400 cases of intellectual disability, and 5,200 deaths.[11] During 1999\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2004, a strategy led by the World Health Organization and UNICEF led to improvements in measles vaccination coverage that averted an estimated 1.4 million measles deaths worldwide.[12] Between 2000 and 2013, measles vaccination resulted in a 75% decrease in deaths from the disease.[13]\nMeasles is endemic worldwide. Although it was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, high rates of vaccination and good communication with persons who refuse vaccination are needed to prevent outbreaks and sustain the elimination of measles in the U.S.[14] Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated individual who acquired measles during a visit to Romania.[15] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; 9% were hospitalized, and the cost of containing the outbreak was estimated at $167,685. A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities.[14]\nMumps is another viral disease of childhood that was once very common. If mumps is acquired by a male who is past puberty, a possible complication is bilateral orchitis which can in some cases lead to sterility.[16]\nRubella, otherwise known as German measles, was also very common before the advent of widespread vaccination. The major risk of rubella is in pregnancy. If a pregnant woman is infected, her baby may contract congenital rubella from her, which can cause significant congenital defects.[17]\nThe combined MMR vaccine was introduced to induce immunity less painfully than three separate injections at the same time, and sooner and more efficiently than three injections given on different dates.\nIn 2012, the Cochrane Library published a systematic review of scientific studies. Its authors concluded, \"Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR vaccine supports current policies of mass immunisation aimed at global measles eradication and in order to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with mumps and rubella.\"[18]\nAs measles and rubella cause upper respiratory disease that leads to complications of pneumonia and bronchitis which are also caused by varicella, MMR vaccine is beneficial to control exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.\nThe component viral strains of MMR vaccine were developed by propagation in animal and human cells. The live viruses require animal or human cells as a host for production of more virus.\nFor example, in the case of mumps and measles viruses, the virus strains were grown in embryonated hens' eggs and chick embryo cell cultures. This produced strains of virus which were adapted for the hens egg and less well-suited for human cells. These strains are therefore called attenuated strains. They are sometimes referred to as neuroattenuated because these strains are less virulent to human neurons than the wild strains.\nThe Rubella component, Meruvax, was developed in 1967 through propagation using the human embryonic lung cell line WI-38 (named for the Wistar Institute) that was derived 6 years earlier in 1961.[19] [20]\nMMR II is supplied freeze-dried (lyophilized) and contains live viruses. Before injection it is reconstituted with the solvent provided.\nThe MMR vaccine is administered by a subcutaneous injection.The second dose may be given as early as one month after the first dose.[24] The second dose is a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5%) who fail to develop measles immunity after the first dose. In the U.S. it is done before entry to kindergarten because that is a convenient time.[3]\nAdverse reactions, rarely serious, may occur from each component of the MMR vaccine. Ten percent of children develop fever, malaise, and a rash 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 days after the first vaccination;[25] and 3% develop joint pain lasting 18 days on average.[26] Older women appear to be more at risk of joint pain, acute arthritis, and even (rarely) chronic arthritis.[27] Anaphylaxis is an extremely rare but serious allergic reaction to the vaccine.[28] One cause can be egg allergy.[29] In 2014, the FDA approved two additional possible adverse events on the vaccination label for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and transverse myelitis, with permission to also add \"difficulty walking\" to the package inserts.[30]\nThe number of reports on neurological disorders is very small, other than evidence for an association between a form of the MMR vaccine containing the Urabe mumps strain and rare adverse events of aseptic meningitis, a transient mild form of viral meningitis.[27] [31] The UK National Health Service stopped using the Urabe mumps strain in the early 1990s due to cases of transient mild viral meningitis, and switched to a form using the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain instead.[32] The Urabe strain remains in use in a number of countries; MMR with the Urabe strain is much cheaper to manufacture than with the Jeryl Lynn strain,[33] and a strain with higher efficacy along with a somewhat higher rate of mild side effects may still have the advantage of reduced incidence of overall adverse events.[32]\nThe Cochrane Library review found that, compared with placebo, MMR vaccine was associated with fewer upper respiratory tract infections, more irritability, and a similar number of other adverse effects.[18]\nNaturally acquired measles often occurs with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP, a purpuric rash and an increased tendency to bleed that resolves within two months in children). Between 1 in 25,000 and 1 in 40,000 children are thought to acquire ITP in the six weeks following an MMR vaccination, which is a higher rate than found in unvaccinated populations. ITP below the age of 6 years is generally a mild disease, rarely having long-term consequences.[34] [35]\nMain article: MMR vaccine controversy\nIn 1998 Andrew Wakefield et al. published a fraudulent paper about twelve children, reportedly with bowel symptoms and autism, or other disorders soon after administration of MMR vaccine,[36] whilst supporting a competing vaccine. In 2010, Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been \"dishonest\",[37] and The Lancet fully retracted the paper.[38] Three months following The Lancet's retraction, Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register, with a statement identifying deliberate falsification in the research published in The Lancet,[39] and was barred from practising medicine in the UK.[40] The research was declared fraudulent in 2011 by the British Medical Journal.[41]\nMany peer-reviewed studies have failed to show any association between the vaccine and autism.[42] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,[43] the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences,[44] the UK National Health Service [45] and the Cochrane Library review[18] have all concluded that there is no evidence of a link.\nAdministering the vaccines in three separate doses does not reduce the chance of adverse effects, and it increases the opportunity for infection by the two diseases not immunized against first.[42] [46] Health experts have criticized media reporting of the MMR-autism controversy for triggering a decline in vaccination rates.[47] Before publication of Wakefield's findings, the inoculation rate for MMR in the UK was 92%; after publication, the rate dropped to below 80%. In 1998, there were 56 measles cases in the UK; by 2008, there were 1348 cases, with two confirmed deaths.[48]\nIn Japan, the MMR vaccination has been discontinued, the vaccines are given as two doses. One a combination vaccine for Measles and Rubella MR and the other Mumps vaccine being given as a single dose. Rates of autism diagnosis have continued to increase, showing no correlation with the change.[49]\nIn the United States, a few celebrities have become anti-vaccination spokespeople. These include actors Jenny McCarthy,[50] and Jim Carrey.[51]\nMain article: MMRV vaccine\nThe MMRV vaccine, a combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine, has been proposed as a replacement for the MMR vaccine to simplify administration of the vaccines.[24] Preliminary data indicate a rate of fever fits of 9 per 10,000 vaccinations with MMRV, as opposed to 4 per 10,000 for separate MMR and varicella shots; U.S. health officials therefore do not express a preference for use of MMRV vaccine over separate injections.[52]\nIn a 2012 study[53] pediatricians and family doctors were sent a survey to gauge their awareness of the increased risk of febrile seizures (fever fits) in the MMRV. 74% of family doctors and 29% of pediatricians were unaware of the increased risk of febrile seizures. After reading an informational statement only 7% of family doctors and 20% of pediatricians would recommend the MMRV for a healthy 12- to 15-month-old child. The factor that was reported as the \"most important\" deciding factor in recommending the MMRV over the MMR+V was ACIP\/AAFP\/AAP recommendations (pediatricians, 77%; family physicians, 73%).\n^ \"Approval for label change\".\n","54":"Vaccination is the administration of antigenic material (a vaccine) to stimulate an individual's immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen. Vaccines can prevent or ameliorate morbidity from infection. When a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated, this results in herd immunity. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example, the influenza vaccine,[1] the HPV vaccine,[2] and the chicken pox vaccine.[3] Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases;[4] widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available to prevent or contribute to the prevention and control of twenty-five preventable infections.[5]\nThe active agent of a vaccine may be intact but inactivated (non-infective) or attenuated (with reduced infectivity) forms of the causative pathogens, or purified components of the pathogen that have been found to be highly immunogenic (e.g., outer coat proteins of a virus). Toxoids are produced for immunization against toxin-based diseases, such as the modification of tetanospasmin toxin of tetanus to remove its toxic effect but retain its immunogenic effect.[6]\nSmallpox was most likely the first disease people tried to prevent by inoculating themselves[7] [8] and was the first disease for which a vaccine was produced. The smallpox vaccine was invented in 1796 by the British physician Edward Jenner and although at least six people had used the same principles years earlier he was the first to publish evidence that it was effective and to provide advice on its production.[9] Louis Pasteur furthered the concept through his work in microbiology. The immunization was called vaccination because it was derived from a virus affecting cows (Latin: vacca 'cow').[7] [9] Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[10] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300\u00e2\u20ac\u201c500 million people[11] [12] [13] in the 20th century.\nIn common speech, vaccination and immunization have a similar meaning. This distinguishes it from inoculation, which uses unweakened live pathogens, although in common usage either can refer to an immunization. Vaccination efforts have been met with some controversy on scientific, ethical, political, medical safety, and religious grounds. In rare cases, vaccinations can injure people[14] and, in the United States, they may receive compensation for those injuries under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Early success and compulsion brought widespread acceptance, and mass vaccination campaigns have greatly reduced the incidence of many diseases in numerous geographic regions.\nGenerically, the process of artificial induction of immunity, in an effort to protect against infectious disease, works by 'priming' the immune system with an 'immunogen'. Stimulating immune responses with an infectious agent is known as immunization. Vaccination includes various ways of administering immunogens.[15]\nSome vaccines are administered after the patient already has contracted a disease. Vaccines given after exposure to smallpox, within the first three days, are reported to attenuate the disease considerably, and vaccination up to a week after exposure probably offers some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease.[16] The first rabies immunization was given by Louis Pasteur to a child after he was bitten by a rabid dog. Subsequent to this, it has been found that, in people with uncompromised immune systems, four doses of rabies vaccine over 14 days, wound care, and treatment of the bite with rabies immune globulin, commenced as soon as possible after exposure, is effective in preventing the development of rabies in humans.[17] Other examples include experimental AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease vaccines. Such immunizations aim to trigger an immune response more rapidly and with less harm than natural infection.\nMost vaccines are given by hypodermic injection as they are not absorbed reliably through the intestines. Live attenuated polio, some typhoid, and some cholera vaccines are given orally to produce immunity in the bowel. While vaccination provides a lasting effect, it usually takes several weeks to develop, while passive immunity (the transfer of antibodies) has immediate effect.[18]\nVaccines typically contain one or more adjuvants, used to boost the immune response. Tetanus toxoid, for instance, is usually adsorbed onto alum. This presents the antigen in such a way as to produce a greater action than the simple aqueous tetanus toxoid. People who get an excessive reaction to adsorbed tetanus toxoid may be given the simple vaccine when time for a booster occurs.\nIn the preparation for the 1990 Persian Gulf campaign, pertussis vaccine (not acellular) was used as an adjuvant for anthrax vaccine. This produces a more rapid immune response than giving only the anthrax, which is of some benefit if exposure might be imminent.\nVaccines may also contain preservatives to prevent contamination with bacteria or fungi. Until recent years, the preservative thimerosal was used in many vaccines that did not contain live virus. As of 2005, the only childhood vaccine in the U.S. that contains thimerosal in greater than trace amounts is the influenza vaccine,[19] which is currently recommended only for children with certain risk factors.[20] Single-dose influenza vaccines supplied in the UK do not list thiomersal (its UK name) in the ingredients. Preservatives may be used at various stages of production of vaccines, and the most sophisticated methods of measurement might detect traces of them in the finished product, as they may in the environment and population as a whole.[21]\nThe term inoculation is often used interchangeably with vaccination. However, some argue that the terms are not synonymous. Dr Byron Plant explains: \"Vaccination is the more commonly used term, which actually consists of a 'safe' injection of a sample taken from a cow suffering from cowpox... Inoculation, a practice probably as old as the disease itself, is the injection of the variola virus taken from a pustule or scab of a smallpox sufferer into the superficial layers of the skin, commonly on the upper arm of the subject. Often inoculation was done 'arm to arm' or less effectively 'scab to arm'...\" Inoculation oftentimes caused the patient to become infected with smallpox, and in some cases the infection turned into a severe case.[22] [23]\nVaccinations began in the 18th century with the work of Edward Jenner and the smallpox vaccine.[24] [25] [26]\nVaccines work by presenting a foreign antigen to the immune system to evoke an immune response, but there are several ways to do this. Four main types are currently in clinical use:\nAn inactivated vaccine consists of virus or bacteria that are grown in culture and then killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde. Although the virus or bacteria particles are destroyed and cannot replicate, the virus capsid proteins or bacterial wall are intact enough to be recognized and remembered by the immune system and evoke a response. When manufactured correctly, the vaccine is not infectious, but improper inactivation can result in intact and infectious particles. Since the properly produced vaccine does not reproduce, booster shots are required periodically to reinforce the immune response.\nIn an attenuated vaccine, live virus or bacteria with very low virulence are administered. They will replicate, but locally or very slowly. Since they do reproduce and continue to present antigen to the immune system beyond the initial vaccination, boosters may be required less often. These vaccines may be produced by passaging, for example, adapting a virus into different host cell cultures, such as in animals, or at suboptimal temperatures, allowing selection of less virulent strains, or by mutagenesis or targeted deletions in genes required for virulence. There is a small risk of reversion to virulence, which is smaller in vaccines with deletions. Attenuated vaccines also cannot be used by immunocompromised individuals. Reversions of virulence were described for a few attenuated viruses of chickens (infectious bursal disease virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus [5], avian metapneumovirus [6])[27]\nVirus-like particle vaccines consist of viral protein(s) derived from the structural proteins of a virus. These proteins can self-assemble into particles that resemble the virus from which they were derived but lack viral nucleic acid, meaning that they are not infectious. Because of their highly repetitive, multivalent structure, virus-like particles are typically more immunogenic than subunit vaccines (described below). The human papillomavirus and Hepatitis B virus vaccines are two virus-like particle-based vaccines currently in clinical use.\nA number of other vaccine strategies are under experimental investigation. These include DNA vaccination and recombinant viral vectors.\nIt is known that the process of inoculation was used by Chinese physicians in the 10th century.[28] Scholar Ole Lund comments: \"The earliest documented examples of vaccination are from India and China in the 17th century, where vaccination with powdered scabs from people infected with smallpox was used to protect against the disease. Smallpox used to be a common disease throughout the world and 20 to 30% of infected persons died from the disease. Smallpox was responsible for 8 to 20% of all deaths in several European countries in the 18th century. The tradition of vaccination may have originated in India in AD 1000.\"[29] The mention of inoculation in the Sact'eya Grantham, an Ayurvedic text, was noted by the French scholar Henri Marie Husson in the journal Dictionaire des sciences m\u00c3\u00a9dicales.[30] Inoculation was reportedly widely practised in China in the reign of the Longqing Emperor (r. 1567\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1572) during the Ming Dynasty (1368\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1644).[31] The Greek physicians Emmanuel Timonis (1669-1720) from Chios island and Jacob Pylarinos (1659-1718) from Kefallonia island practised smallpox inoculation at Constantinople in the beginning of 18th century [32] and published their work in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1714.[33] [34] This kind of inoculation and other forms of variolation were introduced into England by Lady Montagu, a famous English letter-writer and wife of the English ambassador at Istanbul between 1716 and 1718, who almost died from smallpox as a young adult and was physically scarred from it. Inoculation was adopted both in England and in America nearly half a century before Jenner's famous smallpox vaccine of 1796[35] but the death rate of about 2% from this method meant that it was mainly used during dangerous outbreaks of the disease and remained controversial.[36]\nIt was noticed during the 18th century that people who had suffered from the less virulent cowpox were immune to smallpox, and the first recorded use of this idea was by a farmer Benjamin Jesty at Yetminster in Dorset, who had suffered the disease and transmitted it to his own family in 1774, his sons subsequently not getting the mild version of smallpox when later inoculated in 1789. But it was Edward Jenner, a doctor in Berkeley in Gloucestershire, who established the procedure by introducing material from a cowpox vesicle on Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid, into the arm of a boy named James Phipps. Two months later he inoculated the boy with smallpox and the disease did not develop. In 1798 Jenner published An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vacciniae, which coined the term vaccination and created widespread interest. He distinguished 'true' and 'spurious' cowpox (which did not give the desired effect) and developed an \"arm-to-arm\" method of propagating the vaccine from the vaccinated individual's pustule. Early attempts at confirmation were confounded by contamination with smallpox, but despite controversy within the medical profession and religious opposition to the use of animal material, by 1801 his report was translated into six languages and over 100,000 people were vaccinated.[37]\nSince then vaccination campaigns have spread throughout the globe, sometimes prescribed by law or regulations (See Vaccination Acts). Vaccines are now used against a wide variety of diseases besides smallpox. Louis Pasteur further developed the technique during the 19th century, extending its use to killed agents protecting against anthrax and rabies. The method Pasteur used entailed treating the agents for those diseases so they lost the ability to infect, whereas inoculation was the hopeful selection of a less virulent form of the disease, and Jenner's vaccination entailed the substitution of a different and less dangerous disease for the one protected against. Pasteur adopted the name vaccine as a generic term in honor of Jenner's discovery.\nMaurice Hilleman was the most prolific vaccine inventor, and developed successful vaccines for measles, mumps, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, meningitis, pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae.[38]\nIn modern times, the first vaccine-preventable disease targeted for eradication was smallpox. The World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated this global eradication effort. The last naturally occurring case of smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977. In 1988, the governing body of WHO targeted polio for eradication by 2000. Although the target was missed, eradication is very close. The next disease to be targeted for eradication would most likely be measles, which has declined since the introduction of measles vaccination in 1963.[citation needed]\nIn 2000, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization was established to strengthen routine vaccinations and introduce new and under-used vaccines in countries with a per capita GDP of under US$1000. GAVI is now entering its second phase of funding, which extends through 2014.\nTo eliminate the risk of outbreaks of some diseases, at various times several governments and other institutions have employed policies requiring vaccination for all people. For example, an 1853 law required universal vaccination against smallpox in England and Wales, with fines levied on people who did not comply. Common contemporary U.S. vaccination policies require that children receive common vaccinations before entering public school.\nBeginning with early vaccination in the nineteenth century, these policies were resisted by a variety of groups, collectively called antivaccinationists, who object on scientific, ethical, political, medical safety, religious, and other grounds. Common objections are that vaccinations do not work, that compulsory vaccination represents excessive government intervention in personal matters, or that the proposed vaccinations are not sufficiently safe.[39] Many modern vaccination policies allow exemptions for people who have compromised immune systems, allergies to the components used in vaccinations or strongly held objections.[40]\nIn countries with limited financial resources, limited coverage causes much morbidity and mortality.[41] More affluent countries are able to subsidize vaccinations for at-risk groups, resulting in more comprehensive and effective coverage. In Australia, for example, the Government subsidizes vaccinations for seniors and indigenous Australians.[42]\nPublic Health Law Research, an independent US based organization, reported in 2009 that there is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of requiring vaccinations as a condition for specified jobs as a means of reducing incidence of specific diseases among particularly vulnerable populations;[43] that there is sufficient evidence supporting the effectiveness of requiring vaccinations as a condition for attending child care facilities and schools;[44] and that there is strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of standing orders, which allow healthcare workers without prescription authority to administer vaccine as a public health intervention aimed at increasing vaccination rates.[45]\nIn the MMR vaccine controversy, a fraudulent 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield, originally published in The Lancet, presented supposed evidence that the MMR vaccine (an immunization against measles, mumps and rubella that is typically first administered to children shortly after their first birthday) was linked to the onset of autism spectrum disorders.[46] The article was widely criticized for lack of scientific rigour, partially retracted in 2004 by Wakefield's co-authors,[47] and was fully retracted by The Lancet in 2010.[48] Wakefield was struck off the UK's medical registry for the fraud.[49]\nThis Lancet article has sparked a much greater anti-vaccination movement, primarily in the United States. Even though the article was fraudulent and was retracted, 1 in 4 parents still believe vaccines can cause autism.[50] Many parents do not vaccinate their children because they feel that diseases are no longer present due to all the vaccinations.[51] This is a false assumption, since some diseases could still return. These pathogens could possibly infect vaccinated people, due to the pathogen's ability to mutate when it is able to live in unvaccinated hosts. In 2010, there was a whooping cough outbreak in California that was the worst outbreak in 50 years. A possible contributing factor was parents choosing not to vaccinate their children.[52] There was also a case in Texas in 2012 where 21 members of a church contracted measles because they chose not to immunize.[52]\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has compiled a list of vaccines and their possible side effects.[53] Allegations of vaccine injuries in recent decades have appeared in litigation in the U.S. Some families have won substantial awards from sympathetic juries, even though most public health officials have said that the claims of injuries were unfounded.[54] In response, several vaccine makers stopped production, which the US government believed could be a threat to public health, so laws were passed to shield makers from liabilities stemming from vaccine injury claims.[54] The safety and side effects of multiple vaccines have been tested in order to uphold the viability of vaccines as a barrier against disease. Vaccines, such as the Influenza vaccination, were tested in controlled trials to be proven to have negligible side effects equal to that of a placebo.[55] Some concerns from families might have arisen from social beliefs and norms that cause them to mistrust or refuse to use vaccinations, contributing to this discrepancy in side effects that were unfounded.[56]\nA vaccine administration may be oral, by injection (intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous), by puncture, transdermal or intranasal.[57] Several recent clinical trials have aimed to deliver the vaccines via mucosal surfaces to be up-taken by the common mucosal immunity system, thus avoiding the need for injections.[58]\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that vaccination averts 2-3 million deaths per year (in all age groups), and up to 1.5 million children die each year due to diseases which could have been prevented by vaccination.[59] They estimate that 29% of deaths of children under five years old in 2013 were vaccine preventable. In other developing parts of the world, they are faced with the challenge of having a decreased availability of resources and vaccinations. Countries such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa cannot afford to provide the full range of childhood vaccinations.[60] The increasing rates of vaccinations will have lasting effects on future generations; the greater the group of people who become vaccinated can ultimately drive down the spread of infection through herd immunity.\nVaccines have led to major progressions within the United States battle against disease. In 2007, studies regarding the effectiveness of vaccines on mortality or morbidity rates of those exposed to various diseases have shown almost 100% decreases in death rates, and about a 90% decrease in exposure rates.[61] This has allowed specific organizations and states to adopt standards for recommended early childhood vaccinations. Lower income families who are unable to otherwise afford vaccinations are supported by these organizations and specific government laws. The Vaccine for Children Program and the Social Security Act are two major players in supporting lower socioeconomic groups.\nGND: 4026656-4\n\u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u201e\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8\u00b1\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9\u0160\u00d8\u00a9 \nAz\u00c9\u2122rbaycanca \nB\u00c3\u00a2n-l\u00c3\u00a2m-g\u00c3\u00ba \n\u00d0\u2018\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00bb\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u20ac\u00d1\u0192\u00d1\ufffd\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\ufffd \n\u00d0\u2018\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00bb\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u20ac\u00d1\u0192\u00d1\ufffd\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\ufffd (\u00d1\u201a\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u20ac\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u02c6\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00b2\u00d1\u2013\u00d1\u2020\u00d0\u00b0)\u200e \n\u00d0\u2018\u00d1\u0160\u00d0\u00bb\u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u20ac\u00d1\ufffd\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8 \nBosanski \n\u00c4\u0152e\u00c5\u00a1tina \nDansk \nDeutsch \nDin\u00c3\u00a9 bizaad \nEesti \n\u00d9\ufffd\u00d8\u00a7\u00d8\u00b1\u00d8\u00b3\u00db\u0152 \nFran\u00c3\u00a7ais \nGaeilge \nGalego \n\u00ed\u2022\u0153\u00ea\u00b5\u00ad\u00ec\u2013\u00b4 \n\u00d5\u20ac\u00d5\u00a1\u00d5\u00b5\u00d5\u00a5\u00d6\u20ac\u00d5\u00a5\u00d5\u00b6 \n\u00e0\u00a4\u00b9\u00e0\u00a4\u00bf\u00e0\u00a4\u00a8\u00e0\u00a5\ufffd\u00e0\u00a4\u00a6\u00e0\u00a5\u20ac \nHrvatski \nBahasa Indonesia \nItaliano \n\u00d2\u0161\u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00b7\u00d0\u00b0\u00d2\u203a\u00d1\u02c6\u00d0\u00b0 \nKrey\u00c3\u00b2l ayisyen \n\u00d0\u0161\u00d1\u2039\u00d1\u20ac\u00d0\u00b3\u00d1\u2039\u00d0\u00b7\u00d1\u2021\u00d0\u00b0 \nL\u00c3\u00abtzebuergesch \nLimburgs \nLing\u00c3\u00a1la \n\u00d0\u0153\u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00b4\u00d0\u00be\u00d0\u00bd\u00d1\ufffd\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8 \nBahasa Melayu \nNederlands \nO\u00ca\u00bbzbekcha\/\u00d1\u017e\u00d0\u00b7\u00d0\u00b1\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00ba\u00d1\u2021\u00d0\u00b0 \n\u00e0\u00a8\u00aa\u00e0\u00a9\u00b0\u00e0\u00a8\u0153\u00e0\u00a8\u00be\u00e0\u00a8\u00ac\u00e0\u00a9\u20ac \nPortugu\u00c3\u00aas \n\u00d0\u00a0\u00d1\u0192\u00d1\ufffd\u00d1\ufffd\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b9 \nSimple English \nSloven\u00c4\ufffdina \nSloven\u00c5\u00a1\u00c4\ufffdina \n\u00da\u00a9\u00d9\u02c6\u00d8\u00b1\u00d8\u00af\u00db\u0152\u00db\u0152 \u00d9\u2020\u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u02c6\u00db\u2022\u00d9\u2020\u00d8\u00af\u00db\u0152 \n\u00d0\u00a1\u00d1\u20ac\u00d0\u00bf\u00d1\ufffd\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8 \/ srpski \nSrpskohrvatski \/ \u00d1\ufffd\u00d1\u20ac\u00d0\u00bf\u00d1\ufffd\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00be\u00d1\u2026\u00d1\u20ac\u00d0\u00b2\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u201a\u00d1\ufffd\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8 \nSuomi \nSvenska \nTagalog \nT\u00c3\u00bcrk\u00c3\u00a7e \n\u00d0\u00a3\u00d0\u00ba\u00d1\u20ac\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u2014\u00d0\u00bd\u00d1\ufffd\u00d1\u0152\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b0 \nTi\u00e1\u00ba\u00bfng Vi\u00e1\u00bb\u2021t \nV\u00c3\u00b5ro \nWest-Vlams \nWinaray \n\u00e0\u00a4\u00a1\u00e0\u00a5\u2039\u00e0\u00a4\u0178\u00e0\u00a5\u2021\u00e0\u00a4\u00b2\u00e0\u00a5\u20ac\n","55":"Measles vaccine is a vaccine that is very effective at preventing measles.[1] After one dose 85% of children nine months of age and 95% over twelve months of age are immune.[2] Nearly all of those who do not develop immunity after a single dose develop it after a second dose.[1] When rates of vaccination within a population are greater than ~92% outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur; however, they may occur again if rates of vaccination decrease.[1] The vaccine's effectiveness lasts many years.[1] It is unclear if it becomes less effective over time.[1] The vaccine may also protect against the disease if given within a couple of days of being exposed.[1]\nThe vaccine is generally safe including in those with HIV infections.[1] Side effects are usually mild and short lived.[1] This may include pain at the site of injection or mild fever.[1] Anaphylaxis has been documented in about 3.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 cases per million doses.[1] Rates of Guillain\u00e2\u20ac\u201cBarr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome, autism and inflammatory bowel disease do not appear to be increased.[1]\nThe vaccine is available both by itself and in combination with other vaccines. This includes with the rubella vaccine and mumps vaccine to make the MMR vaccine,[1] first made available in 1971.[3] The addition of the varicella vaccine against chickenpox to these three in 2005 gave the MMRV vaccine.[4] The vaccine works equally well in all formulations.[1] The World Health Organization recommends it be given at nine months of age in areas of the world where the disease is common.[1] In areas where the disease is not common, giving it at twelve months is reasonable.[1] It is a vaccine based on a live but weakened strain of measles.[1] It comes as a dried powder which needs to be mixed with a specific liquid before being given either just under the skin or into a muscle.[1] Verification that the vaccine was effective can be determined by blood tests.[1]\nAbout 85% of children globally have received this vaccine as of 2013.[5] In 2008 at least 192 countries offered two doses.[1] It was first introduced in 1963.[2] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[6] The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.70 USD per dose as of 2014.[7]\nBefore the widespread use of the measles vaccine, its incidence was so high that infection with measles was felt to be \"as inevitable as death and taxes.\"[8] In the United States, reported cases of measles fell from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands per year following introduction of the vaccine in 1963 (see chart at right). Increasing uptake of the vaccine following outbreaks in 1971 and 1977 brought this down to thousands of cases per year in the 1980s. An outbreak of almost 30,000 cases in 1990 led to a renewed push for vaccination and the addition of a second vaccine to the recommended schedule. Fewer than 200 cases were reported each year from 1997 to 2013, and the disease was believed no longer endemic in the United States.[9] [10] [11] In 2014, 610 cases were reported.[12] Roughly 30 cases were diagnosed in January 2015, likely originating from exposure near Anaheim, California in late December 2014.\nThe benefit of measles vaccination in preventing illness, disability, and death has been well documented. The first 20 years of licensed measles vaccination in the U.S. prevented an estimated 52 million cases of the disease, 17,400 cases of mental retardation, and 5,200 deaths.[13] During 1999\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2004, a strategy led by the World Health Organization and UNICEF led to improvements in measles vaccination coverage that averted an estimated 1.4 million measles deaths worldwide.[14] The vaccine for measles has led to the near-complete elimination of the disease in the United States and other developed countries.[15] It was introduced in 1963.[16] These impressive reductions in death and long-range after-effectiveness were initially achieved with a live virus version of the vaccine that itself caused side effects, although these are far fewer and less serious than the sickness and death caused by measles itself. While preventing many deaths and serious illnesses, the live virus version of the vaccine did cause side effects in a small percentage of recipients, ranging from rashes to, rarely, convulsions.[17]\nMeasles is common worldwide. Although it was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, high rates of vaccination and excellent communication with those who refuse vaccination are needed to prevent outbreaks and sustain the elimination of measles in the U.S.[18] Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated individual who acquired measles during a visit to Romania.[19] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; 9% were hospitalized, and the cost of containing the outbreak was estimated at $167,685. A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities.[18]\nThe live vaccine has non specific effects such as preventing respiratory infections that may be greater than those of measles prevention. These benefits were greater when used before a year of age. A high titre vaccine resulted in worse outcomes in girls and thus is no longer recommended by the world health organization.[20] As measles causes upper respiratory disease that leads to complications of pneumonia and bronchitis, measles vaccine is beneficial to reduce exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.\nThe World Health Organization recommends two doses of vaccine for all children.[1] In countries with high risk of disease the first dose should be given around nine months of age.[1] Otherwise in low risk countries it can be given at twelve months of age.[1]The second dose should be given at least one month after the first dose.[1] This is often done at age 15 to 18 months.[1]\nThe CDC recommends that children aged 6 to 12 months traveling outside the United States receive their first dose of MMR vaccine.[21] Otherwise the first dose is typically given between 12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 months. A second dose is given by 7 years (on or before last day of year 6) or by Kindergarten entry.[22] Vaccine is administered in the outer aspect of the upper arm. In adults, it is give subcutaneously and a second dose 28 days apart is given. In adults greater than 50 years, only one dose is needed.\nAdverse effects associated with the MMR vaccine include fever, injection site pain and, in rare cases, red or purple discolorations on the skin known as thrombocytopenic purpura, or seizures related to fever (febrile seizure).[23] Serious side effects are extremely rare.[citation needed]\nThere is no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.[24] [25] [26] [27] The MMR vaccine does not appear to cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.[28]\nAs a fellow at Children's Hospital Boston, Dr. Thomas C. Peebles worked with Dr. John Franklin Enders. Dr. Enders became known as \"The Father of Modern vaccines\", and Enders shared the Nobel Prize in 1954 for his research on cultivating the polio virus that led to the development of a vaccination for the disease. Switching to study measles, Enders sent Peebles to Fay School in Massachusetts, where an outbreak of the disease was under way, and there Peebles was able to isolate the virus from some of the blood samples and throat swabs he had taken from the students. Even after Enders had taken him off the study team, Peebles was able to cultivate the virus and show that the disease could be passed on to monkeys inoculated with the material he had collected.[15] Enders was able to use the cultivated virus to develop a measles vaccine in 1963 based on the material isolated by Peebles.[31] In the late 1950s and early 1960s, nearly twice as many children died from measles as from polio.[32] The vaccine Enders developed was based on the Edmonston strain of attenuated live measles virus, which was named for the Fay student from whom Peebles had taken the culture that led to the virus's cultivation.[33]\nThe first ever trials of measles vaccine were undertaken by David Morley at the Wesley Guild Hospital in Ilesha, Nigeria[34] on his own children.\nDr. Maurice Hilleman at Merck & Co., a pioneer in the development of vaccinations, developed the MMR vaccine in 1971, which treats measles, mumps and rubella in a single shot followed by a booster.[17] [35] One form is called \"Attenuvax\" with more than 40 peptide sequences.[36] The measles component of the MMR vaccine uses Attenuvax, which is grown in a chick embryo cell culture using the Enders' attenuated Edmonston strain. Merck decided not to resume production of attenuvax on October 21, 2009.[37]\nMeasles is seldom given as an individual vaccine and is often given in combination with mumps and rubella. Two types of measles vaccines are currently available.\nMeasles mumps rubella vaccine (MMR-II); MMR vaccine is a live attenuated viral vaccine used to induce immunity against measles, mumps and rubella.\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x World Health Organization (28 April 2017). \"Measles vaccines: WHO position paper \u00e2\u20ac\u201c April 2017\" (PDF).

They can be used to prevent rabies before and for a period of time after exposure to the virus such as by a dog or bat bite. The immunity that develops is long lasting after three doses. Doses are usually given by injection into the skin or muscle. After exposure vaccination is typically used along with rabies immunoglobulin. It is recommended that those who are at high risk of exposure be vaccinated before potential exposure. Vaccines are effective in humans and other animals. Vaccinating dogs is very effective in preventing the spread of rabies to humans.[1]\nRabies vaccines may be safely used in all age groups. About 35 to 45 percent of people develop a brief period of redness and pain at the injection site. About 5 to 15 percent of people may have fever, headaches, or nausea. After exposure to rabies there is no contraindication to its use. Most vaccines do not contain thimerosal. Vaccines made from nerve tissue are used in a few countries, mainly in Asia and Latin America, but are less effective and have greater side effects. Their use is thus not recommended by the World Health Organization.[1]\nThe first rabies vaccine was introduced in 1885, which was followed by an improved version in 1908.[2] Millions of people globally have been vaccinated and it is estimated that this saves more than 250,000 people a year.[1] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[3] The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 44 and 78 USD for a course of treatment as of 2014.[4] In the United States a course of rabies vaccine is more than 750 USD.[5]\nThe World Health Organization recommends vaccinating in those who are at high risk of the disease including children who live in areas where it is common.[1] Four doses are given over a one-month period.[1]\nImmunity following a course of doses is typically long lasting.[1] Additional doses are not typically needed except in those at very high risk.[1] Following administration of a booster dose, one study found 97% of immuno-competent individuals demonstrate protective levels of neutralizing antibodies at 10 years.[6]\nThe human diploid cell rabies vaccine (H.D.C.V.) was started in 1967. Human diploid cell rabies vaccines are inactivated vaccines made using the attenuated Pitman-Moore L503 strain of the virus.[7] Human diploid cell rabies vaccines have been given to more than 1.5 million people as of 2006.[citation needed]\nIn addition to these developments, newer and less expensive purified chicken embryo cell vaccine, and purified Vero cell rabies vaccine are now available. The purified Vero cell rabies vaccine uses the attenuated Wistar strain of the rabies virus, and uses the Vero cell line as its host.\nVirtually every infection with rabies resulted in death until two French scientists, Louis Pasteur and \u00c3\u2030mile Roux, developed the first rabies vaccination in 1885. This vaccine was first used on a human on July 6, 1885, on nine-year-old Joseph Meister (1876\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1940), who had been mauled by a rabid dog.[8]\nTheir vaccine consisted of a sample of the virus harvested from infected (and necessarily dead) rabbits, which was weakened by allowing it to dry for 5 to 10 days. Similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines are still used now in some countries, and while they are much cheaper than modern cell culture vaccines, they are not as effective.[citation needed] Neural tissue vaccines also carry a certain risk of neurological complications.[9]\nPre-exposure immunization has been used on domesticated and wild populations. In many jurisdictions, domestic dogs, cats, ferrets, and rabbits are required to be vaccinated.\nAside from vaccinating humans, another approach was also developed by vaccinating dogs to prevent the spread of the virus. In 1979 the Van Houweling Research Laboratory of the Silliman University Medical Center in Dumaguete in the Philippines,[10] developed and produced a dog vaccine that gave a three-year immunity from rabies. The development of the vaccine resulted in the elimination of rabies in many parts of the Visayas and Mindanao Islands. The successful program in the Philippines was later used as a model by other countries, such as Ecuador and the Yucatan State of Mexico, in their fight against rabies conducted in collaboration with the World Health Organization.[11]\nIn Tunisia a rabies control program was initiated to give dog owners free vaccination to promote mass vaccination which was sponsored by their government. The vaccine is known as Rabisin (M\u00c3\u00a9rial), which is a cell based rabies vaccine only used countrywide. Vaccinations are often administered when owners take in their dogs for check-ups and visits at the vet.[12]\nThere is also vaccination in pellet form which can be left out for wild animals to produce a herd immunity effect.[13] Oral vaccination against rabies is a preventive measure to eradicate rabies in wild animals, vectors of disease, mainly foxes, raccoons, raccoon dogs, coyotes and jackals, but also can be used for dogs in developing countries.[14] Baits are distributed by airplanes in rural areas and by hand in urban and suburban areas. The idea of wildlife vaccination was conceived during the 1960s, and modified-live rabies viruses were used for the experimental oral vaccination of carnivores by the 1970s. The development of safe and effective rabies virus vaccines applied in attractive baits resulted in the first field trials in Switzerland in 1978.[15]\nImrab is an example of a veterinary rabies vaccine containing the Pasteur strain of killed rabies virus. Several different types of Imrab exist, including Imrab, Imrab 3, and Imrab Large Animal. Imrab 3 has been approved for ferrets and, in some areas, pet skunks.[16] [17]\n","57":"For other uses, see Vaccine (disambiguation).\nA vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters. Vaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by a natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g., vaccines against cancer are being investigated).[1] [2] [3] [4]\nThe administration of vaccines is called vaccination. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example, the influenza vaccine,[5] the HPV vaccine,[6] and the chicken pox vaccine.[7] Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases;[8] widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available to prevent or contribute to the prevention and control of twenty-five infections.[9]\nThe terms vaccine and vaccination are derived from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Edward Jenner to denote cowpox. He used it in 1798 in the long title of his Inquiry into the...Variolae vaccinae...known...[as]...the Cow Pox, in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox.[10] In 1881, to honor Jenner, Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms should be extended to cover the new protective inoculations then being developed.[11]\nVaccines have historically been the most effective means to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. Limitations to their effectiveness, nevertheless, exist.[12] Sometimes, protection fails because the host's immune system simply does not respond adequately or at all. Lack of response commonly results from clinical factors such as diabetes, steroid use, HIV infection or age.[citation needed] It also might fail for genetic reasons if the host's immune system includes no strains of B cells that can generate antibodies suited to reacting effectively and binding to the antigens associated with the pathogen.\nEven if the host does develop antibodies, protection might not be adequate; immunity might develop too slowly to be effective in time, the antibodies might not disable the pathogen completely, or there might be multiple strains of the pathogen, not all of which are equally susceptible to the immune reaction. However, even a partial, late, or weak immunity, such as a one resulting from cross-immunity to a strain other than the target strain, may mitigate an infection, resulting in a lower mortality rate, lower morbidity, and faster recovery.\nAdjuvants commonly are used to boost immune response, particularly for older people (50\u00e2\u20ac\u201c75 years and up), whose immune response to a simple vaccine may have weakened.[13]\nThe efficacy or performance of the vaccine is dependent on a number of factors:\nIf a vaccinated individual does develop the disease vaccinated against (breakthrough infection), the disease is likely to be less virulent than in unvaccinated victims.[16]\nThe following are important considerations in the effectiveness of a vaccination program:[citation needed]\nIn 1958, there were 763,094 cases of measles in the United States; 552 deaths resulted.[17] [18] After the introduction of new vaccines, the number of cases dropped to fewer than 150 per year (median of 56).[18] In early 2008, there were 64 suspected cases of measles. Fifty-four of those infections were associated with importation from another country, although only 13% were actually acquired outside the United States; 63 of the 64 individuals either had never been vaccinated against measles or were uncertain whether they had been vaccinated.[18]\nVaccines have contributed to the eradication of smallpox, one of the most contagious and deadly diseases in humans. Other diseases such as rubella, polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox, and typhoid are nowhere near as common as they were a hundred years ago. As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This effect is called herd immunity. Polio, which is transmitted only between humans, is targeted by an extensive eradication campaign that has seen endemic polio restricted to only parts of three countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan).[19] However, the difficulty of reaching all children as well as cultural misunderstandings have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times.\nVaccination given during childhood is generally safe.[20] Adverse effects if any are generally mild.[21] The rate of side effects depends on the vaccine in question.[21] Some common side effects include fever, pain around the injection site, and muscle aches.[21] Additionally, some individuals may be allergic to ingredients in the vaccine.[22] MMR vaccine is rarely associated with febrile seizures.[20]\nSevere side effects are extremely rare.[20] Varicella vaccine is rarely associated with complications in immunodeficient individuals and rotavirus vaccines are moderately associated with intussusception.[20]\nVaccines are dead or inactivated organisms or purified products derived from them.\nThere are several types of vaccines in use.[23] These represent different strategies used to try to reduce the risk of illness while retaining the ability to induce a beneficial immune response.\nMain article: Inactivated vaccine\nSome vaccines contain inactivated, but previously virulent, micro-organisms that have been destroyed with chemicals, heat, radiation, or antibiotics.[citation needed] Examples are influenza, cholera, bubonic plague, polio, hepatitis A, and rabies.[citation needed]\nMain article: Attenuated vaccine\nSome vaccines contain live, attenuated microorganisms. Many of these are active viruses that have been cultivated under conditions that disable their virulent properties, or that use closely related but less dangerous organisms to produce a broad immune response. Although most attenuated vaccines are viral, some are bacterial in nature. Examples include the viral diseases yellow fever, measles, rubella, and mumps, and the bacterial disease typhoid. The live Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccine developed by Calmette and Gu\u00c3\u00a9rin is not made of a contagious strain but contains a virulently modified strain called \"BCG\" used to elicit an immune response to the vaccine. The live attenuated vaccine containing strain Yersinia pestis EV is used for plague immunization. Attenuated vaccines have some advantages and disadvantages. They typically provoke more durable immunological responses and are the preferred type for healthy adults. But they may not be safe for use in immunocompromised individuals, and may rarely mutate to a virulent form and cause disease.[24]\nToxoid vaccines are made from inactivated toxic compounds that cause illness rather than the micro-organism.[citation needed] Examples of toxoid-based vaccines include tetanus and diphtheria. Toxoid vaccines are known for their efficacy.[citation needed] Not all toxoids are for micro-organisms; for example, Crotalus atrox toxoid is used to vaccinate dogs against rattlesnake bites.[citation needed]\nProtein subunit\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than introducing an inactivated or attenuated micro-organism to an immune system (which would constitute a \"whole-agent\" vaccine), a fragment of it can create an immune response.[citation needed] Examples include the subunit vaccine against Hepatitis B virus that is composed of only the surface proteins of the virus (previously extracted from the blood serum of chronically infected patients, but now produced by recombination of the viral genes into yeast),[citation needed] the virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) that is composed of the viral major capsid protein,[citation needed] and the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits of the influenza virus.[citation needed] Subunit vaccine is being used for plague immunization.[citation needed]\nConjugate\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c certain bacteria have polysaccharide outer coats that are poorly immunogenic. By linking these outer coats to proteins (e.g., toxins), the immune system can be led to recognize the polysaccharide as if it were a protein antigen.[citation needed] This approach is used in the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine.[citation needed]\nA number of innovative vaccines are also in development and in use:\nWhile most vaccines are created using inactivated or attenuated compounds from micro-organisms, synthetic vaccines are composed mainly or wholly of synthetic peptides, carbohydrates, or antigens.\nVaccines may be monovalent (also called univalent) or multivalent (also called polyvalent). A monovalent vaccine is designed to immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism.[28] A multivalent or polyvalent vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism, or against two or more microorganisms.[29] The valency of a multivalent vaccine may be denoted with a Greek or Latin prefix (e.g., tetravalent or quadrivalent). In certain cases, a monovalent vaccine may be preferable for rapidly developing a strong immune response.[30]\nAlso known as heterologous or \"Jennerian\" vaccines, these are vaccines that are pathogens of other animals that either do not cause disease or cause mild disease in the organism being treated. The classic example is Jenner's use of cowpox to protect against smallpox. A current example is the use of BCG vaccine made from Mycobacterium bovis to protect against human tuberculosis.[31]\nVarious fairly standardized abbreviations for vaccine names have developed, although the standardization is by no means centralized or global. For example, the vaccine names used in the United States have well-established abbreviations that are also widely known and used elsewhere. An extensive list of them provided in a sortable table and freely accessible, is available at a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web page.[32] The page explains that \"The abbreviations [in] this table (Column 3) were standardized jointly by staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ACIP Work Groups, the editor of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), the editor of Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (the Pink Book), ACIP members, and liaison organizations to the ACIP.\"[32] Some examples are \"DTaP\" for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, \"DT\" for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and \"Td\" for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. At its page on tetanus vaccination,[33] the CDC further explains that \"Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case 'd' and 'p' denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent\/adult-formulations. The 'a' in DTaP and Tdap stands for 'acellular,' meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\"[33] Another list of established vaccine abbreviations is at the CDC's page called \"Vaccine Acronyms and Abbreviations\", with abbreviations used on U.S. immunization records.[34] The United States Adopted Name system has some conventions for the word order of vaccine names, placing head nouns first and adjectives postpositively. This is why the USAN for \"OPV\" is \"poliovirus vaccine live oral\" rather than \"oral poliovirus vaccine\".\nThe immune system recognizes vaccine agents as foreign, destroys them, and \"remembers\" them. When the virulent version of an agent is encountered, the body recognizes the protein coat on the virus, and thus is prepared to respond, by (1) neutralizing the target agent before it can enter cells, and (2) recognizing and destroying infected cells before that agent can multiply to vast numbers.\nWhen two or more vaccines are mixed together in the same formulation, the two vaccines can interfere. This most frequently occurs with live attenuated vaccines, where one of the vaccine components is more robust than the others and suppresses the growth and immune response to the other components. This phenomenon was first noted in the trivalent Sabin polio vaccine, where the amount of serotype 2 virus in the vaccine had to be reduced to stop it from interfering with the \"take\" of the serotype 1 and 3 viruses in the vaccine.[35] This phenomenon has also been found to be a problem with the dengue vaccines currently being researched,[when?] where the DEN-3 serotype was found to predominate and suppress the response to DEN-1, \u00e2\u02c6\u20192 and \u00e2\u02c6\u20194 serotypes.[36]\nIn order to provide the best protection, children are recommended to receive vaccinations as soon as their immune systems are sufficiently developed to respond to particular vaccines, with additional \"booster\" shots often required to achieve \"full immunity\". This has led to the development of complex vaccination schedules. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends schedule additions for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends routine vaccination of children against:[37] hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, HiB, chickenpox, rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal disease and pneumonia.[38] A large number of vaccines and boosters recommended (up to 24 injections by age two) has led to problems with achieving full compliance. In order to combat declining compliance rates, various notification systems have been instituted and a number of combination injections are now marketed (e.g., Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and MMRV vaccine), which provide protection against multiple diseases.\nBesides recommendations for infant vaccinations and boosters, many specific vaccines are recommended for other ages or for repeated injections throughout life\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmost commonly for measles, tetanus, influenza, and pneumonia. Pregnant women are often screened for continued resistance to rubella. The human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended in the U.S. (as of 2011)[39] and UK (as of 2009).[40] Vaccine recommendations for the elderly concentrate on pneumonia and influenza, which are more deadly to that group. In 2006, a vaccine was introduced against shingles, a disease caused by the chickenpox virus, which usually affects the elderly.\nPrior to the introduction of vaccination with material from cases of cowpox (heterotypic immunisation), smallpox could be prevented by deliberate inoculation of smallpox virus, later referred to as variolation to distinguish it from smallpox vaccination.The earliest hints of the practice of inoculation for smallpox in China come during the 10th century.[41] The Chinese also practiced the oldest documented use of variolation, dating back to the fifteenth century. They implemented a method of \"nasal insufflation\" administered by blowing powdered smallpox material, usually scabs, up the nostrils. Various insufflation techniques have been recorded throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries within China.[42] :60 Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers.[43]\nSometime during the late 1760s whilst serving his apprenticeship as a surgeon\/apothecary Edward Jenner learned of the story, common in rural areas, that dairy workers would never have the often-fatal or disfiguring disease smallpox, because they had already had cowpox, which has a very mild effect in humans. In 1796, Jenner took pus from the hand of a milkmaid with cowpox, scratched it into the arm of an 8-year-old boy, and six weeks later inoculated (variolated) the boy with smallpox, afterwards observing that he did not catch smallpox.[44] [45] Jenner extended his studies and in 1798 reported that his vaccine was safe in children and adults and could be transferred from arm-to-arm reducing reliance on uncertain supplies from infected cows.[10] Since vaccination with cowpox was much safer than smallpox inoculation,[46] the latter, though still widely practised in England, was banned in 1840.[47] The second generation of vaccines was introduced in the 1880s by Louis Pasteur who developed vaccines for chicken cholera and anthrax,[11] and from the late nineteenth century vaccines were considered a matter of national prestige, and compulsory vaccination laws were passed.[44]\nThe twentieth century saw the introduction of several successful vaccines, including those against diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella. Major achievements included the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s and the eradication of smallpox during the 1960s and 1970s. Maurice Hilleman was the most prolific of the developers of the vaccines in the twentieth century. As vaccines became more common, many people began taking them for granted. However, vaccines remain elusive for many important diseases, including herpes simplex, malaria, gonorrhea and HIV.[44] [48]\nOpposition to vaccination, from a wide array of vaccine critics, has existed since the earliest vaccination campaigns.[53] Although the benefits of preventing serious illness and death from infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare serious adverse effects following immunization,[54] disputes have arisen over the morality, ethics, effectiveness, and safety of vaccination. Some vaccination critics say that vaccines are ineffective against disease[55] or that vaccine safety studies are inadequate.[55] Some religious groups do not allow vaccination,[56] and some political groups oppose mandatory vaccination on the grounds of individual liberty.[53] In response, concern has been raised that spreading unfounded information about the medical risks of vaccines increases rates of life-threatening infections, not only in the children whose parents refused vaccinations, but also in those who cannot be vaccinated due to age or immunodeficiency, who could contract infections from unvaccinated carriers (see herd immunity).[57] Some parents believe vaccinations cause autism, although there is no scientific evidence to support this idea.[58] In 2011, Andrew Wakefield, a leading proponent of one of the main controversies regarding a purported link between autism and vaccines, was found to have been financially motivated to falsify research data and was subsequently stripped of his medical license.[59] In the United States people who refuse vaccines for non-medical reasons have made up a large percentage of the cases of measles, and subsequent cases of permanent hearing loss and death caused by the disease.[60]\nOne challenge in vaccine development is economic: Many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine, including HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, exist principally in poor countries. Pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases, because there is little revenue potential. Even in more affluent countries, financial returns are usually minimal and the financial and other risks are great.[61]\nMost vaccine development to date has relied on \"push\" funding by government, universities and non-profit organizations.[62] Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health.[63] The number of vaccines actually administered has risen dramatically in recent decades.[64] This increase, particularly in the number of different vaccines administered to children before entry into schools may be due to government mandates and support, rather than economic incentive.[citation needed]\nThe filing of patents on vaccine development processes can also be viewed as an obstacle to the development of new vaccines. Because of the weak protection offered through a patent on the final product, the protection of the innovation regarding vaccines is often made through the patent of processes used in the development of new vaccines as well as the protection of secrecy.[65]\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the biggest barrier to local vaccine production in less developed countries has not been patents, but the substantial financial, infrastructure, and workforce expertise requirements needed for market entry. Vaccines are complex mixtures of biological compounds, and unlike the case of drugs, there are no true generic vaccines. The vaccine produced by a new facility must undergo complete clinical testing for safety and efficacy similar to that undergone by that produced by the original manufacturer. For most vaccines, specific processes have been patented. These can be circumvented by alternative manufacturing methods, but this required R&D infrastructure and a suitably skilled workforce. In the case of a few relatively new vaccines such as the human papillomavirus vaccine, the patents may impose an additional barrier.[66]\nVaccine production has several stages. First, the antigen itself is generated. Viruses are grown either on primary cells such as chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza) or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells (e.g., for hepatitis A).[67] Bacteria are grown in bioreactors (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b). Likewise, a recombinant protein derived from the viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast, bacteria, or cell cultures. After the antigen is generated, it is isolated from the cells used to generate it. A virus may need to be inactivated, possibly with no further purification required. Recombinant proteins need many operations involving ultrafiltration and column chromatography. Finally, the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant, stabilizers, and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant enhances the immune response of the antigen, stabilizers increase the storage life, and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials.[68] [69] Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce, because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved.[70]\nVaccine production techniques are evolving. Cultured mammalian cells are expected to become increasingly important, compared to conventional options such as chicken eggs, due to greater productivity and low incidence of problems with contamination. Recombination technology that produces genetically detoxified vaccine is expected to grow in popularity for the production of bacterial vaccines that use toxoids. Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain, and thereby decrease undesirable interactions, by using pathogen-associated molecular patterns.[70]\nIn 2010, India produced 60 percent of the world's vaccine worth about $900 million(\u00e2\u201a\u00ac670 million).[71]\nBeside the active vaccine itself, the following excipients and residual manufacturing compounds are present or may be present in vaccine preparations:[72]\nMany vaccines need preservatives to prevent serious adverse effects such as Staphylococcus infection, which in one 1928 incident killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative.[74] Several preservatives are available, including thiomersal, phenoxyethanol, and formaldehyde. Thiomersal is more effective against bacteria, has a better shelf-life, and improves vaccine stability, potency, and safety; but, in the U.S., the European Union, and a few other affluent countries, it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines, as a precautionary measure due to its mercury content.[75] Although controversial claims have been made that thiomersal contributes to autism, no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims.[76]\nThe development of new delivery systems raises the hope of vaccines that are safer and more efficient to deliver and administer. Lines of research include liposomes and ISCOM (immune stimulating complex).[77]\nNotable developments in vaccine delivery technologies have included oral vaccines. Early attempts to apply oral vaccines showed varying degrees of promise, beginning early in the 20th century, at a time when the very possibility of an effective oral antibacterial vaccine was controversial.[78] By the 1930s there was increasing interest in the prophylactic value of an oral typhoid fever vaccine for example.[79]\nAn oral polio vaccine turned out to be effective when vaccinations were administered by volunteer staff without formal training; the results also demonstrated increased ease and efficiency of administering the vaccines. Effective oral vaccines have many advantages; for example, there is no risk of blood contamination. Vaccines intended for oral administration need not be liquid, and as solids, they commonly are more stable and less prone to damage or to spoilage by freezing in transport and storage.[80] Such stability reduces the need for a \"cold chain\": the resources required to keep vaccines within a restricted temperature range from the manufacturing stage to the point of administration, which, in turn, may decrease costs of vaccines.\nA microneedle approach, which is still in stages of development, uses \"pointed projections fabricated into arrays that can create vaccine delivery pathways through the skin\".[81]\nAn experimental needle-free[82] vaccine delivery system is undergoing animal testing.[83] [84] A stamp-size patch similar to an adhesive bandage contains about 20,000 microscopic projections per square cm.[85] This dermal administration potentially increases the effectiveness of vaccination, while requiring less vaccine than injection.[86]\nThe use of plasmids has been validated in preclinical studies as a protective vaccine strategy for cancer and infectious diseases. However, in human studies, this approach has failed to provide clinically relevant benefit. The overall efficacy of plasmid DNA immunization depends on increasing the plasmid's immunogenicity while also correcting for factors involved in the specific activation of immune effector cells.[87]\nSee also: Influenza vaccine \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0Flu vaccine for nonhumans, and Vaccination of dogs\nVaccinations of animals are used both to prevent their contracting diseases and to prevent transmission of disease to humans.[88] Both animals kept as pets and animals raised as livestock are routinely vaccinated. In some instances, wild populations may be vaccinated. This is sometimes accomplished with vaccine-laced food spread in a disease-prone area and has been used to attempt to control rabies in raccoons.\nWhere rabies occurs, rabies vaccination of dogs may be required by law. Other canine vaccines include canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, adenovirus-2, leptospirosis, bordatella, canine parainfluenza virus, and Lyme disease, among others.\nCases of veterinary vaccines used in humans have been documented, whether intentional or accidental, with some cases of resultant illness, most notably with brucellosis.[89] However, the reporting of such cases is rare and very little has been studied about the safety and results of such practices. With the advent of aerosol vaccination in veterinary clinics for companion animals, human exposure to pathogens that are not naturally carried in humans, such as Bordetella bronchiseptica, has likely increased in recent years.[89] In some cases, most notably rabies, the parallel veterinary vaccine against a pathogen may be as much as orders of magnitude more economical than the human one.\nDIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) vaccines make it possible to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals.\nDIVA vaccines carry at least one epitope less than the microorganisms circulating in the field. An accompanying diagnostic test that detects antibody against that epitope allows us to actually make that differentiation.\nThe first DIVA vaccines (formerly termed marker vaccines and since 1999 coined as DIVA vaccines) and companion diagnostic tests have been developed by J.T. van Oirschot and colleagues at the Central Veterinary Institute in Lelystad, The Netherlands.[90] [91] They found that some existing vaccines against pseudorabies (also termed Aujeszky's disease) had deletions in their viral genome (among which the gE gene). Monoclonal antibodies were produced against that deletion and selected to develop an ELISA that demonstrated antibodies against gE. In addition, novel genetically engineered gE-negative vaccines were constructed.[92] Along the same lines, DIVA vaccines and companion diagnostic tests against bovine herpesvirus 1 infections have been developed.[93] [94]\nThe DIVA strategy has been applied in various countries and successfully eradicated pseudorabies virus. Swine populations were intensively vaccinated and monitored by the companion diagnostic test and, subsequently, the infected pigs were removed from the population. Bovine herpesvirus 1 DIVA vaccines are also widely used in practice.\nScientists have put and still, are putting much effort in applying the DIVA principle to a wide range of infectious diseases, such as, for example, classical swine fever,[95] avian influenza,[96] Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia[97] and Salmonella infections in pigs.[98]\nPrinciples that govern the immune response can now be used in tailor-made vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune disorders.[104] For example, the experimental vaccine CYT006-AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure.[105] Factors that have an impact on the trends of vaccine development include progress in translatory medicine, demographics, regulatory science, political, cultural, and social responses.[106]\nTransgenic plants have been identified as promising expression systems for vaccine production. Complex plants such as tobacco, potato, tomato, and banana can have genes inserted that cause them to produce vaccines usable for humans.[107] Bananas have been developed that produce a human vaccine against Hepatitis B.[108] Another example is the expression of a fusion protein in alfalfa transgenic plants for the selective directioning to antigen presenting cells, therefore increasing vaccine potency against Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV).[109] [110]\n^ Bol, K., et al.

March 1998) found that a causal relationship exists between live measles vaccine and encephalopathy after analyzing cases of children who received measles vaccine alone or in the combination MMR shot and, within 15 days of vaccination, suffered neurologic signs that progressed to death or mental regression, retardation, chronic seizures, motor and sensory deficits and movement disorders.---BL Fisher http:\/\/www.nvic.org\nI was just looking at this same info on my son's vaccine papers.\u00c2\u00a0 The moderate symptoms of some vaccines are \"staring\" or absence seizures.\u00c2\u00a0 I did not know this and was not informed of this at the time of his shots.\u00c2\u00a0 my son was perfectly fine for 4 1\/2 years we go to get vaccinated for school in 12\/09 and he starts to have symptoms later that month and in Feb\/2010 he is dx with seizures.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Something isn't right, we need to\u00c2\u00a0be doing more research on this guys.\u00c2\u00a0\nwow. how sad. and disgusting. and horrible. thank you for this discussion. i keep searching for epilepsy in conjunction with vaccine injury. lots out there in regards to autism, but not necessarily just epilepsy.\u00c2\u00a0 \n my 2 year old daughter received a combo shot (PEDIARIX) of dtap, polio and hep b. 2 days later she has complex partial seizure, secondary generalization, status epilepticus. at the ER, no one paid any attention when i said she'd just had a vaxx. 6 weeks later, another seizure, same type, but needed 4 medical interventions to stop it after over an hour. ambulance, hospitalizations, and now an epilepsy diagnosis. almost $25,000 in medical bills. our local neuro as well as neuro at mayo clinic dismiss, scold the notion that a vaxx is involved. i am BEYOND angry. i hope the greedy big pharma machine is happy with their money while my daughter, family suffers.\u00c2\u00a0 \nseeing a DAN doctor now, working on ways to treat her.\u00c2\u00a0 if this has happened to you\/your kids, please go see a DAN doctor.\u00c2\u00a0 \nwould welcome comments from others in same situation or updates from some of these older comments. i wonder how these kids from 6-7 years ago are doing now??\nI'm very new to epilepsy and in the stages of researching it awaiting our first eeg, so if i'm using the wrong names for my descriptions, please forgive me and please do correct me as i'm only learning. My daughter had her first seizure about 12 hours after her mmr shot at 12 months. When i contacted the administering GP we were told it was a normal reaction to the vaccination febrile seizure, and it will not happen again. from then on she started having myoclonic seizures where her eyes would roll for a split second. when i mentioned this to the gp they said, those will go away with time. instead of going away they have increased in length and frequency. within 6 months i have started noticing absence seizures around 3-5 seconds long periods of spacing out, from which i couldn't get her out. gradually the eye flutters have been joined by an arm jerk. that's when i was sure this wasn't going to go away and requested an appointment (very long waiting times to see a neurologist here...). as she started to have night episodes of a series of myoclonic and absence seizures in rapid succession we got 'fast tracked' but still waiting for the appointment.\nall this time while talking to gps they all deny any connection between the mmr shot and the seizures, they refuse to register this as a vaccine reaction. if she has had hit her head 12 hours prior to having the first seizure, this would have been the explanation, but in the case of vaccines there's a wall of denial.\nMy son had his 1st seizure IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE 1-2 minutes after receiving two vaccinations. The seizures continued from that day forward. Three years later, the FDA\n and the CDC began a study to investigate the increase in reports of seizure following the Flu vaccine. In July 2011, I read that the preliminary results indicated that there is an increased risk of seizure when the Flu vaccine is given in conjunction with other vaccines, although the risk is less than 10%, with less than 1% of those children going on to develop a residual seizure disorder. We just happened to be in that less than 1% of 10% :-(\u00c2\u00a0 Of course, the VAERS \"table\" did not list seizure as an adverse reaction at the time that my son's problems began. The doctor informed me that there was no evidence of a link between the shots and my son's immediate adverse reaction so there was nothing to report&quot. The compensation program is very clear about a 3 year statute of limitations that begins from the date of injury, rather than the date of diagnosis - or the date of recognition by the medical community. Consequently, my son's problems, while reported to the pediatrician, were never reported to VAERS, so we're on our own trying to help him :-(\nIf your child has been injured by a vaccine, the people who can help you are called DAN! doctors: http:\/\/www.google.com.my\/search?q=dan+doctor\nThe method of treatment is called biomedical treatment: http:\/\/www.google.com.my\/search?q=what+is+biomedical+treatment\nThis is your best option as conventional medicine offers nothing more than suppression of symptoms with drugs that further damage the brain. \nGood luck!\nI have a 3\/12 year old daughter that started having seizures 9 days after her 1st MMR vaccine at 21 mon.\u00c2\u00a0 But that is not the first sign of something wrong with these vaccines.\u00c2\u00a0 At 2 months just after her vaccines she started crying uncontrollably the Dr., said it may be from the DTap shot so we decided not to give the pertussis part of the shot in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 With her 3rd round I waited until she was 19 months and only got the Hep B and PCV, she had no reaction.\u00c2\u00a0 Then the 4th round at 21 months is when she got the MMR and the Hep B.\u00c2\u00a0 This is when she had what they say is a febrile seizure, she was not sick and no one in the house was.\u00c2\u00a0 She just woke up with a fever and she was having a seizure, strange.\u00c2\u00a0 Funny how the 2 vaccines (pertussis and MMR) they say may cause seizures are the ones my daughter had reactions to.\u00c2\u00a0 I have not given her any more vaccines since then as I truly believe that this is what has triggered the seizures.\u00c2\u00a0 She had another seizure at 3 years of age on her birthday, which lasted at least 40 minutes and they had to use drugs to bring her out of it.\u00c2\u00a0 She has since been on Keppra and was doing fine until I missed a couple of doses in a row and today she had another seizure which lasted just a couple of minutes.\u00c2\u00a0 The Dr's will not even go there in saying that the vaccines are the cause, when I bring it up they just move on to something else.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 This is what is frustrating, can't they just say well maybe but that would mean going against the BIG Drug companies.\u00c2\u00a0 I will not give my child any further vaccines.\u00c2\u00a0 They say there is evidence that says they don't cause Autism or any other problems, well I am sorry but you can't take a vaccine out of a child once they have been given it, so how can they prove this?\nWhat is the thought on yearly flu shots ?? I work in healthcare and they really push flu shots yearly to prevent a out break of some terrible flu.\n Do the flu shots make seizures worse if so I rather not have them . Is there any data on that ? \nI thought about this as I don't really like the thought of mixing more chemicals with my AEDs that could cause side effects .\nWhen I was being trained as a Neurodiagnostic Tech. , I only saw one young child w\/ a reaction. I am sorry to read of others that have had reaction.\u00c2\u00a0 I pray things get better. \nWhen I had\u00c2\u00a0my first baby, \u00c2\u00a0I questioned this and the pediatrician reassured me that they would be fine and gave me\u00c2\u00a0a small ratio of 2:100,000 would get a reaction. That was in a ratio of normal patients and then told me 3,4:100,000.\u00c2\u00a0 He reassured me that I was very healthy not worry about it. \nMy second child, I was on more medication, she is very healthy and is going to high school next year.\u00c2\u00a0 My first is my son, he\u00c2\u00a0is going for his Eagle Scout and is rebuilding storage units, for people in transition\u00c2\u00a0during this time period.\u00c2\u00a0 \nCan some vaccines (not all vaccines) possibly cause a few cases of epilepsy here and there (not all cases of epilepsy)?  Likely answer:  yes (my view).  The topic of vaccines is a hot topic because of business interests\/business guilds.  Vaccines are such a hot topic that major efforts have been made to silence discussion of vaccines (example:  the United Kingdom - autism and possible linkage to the MMR vaccine).  My view today is that there likely have been a few cases of epilepsy\/whatever due to some vaccines or bad batches of vaccines but again, there are economic\/business forces which attempt to censor discussion of the topic - forces which are similar to non-profit religions which pontificate from Salt Lake City or Mecca or Rome - aka a variation of Eisenhower's military-industrial complex aka the vaccines-industrial complex\/whatever.  If bad batches\/whatever of vaccines cause neurological challenges, then efforts must be made to make changes here and there to reduce this\/ideally prevent it.  Bottomline:  Do vaccines cause all of epilepsy?  No, not at all.  Many cases of epilepsy are due to causes other than vaccines such as car accidents, etc.  In general I tend to look at vaccines a little like food additives - there are a few cases (a handful of instances) of extreme sensitivities to a few food additives but those few cases are quite different than saying all the world's neurological challenges are due to food additives or vaccines or lack of megadoses and megadoses of Vitamin C\/whatever, or the fluoride in the water.  Is it clear that the vaccine question can open up the possibility of litigation for damages and that threat may be such that the vaccines\/industrial complex will use the tobacco industry approach:  there is not a shred of evidence that tobacco causes health problems - why President Ronald Reagan even promoted the sales of Chesterfield cigarettes so we all know that smoking must be healthy, right?  Why not have vaccines carry a caution label which says something like:  Most persons who receive this vaccine can tolerate it, however, in a few cases side-effects can result;  however, if that happens, the people responsible for the vaccines will automatically deny it and move on using the proven principle of:  business as usual.  Also, sorry, no refunds.  Have a good day.  Words:  attempted humor, humor, irony, sarcasm, business as usual, hey - life is not fair, morality as defined by the Homer Simpson TV show\/the All In The Family TV show (Archie Bunker), etc.\nI am a soldier in the U.S. Army and I did not start having seizures until I had vaccanations to go over seas... it was my first seizure ever.. and now they have gotten worse.. so this is my reason I do believe vaccines can cause seizures... I wish this upon no one, no matter how mad they make me!! Hope everyone lives a normal and healthy life!! GOD BLESS!!\nWe do not vaccinate and have two kids with epilepsy. So in our case at least, we know for sure the cause is not vaccinations. Neither of our kids have had any vaccinations.\nMy son is now 6years old and has been having seizures since he had his first vaccine at 2mths of age, He had his first seizure about 36 hrs after his needle. He did not have any fever, actually has never had a febril seizure ever, but has had a multitude of others. We did not have any more innoculations given to him. When he started school we signed an exempt form due to medical reasons. He has been in school now for 3 years. I also read \"A Shot in the Dark\" 51\/2 years ago. It scared the &?%& out of me! I was so thank full that my husband agreed with me when we did nothave Sean innoculated anymore.\u00c2\u00a0 \nGod Bless \n\u00c2\u00a0Dawn\nHey infantyman11B,\nMy name is Joe and my wife and I were also in the Army.  She began having seizures days after deployment vaccines as well.  PLEASE try to contact me on here, as I would love to talk about your progress, medications if any, symptoms, legal action???\nJoe\ni am so so very sorry and angry for what has happened to your daughter. i am also new to epilepsy, about 6 months since my daughter's 1st seizure. i know how scary, confusing, devastating it can be. and when children like yours and mine have a seizure after a vaccination and then all doctors involved refuse to even discuss a possible connection, it is an outrage. all i ever wanted was a conversation. i have yet to get one from any conventional doctor, whether a pediatrician, neurologist. according to the package insert of the shot my daughter received, seizures ARE LISTED AS A SIDE EFFECT. in light of that, we deserve a conversation. unfortunately, i beleive that no matter what doctor you see, they will never admit a connection due to liability. \ni was able to have a conversation with an integrative m.d., who is also a trained DAN doctor in our area. i would suggest that you find a DAN doctor for your daughter to see. they WILL discuss what has happened, and they do have treatments to help your child. we see our DAN doctor in conjuction with our local pediatric neurologist (who by the way does not agree with DAN protocol). we are the parents so it is our choice how to treat our child. unfortunately, our health insurance does not cover most of the DAN doctor's services, due to his independent, non-pharmaceutical stance. we pay for the services out of pocket.\u00c2\u00a0 \ni would also suggest that you get a copy of your child's medical record, including the name, lot # of the shot she received prior to the seizure.\u00c2\u00a0 take all your info and contact a vaccine lawyer (personal injury type lawyer dealing specifically with vaccine injury). yes, there are actually VACCINE lawyers due to the high numbers of injury from vaccines. there is a special vaccine court set up by the fed. gov't to hear these cases. you very well may have a case. this will cost you nothing. the lawyers are paid out of a fund set up by the gov't. it is worth it to try.\u00c2\u00a0\nalso, you should go to the VAERS website and report the incident. YOU CAN REPORT it even if your doctor won't. keep a copy of the report and your report number for reference. in fact, keep a whole file with all medical records, reports. you will no doubt need all this reference again.\u00c2\u00a0\nagain, i am so sorry. i am so, so angry about what is happening to my child and yours, and the countless other well meaning parents who faithfully trust their doctors and allow these vaccinations only to watch their child suffer the consequences.\u00c2\u00a0 people are profitting off this. it makes me sick. i wish i had known better.\u00c2\u00a0 \nplease feel free to private message me.\u00c2\u00a0\nThank you for your reply,\n It makes me so angry too, I wish i had researched vaccines before i blindly went for it. I trusted our medical professionals and would never have questioned the vaccine system until this. It's really hard to deal with the feeling of guilt over this, but that's another subject I guess.\n We live in Ireland and I have tried for nearly two years to get my hands on a report form to let someone know about this, but i keep getting fobbed off by the Health Services and it seems the only way to report this is through a GP, who are all refusing to do this.\n Thanks for the tip on getting a copy of our vaccine schedule and medical record, i will get onto this asap.\n Needless to say my daughter will not receive any more shots. And every time i say that to a GP i get a lecture on how dangerous measles is, that it can be deadly. Honestly, in hindsight, I'd rather her have gotten the natural immunity to measles, as unpleasant as it is (I know as i've had it) than suffer from Epi for the rest of her life, as from what i've read, this kind of Epi is unlikely to go away.\n Of to google what a DAN doctor is.\n Thanks again and hope your child (and mine) get better\nI just wanted you to know that I agree with you. My son Carter was a healthy baby until his 4 month old shots the night of his shots he started with his first of many seizures.  He is now diagnosed with epilepsy and still having seisures. What is unbeleivable to me is the Doctors dont even acknowlege it was the vaccines.\nI agree. My daughter started having seizures within 48 hours of her 6 month shots and I still can't get any doctor to listen to that. She has myoclonic seizures and one of the rare side effects of DTaP is absence or jerking seizures...HELLO PEOPLE!! Now I'm afraid to give her any vaccines for fear that they will make her condition worse.\nThe more I read about vaccines the more unhappy I become. I'm leaning towards giving no more vaccines to my child and to not give any to future children. I know many don't agree with that, and 9 months ago I was in that group, now though, I would give anything to go back to her birth and tell them no vaccines until age 2.\nJenn\nI just logged for the first time in a long while. My son has been having neurological problems, seizures, movements that doctors aren't sure what to call, etc. since last May. He was a healthy 18 mos. old little boy and then 11 days after his checkup (vaccines) he vommitted and had a 1+ hour seizure. We lived in the hospital for over 50 days on and off with different doctors looking at different things. He has had genetic tests including a muscle biopsy and everything was normal. Different people, family members and friends have mentioned the possibility of this being caused by vaccines. All of his doctors dismiss that right away. My son has several developmental setbacks. He no longer sits up or stands or uses his hands. My family is hurting so much, does anyone have any advise for us. We need help. S\nYour story sounds alot like mine.\u00c2\u00a0 My son started having seizures right after his 6 month vaccines.\u00c2\u00a0 He had two febrile seizures and then one that last 68 minutes long in the ER at Childrens.\u00c2\u00a0 Not one doctor asked about his vaccines.\u00c2\u00a0 To this day, not one doctor has acknowledged it could his vaccines.\u00c2\u00a0 I read Jenny McCarthy's book Mother Warriors.\u00c2\u00a0 I know that is about children with Autism but I was shocked by all the characteristics they have in common.\u00c2\u00a0 Seizures, rahes and stomach issues.\u00c2\u00a0 I am going to call tomorrow and take my son to a DAN!doctor.\u00c2\u00a0 He has been on two anticonvulsant meds and neither have worked.\u00c2\u00a0 Keppra made his aggresive and violent.\u00c2\u00a0 Trileptal causes him to have more frequent seizures.\u00c2\u00a0 He has had 9 in the past month whereas he had 8 in only 7 months.\u00c2\u00a0 His seizures would only come while he was sleeping at first.\u00c2\u00a0 Now that he is on the medicine, they are coming while he is taking a bath, standing in line at a carnival, playing at McDonalds or riding in the car.\u00c2\u00a0 So I had to ask myself, \"Why am I putting him on a medicine that is only making him worse?\" I am going to try the DAN! doctor way and see what happens.\u00c2\u00a0 I was wondering if you had tried this type of method?\nI am a lawyer in Houston, Texas. My firm reprensents several parents of children who have received these shots and then suffered seizure disorders. In effort to learn more about this and to get in contact with doctors who believe in the connection I have been researching online. If any person reading this has any information, experiences, or names of doctors that they feel would be helpful please contact me at texasvaccinelawyer@gmail.com.\nI'm so happy to find this site! My grandson and his mother lives with me and my husband and when he received the 1st series of dTap shots he had his first seizure at 4 months within 12 hours after receiving the shot. It lasted over an hour and the attending\n ER doc didn't believe us about the length of his seizures. No break, just constant seizing. He was transferred to a city hospital (we live in a small town) and the attending doctor there said that vaccination shots could cause seizures. Later,he change his story and said\n it was a virus that caused the seizure. However, another doctor said that vaccination shots could cause seizures. Then another\n doctor said it was a febrile seizures. We spent 4 days in the hospital where 5 different doctors couldn't agree on why he suffered\n a seizure. I read \"A Shot in the Dark\" after speaking with my naturopathic doctor and was scare myself. I used to wonder why my\n grandkids were getting so many vaccinations shots at such a young age when my generation didn't nor did my parents! My grandson\n suffered another seizure after my daughter was pressured to continue his vaccination shots, ( I wasn't there to provide support\n in her decision not to vaccinate him anymore) at 6 months. Still the doctors wouldn't admit it was the vaccination shots. After his\n 2nd seizure I wouldn't allow my grandson to be vaccinated anymore but I believe the damage is done. Everytime my grandson gets\n a virus in his system he suffers a seizure that last on average 30 minutes or longer! No brain damage and these are grand mal\n seizures. Praise God he's still a happy and lovable baby. He'll be 2 in a couple of weeks but we're still walking on eggshells waiting\n for the next seizure to hit when he's ill. I'm checking out that DAN! doctor info and the ketogenic diet.\nHi,\n I'm new to this site.  Your story sounds very similiar to mine.  My son started with his first seizure activity the morning after his 6 month shots, one being DTAP.  He was diagnosed at 8 months with a seizure disorder and put on meds.  As of now he is 21 months old and is still on meds, mostly controlled.  It amazes me and sadens me how neither his pediatrician or neurologist thinks there is a correlation.  I have not had any more shots given to my son so far.  Still I have alot of worry about harming him by giving more immunizations.  I'm not sure what I'll do at his 2 year checkup.\nRead the book \"A Shot in the Dark\" and then decide. It was very helpful for me. For example, did you know that vaccines contain formaldehyde and milk protein as well as the active ingredients? Would you let someone shoot formaldehyde into your child's veins if you knew it was there? Very informative book.\nI made my decisions based on the individual vaccine, the risks of the vaccine, the risks of the disease it was protecting against, the effectiveness of the vaccines (They are not 100% effective anyway). For example, tetanus is the one vaccine that does not currently have a risk of death associated with it. Also, for many vaccines, the government has a fund set up for children who have been \"damaged\" by the vaccine. My son's seizure with his first vaccine is on record with the Health Department only because I called in and went through the interrogation necessary to get it recorded. This should be, but is generally not, done by the doctor. Just some info.\nKim\nthis is what happend to my son Christopher ,he was born normal and at about 4 months he started having seizures too..I still think it was vaccines because it was during that time . After the shot he got sick vomitting ,fever then the siezure and of course the Doctors say it`s not possible .\nMy oldest boy suffered seizures from the MMR shot when he was 15 months after he received his immunization shots. They would not give him his MMR shots after that. If there is any questions about that immunizations he doesn't receive it and gets a letter from his physician explaining why the child does not receive the immunization. When the child turned almost 16 he has started to develop epileptic seizures now and they are treating them with Lamictal at this point and he seems to be handling it all very well. I would differently look into what immunization is causing the child to have the seizure and refuse for the child to continue to have the immunization. I also have a friend that suffered from a reaction from a seizure from the polia shot when it first come into effect and now suffers serve seizures from it and has some other serve side effects from it. So I would be very careful on what you continue to provide your child on immunization shots to your child because obviously one of them are not agreeing with the child.\nid have to agree mine had her 6 month needles then the siezures started im only knew at this stuff and only found out to nights ago that she now has epilepsy i duno what sort of epilepsy as i didnt know there was heaps of different types shes now 2 years old and stil having them shes on epilim but makes her go crazy and uncontrolable i duno if its just the meds and docs are suggesting up the doasage\n","59":"    Crown Princess Mary of Denmark and WHO Regional Director for Europe encourage Moldovan parents to continue vaccinating their children  07-12-2016   \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Immunization saves lives. Every child has the right to be immunized.\" This was the message of Her Royal Highness The Crown Princess of Denmark during her visit to the Republic of Moldova.\nEach year in April, EIW promotes the core message that the immunization of every child is vital to prevent diseases and protect life. The goal of the region-wide campaign is to increase vaccination coverage by raising awareness of the importance of immunization. EIW 2016 was celebrated on 24\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30 April.\nTools for immunization programme managers and other stakeholders to advocate for prioritization of immunization in political agendas and public health budgets\nOverview of support provided to Member States in pursuing the goals and objectives of the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2020 (EVAP)\nInformation and support for health care professionals\nTools and methodologies to tailor services to the special needs of underserved groups\nWHO\/Europe is proud to announce the launch of a new online resource for the immunization community\n","60":"Under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), are health care providers and vaccine manufacturers required to report adverse events following the administration of vaccines? \nHealth care providers are subject to the adverse event reporting provisions of the NCVIA. This act mandates the reporting of the following events:\nThere are no penalties specified in the law for health care providers who do not report adverse events. However, FDA takes active steps to educate physicians, nurses and other health care workers about the importance of reporting adverse vaccine events.\n[TOP] \nUnder FDA regulations [21 CFR, Subpart D - Reporting of Adverse Experiences, Section 600.80] and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), licensed vaccine manufacturers must report to FDA adverse experience information. FDA has a number of enforcement options at its disposal that can be used if a vaccine manufacturer fails to establish and maintain records, and report adverse events under VAERS.\nIf a manufacturer were to fail to report an adverse event, FDA would warn the firm that it is out of compliance with the law. FDA also would examine the firm's total compliance situation and take further action according to the severity of the reporting violation. If necessary, FDA has the authority to revoke a manufacturer's biological product license for a vaccine.\n[TOP] \nThe agency does not have a formal definition of \"event\". An \"event\" is simply an outcome. Any outcome that an individual, whether a health care provider or consumer, believes may have resulted from an administration of a vaccine, may be reported to VAERS. Any such report will be entered into the system, whether or not there appears to be a causal relation to the vaccine. Thus, there can be no precise definition of \"event,\" since the reporters are the ones who determine what is reported.\n[TOP] \nDue to the success of immunization programs, the incidence of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases has declined. Therefore, individuals are less aware of the serious consequences of vaccine preventable illnesses. While vaccines are extremely safe and effective, no medical product is 100 percent safe or effective. Vaccines have been proven, over decades, to be one of the safest and most powerful disease prevention tools available.\nToday there are far fewer visible reminders of the suffering, injuries, and premature deaths caused by diseases that can now be prevented with vaccines. For most of the vaccine-preventable diseases, there has been a 95 percent or more reduction in incidence. Routine immunization has eradicated smallpox from the globe and eliminated wild polio virus in this country. Vaccines have reduced preventable infectious diseases to an all-time low and few children suffer the devastating effects of these illnesses.\nPrior to approval by FDA, vaccines are extensively tested by scientists to ensure that they are effective and safe. FDA has a stringent regulatory process for licensing vaccines that serves as a model for other countries.\nFor reasons related to the individual, not all vaccinated persons develop immunity. Most routine childhood vaccines are effective for 85% to 95% of recipients. Differences in the way individual immune systems react to a vaccine account for rare occasions when people are not protected following immunization or when they experience side effects. Vaccines are licensed, after stringent testing and study, because the benefits offered to the individual far outweigh the risk of serious health effects. In fact, some risks for serious health effects following vaccination are so rare that they currently cannot be measured.\nImmunization programs optimally prevent the threat of dangerous infectious diseases that threaten the lives of our citizens, especially the Nation's children and elderly. Vaccines are among the 20th century's most successful and cost-effective public health tools for preventing disease, disability, and death.\n[TOP] \nEnacting and enforcing immunization laws and regulations are the responsibility of State governments. CDC supports States' decisions to require certain immunizations as recommended on the Childhood Immunization Schedule for children entering school and childcare facilities. Almost all State immunization mandates pertain to entrance into school and childcare facilities. Many States also have college immunization requirements. States' approaches to exemptions for immunization requirements vary. All States allow medical exemptions for immunization. Forty-eight States permit exemptions for religious reasons and 15 States permit parents to claim exemptions on philosophical grounds. Implementation of religious and philosophical exemptions also varies among States. In some States, immunization program staff review written applications for exemption before granting or denying religious or philosophical exemptions. In other States, parents can obtain exemptions by simply signing a form which is accepted without review.\nState public health laws and regulations are enacted pursuant to the provisions of individual State constitutions. CDC guidelines are voluntary rather than regulatory. CDC works with States that are ultimately responsible for the development and enforcement of school laws. The issue of philosophical exemptions in State laws was reviewed by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC), which is made up of experts in immunization policy. The Committee supports the current policy, which gives States flexibility in developing and enforcing immunization laws. This issue, as well as other immunization issues, are periodically assessed by the NVAC.\n[TOP] \nWhy don't we give parents a choice in deciding if they want to vaccinate their children?\nProtecting a child through immunization is a parent's decision, taken in discussion with their doctor. The Federal Government may recommend that States develop laws or requirements for vaccines, but whether the State includes a given vaccine in its regulations and how informed consent is to be obtained are State decisions. Currently, 48 States allow religious exemptions to vaccination and 15 allow philosophical exemptions, in addition to the medical contraindications that are the same in all 50 States. The rationale for limiting choice is that vaccinations have been a very effective approach to protecting the public's health in the United States. The first article in a series on ten great achievements in public health in the 20th century highlighted the impact of vaccines universally recommended for children (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report; CDC 1999;48:243-48).\nBecause of high vaccine coverage rates today, one may focus on rare, potentially vaccine-associated adverse effects, but before vaccines were introduced there were over 175,000 cases of diphtheria annually (1920-22), over 147,000 cases of Pertussis (1922-25), and over 503,000 cases of measles (1951-54). More recently, an estimated 20,000 cases of invasive infections such as meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b occurred in 1985. Now, because of vaccination, the number of cases of these infections has been decreased by about 96% to 100%. But lessons from other countries have relevance for the United States - 1) if vaccination rates decrease, the number of cases of infection will increase as occurred in the United Kingdom and Japan after concerns about adverse events associated with the whole cell Pertussis vaccine resulted in decreased immunization (In the U.S. today, less reactogenic acellular Pertussis vaccines are now recommended); and 2) the decrease in disease of 96% to 100% exceeds the level of vaccine coverage. This is because at high vaccination rates, the circulation of a bacteria or virus may be decreased which lessens the chance that even someone who has not been immunized will get disease. This \"herd immunity\" is important because some persons can not be vaccinated because of illnesses such as cancer and high vaccination rates in the community will protect them from disease.\n[TOP] \nThis information can be obtained by filing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with FDA. If you would like adverse event information on a specific lot of vaccine, please call 1-800-835-4709 or send an e-mail to ocod@fda.hhs.gov.\n[TOP] \nData demonstrating the stability of a vaccine, including potency data are required to determine the expiry. If a manufacturer wants to extend the dating period, it must submit data to FDA that includes, but is not limited to verification of the potency of the vaccine through the requested new expiry date. If the data demonstrate that the quality of the vaccine is not impacted, then following FDA approval, newly manufactured vaccines will be assigned the new expiry.\n[TOP] \nBecause of the complex manufacturing process for most biological products, each lot undergoes thorough testing by the manufacturer. The manufacturer performs specific tests as specified in their license application. The manufacturer submits samples of each licensed vaccine lot and the results of their own tests for potency, safety, and sterility to the Agency. The manufacturer may not distribute a lot of the product into interstate commerce until CBER releases it. All vaccines are subject to lot release. The lot release program is part of FDA's multi-part strategy that helps assure biological product safety by providing a quality control check on product specifications.\n[TOP]\n","61":"After backing candidate Donald Trump last year, antivaccine activists may feel betrayed in his administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest move to name vaccine advocate Brenda Fitzgerald to run the CDC. At the same time, the medical community will likely breathe a sigh of relief on the nomination.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Tom Price named Fitzgerald to the critical post Friday.\nAfter serving as the Georgia Department of Public Health commissioner and as a state health officer for six years, Fitzgerald will replace acting CDC Director Dr. Anne Schuchat. Before Schuchat, Tom Frieden served as CDC director for 8 years under the Obama Administration.\nIn a series of tweets Friday, Frieden supported the appointment.\nAs head of the CDC, Fitzgerald will be responsible for U.S. vaccination policy and much more.

In the letter, the website\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s editor Jake Crosby brought up Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign promises to look into vaccine safety and pointed out that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153many people voted for you this past election\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because of those promises.\nEven before Fitzgerald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nomination, antivaccine activists were disappointed with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment for FDA head, Scott Gottlieb, who has said any theories of a link between vaccines and autism have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thoroughly debunked.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nRELATED:\u00c2\u00a0Trump's 'not going to back down' from vaccine safety commission, RFK Jr. says after new White House talks \nFor her part, Fitzgerald wrote an op-ed titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Babies need their vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution back in 2014.

Then, I visited with two people today at my office who took every vaccination that was reccomended by their 'travel clinic' (didn't know there was such a thing) and both got sick as dogs during their trip.\n What to do???  One of my favorite quotes is: \"An ounce of prevention is worth a\n Those of you who have experience traveling China, your advice and counsel regarding vaccinations would be appreciated.\nYou do not need proof of innoculations to enter China, only your passport and Visa which you can obtain from a Chinese consulate or embassy in the US ( if that's where you're from.)or  have a visa serivce do it for you for much more money. It is advised that you get typhoid protection in either a series of four pills or by injection. The pills give you longer lasting protection. Your doctor may recommend Hep A as well. I have never had any reactions to any of these shots or pills. Since you're going with Tauck, I would guess you are going to more mainstream cities and areas,  but these precautions area good idea to have no matter where you travel.\n Travel clinics are often found at hospitals affiliated with medical schools. My own internist wrote the Rx for my recent typhoid pills which I got at my local CVS, expensive and not covered by our insurance. Have you looked at the Center for Disease Control website? They have sections and advice for each country.Make sure your tetanus is up to date.If you're leaving in  six weeks, get  any pills or shots now. Do not drink tap water in China.\nVaccinations are not required for entry into China.  However, it is wise to have some vaccinations.  I'd refer you first to the cdc website:  www.cdc.gov\/travel \n Read all of the info about recommended vaccines which include routine vaccines you should have even if you don't travel, like tetanus, appropriate boosters for \"childhood\" diseases like measles\/mumps\/rubella, flu vaccine, and vaccines like hep A (which you'd be wise to have in any case.  \n Print out the cdc info and take it with you to your appointment at a travel med clinic.  If the clinic is advising vaccines that aren't listed, ask why, and if they don't advise vaccines that are listed ask why.  The cdc guidelines are the standard of practice at travel clinics in the US.  \n Certainly people go to CHina and many other places without appropriate vaccines.  But people ride in cars without seats belts and even if they don't get in accidents, it doesn't make it a good idea.  \n The side effects of the vaccines are pretty minor:  sore arm, etc.  The side effects of contracting any of these illnesses is certainly more problematic.  The decision on vaccines should be made in consultation with your doctor.  Get started now - it takes all vaccines some time to be fully effective.\nwww.mdtravelhealth.com China best correct info. It very much depends upon your itinerary and time of year. Biggest risk\n Travelers diarrhea bring meds for this. Hepatitis Flu Pneumonia jabs are warranted in some situations. On upscale tours like tauck.com (very nice have done a couple) others like typhoid yellow fever and malaria preventives usually are NOT indicated. istm.org best site for travel clinics if needed. Public Health Clinics are a good place to find them cheaply in the US.\n Happy Trails!\nDo note that yellow fever is not present in Asia, it is only present in parts of Africa and South America.  If someone at a travel clinic recommends the Yellow fever vaccine to  you for your visit to China - leave.  Typhoid, however is recommended for visits to tropical and semi-tropical areas.  Not knowing your itinerary, I don't know whether it is a good idea.  Diseases like Hep A and typhoid are food and water borne illnesses.  You have no control over (or even knowledge of) how carefully the people who prepare your food wash their hands.\n The pneumonia vaccine is only recommended for people age 65 and above in the US.  And it is recommend for those people whether or not they are traveling.\nI chose to get typhoid (already had Hep A from Egypt) before I went to China just incase.  It was an easy series of pills and I don't remember any side effects from the pills.  The only side effects I remember from the shot was a very slightly sore arm for a day or so.  \n Read the CDC recommendations.  Are you going to be traveling again in the next few (5-10) years to anywhere that the same vaccinations are recommended?  If you are, why not just get the vaccination and be done with it?  \n As for getting sick from the vaccinations, I don't *think* Hep A or Typhoid are live vaccinations.  If they're not live you can't get sick from them (and even for the live vaccinations the risk of getting sick from it is absolutely miniscule unless you're immunosuppressed).  \n Vaccinations don't prevent you from getting sick from everything, they prevent you from getting that particular illness.  Your friends who got sick likely just had run of the mill travelers diarrhea (ate something that just didn't sit well or slight food poisoning that led to a few bad days) or even just a cold\/flu bug picked up in the airports\/airplanes on the way over.\n As someone pointed out above, you have no control over the people preparing your food.  Why risk it?\nTetanus shots, absolutely. and the Hep shots.\n I always get the full complement of shots for travel to any destination, and I used to do quite a bit of international travel. Why take a chance? \n CDC website is very good. You'll need to know which are the essential shots.\n Don't go to any travel clinic, find a good one.\n Safe travels!\nThis thread is why Fodors is one of my favorite travel sites...can always count on solid, sincere and intelligent advice.\n Thanks to everyone for taking your time to share your experiences...very persuasive; your advice to go ahead with the vaccinations just makes sense...as 'easytraveler' said, \"why take the chance?\" And 'Yes' Iowa_Redhead, we will be traveling to several countries over the next few years, so, your right - why not go ahead and get them over with.\n Now, the real challenge is to get my wonderful, incredible (and determined not to) wife to get the vaccinations with me.  Oh, boy, now the work begins!  \n Rock\n<<<Now, the real challenge is to get my wonderful, incredible (and determined not to) wife to get the vaccinations with me. Oh, boy, now the work begins! >>>\n If it helps, your normal doctor should be able to give you (or give you the prescription for) any of the vaccinations you might need.  CDC is the go to source for travel vaccination info, your doctor will use this same info. I highly suggest reading the page on China and reading about the specific vaccinations suggested. http:\/\/wwwnc.cdc.gov\/travel\/destinations\/china.htm \n Tetanus - this one really should be up to date anyway. \n Hep A - \"Cases of travel-related hepatitis A can also occur in travelers to developing countries with \"standard\" tourist itineraries, accommodations, and food consumption behaviors.\" (Quote from the CDC link).  Even on normal itineraries and nothing rural there's still a risk.  Food handlers are your big risk here and you can't do anything to control that.  No serious side effects have been reported from the vaccine. \n Hep B - This one is from blood\/body fluids but I think there's a combo vaccine for Hep A and Hep B so you don't have more needle pokes.  \n Typhoid - Think bad water\/food for this one and again, it's something that you often have little control over.  The vaccine is NOT 100% effective but 50-80%.  This one can be given as pills (I think it was one pill every other day for 4 pills).\n You could be looking at 1 shot and 1 series of 4 pills, not too scary. \n Good luck with the discussion!  Do try to get into your doc as soon as possible as the vaccines do need time to take effect.  Thus far China has been one of my absolute favorite places in the world and I would go back in a heartbeat.  Learn how to say please and thank you in Chinese, have fun bargaining and you'll have a fantastic time!\nNot all cities have travel clinics, which are convenient for the most exotic immunizations such as yellow fever which an internist will not have. \n Otherwise your internist\/family doctor should be able to advise you what to take, eg tetanus, hepA, flu, pneumonia, depending on who you are, healthy, young or older, etc. Better to do that than trying to decipher the CDC website.\n Most immunizations have effective titer rise within 2 weeks.\n Using a hand sanitizer at all times, taking 1-2 Pepto-bismal pills after each meal and drinking only treated water should go a long ways to help keep you healthy.\nThe Hepatitis A vaccine is good even if you don't travel. It protects you from food borne hepatitis just from eating at a local restaurant or consuming contaminated fruit\/produce.\n Tetanus now also contains a component to protect you against Pertussis (whooping cough). You'll be given a Tdap which is \"tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis\". Anyone who doesn't know how long it's been since their last tetanus shot should get it updated regardless of travel plans.\nokoshi2002 brings up something else I was concerned about - what I should take and use that's 'over the counter?' \n I've been told to take Pepto-Bismol in 'pill' form; Imodium, hand wipes (always wash the hands), lots of snack\/energy bars, and this one surprised me..a roll of toilet paper. (say it ain't so) Seems there's a very small portion of our tour that is 'off the beaten path' and I've been told that restroom facilities in certain locations are not exactly up to western standards.  This tid-bid almost almost \"X'ed\" the trip for my wife but she said \"to heck with it, I'm going to see China.\" \n Here's a question for you: now that you have returned home from China, and knowing what you know from your previous trip\/s, if you go again, what will you be sure to take this next time that you wish you had taken previously?\n All tips and advice are greatly appreciated for this '1st time' China traveler.\n Tks.\nWe went to China in 2001 and again in  Fall 2011. We saw huge changes this last trip. We were  off of the beaten path and therefore still dealt with squat toilets everywhere we went. I actually encountered them in the ultra nice upscale shopping center attached to the Grand Hyatt in Beijing, The Malls at Oriental Plaza. A tip is that if you see a handicapped sign on a stall door, that one will be western style.Take Purel and a small package of kleenex with you  when you go out for the day.However, if flying within China, be aware that the airport security may confiscate the Purel since it has an alcohol base..so also have wipes too.\n We found western style drug stores in Beijing and Shanghai(Watson's) but I would take along cold pills, a Pepto bismal type product, handi wipes\/purel, Aleve for muscle soreness,.I also pack moles skin in case of blisters. We always ate with chopsticks. Friends of ours went a tour and never saw a squat toilet, but the opposite was true for us on both of our trips.\n I think it depends where a tour group is taken, how westernized the places are.\n We love China, the food, history,and it's ancient culture. You'll have a great time.\nI actually would suggest against taking something like Pepto on a daily basis just as a preventative.  If you don't need it don't take it.  \n Instead of taking something like that purely as a preventative (that you might not need anyway) I would suggest taking Tums\/Rolaids and immodium pills.  At the first sign of a grumbly stomach I took one or two rolaids.  That pretty much settled my stomach right down.  If needed, follow with immodium\/pepto.  \n Hand wipes are a wonderful thing for before\/after meals and for just general.  Many places you'll visit are extremely busy and just touching things is how you generally pick up things like colds.  Take a handful in your day pack each day and you've got them if you want them.  I wasn't even remotely religious about using them, but when I wanted one I was thrilled to have it.  Also if you're visiting in the summer it's always nice to be able to wipe off a bit if you get sweaty (always a good feeling after a long flight or train ride).\n Snack bars... definitely a bonus!  I was often on the go in China and walked constantly.  A small snack bar kept me going when I wanted to finish poking around a site before I went to find lunch\/dinner or when I got tired on the Great Wall.  A 3 minute break to munch a granola\/snack bar, have a swig of water and I was a whole new person.   Do be careful to always find a trash bin for the wrapper or keep it in your daypack until you do find a bin.  Same with water bottles. \n TP and bathrooms... just remember that China is an amazing place and it's totally worth it!   Always carry a pack of Kleenex or a bit of TP in your daypack as most bathrooms don't stock it.  They are generally 'squatty potties' but many are actually very clean.  Get in the habit of always going before you leave the hotel in the morning.  Also, don't wait until you're really in a hurry for one so that you can pick and choose a bit.  Is it the same as western standards?  Not all of them and some are honestly terrifying, but if you wanted exactly what you're used to you wouldn't be going to China.  Just keep repeating \"it's all part of the adventure\" (say it often enough and you may even start to believe it).  I promise that China is without a single doubt worth it.   \n Also, you're going with a tour group and the tour guide is going to point out clean bathrooms.  They know that's a concern for many\/most westerners and will do their best to take care of that concern.\n Definitely try to learn how to use chopsticks before you go.  You don't have to be great with them, but generally able to get food from the dish to your mouth 3 tries out of 5.  Forks aren't always available and people were very friendly when they saw me trying to use the chopsticks.  I wasn't good at it (though I got a LOT better after just a couple days), but I was making at attempt and they appreciated that.  I found it hilarious that the two little sticks were so obviously smarter than I was. \n If someone gives you a business card, take it with both hands and do NOT put it in a rear pocket (even in a wallet).  I don't know why anyone would give you a card, but just incase.  Definitely learn the words for please, thank you, yes, no, how much, etc.  You don't have to be good at them but again just the attempt goes a long way.  \n What time of year are you going?  I was there over Christmas a year ago and Beijing was very windy.  Dressing in layers is the best thing you can do no matter what time of year you go.  \n I can't think of anything else off the top of my head but I can't imagine anyone not enjoying a visit to China.  It truly was amazing. \nI forgot to add duct tape!  I always travel with a little bit of duct tape wrapped around a small chunk of cardboard (think credit card sized) and many people use a pen to wrap it around.  It's great for fixing tears or hems that you don't have time\/inclination to stitch, can be used to hold curtains shut if they don't quite meet in the middle and for 1,000 other uses including medical.\n When I start to get a blister I generally put a bandaid or a chunk of kleenex\/tp down to protect it and then put duct tape over it because a bandaid just gets rubbed off.  In China I twisted up my ankle a bit and used a duct tape brace (simple gauze or kleenex against my skin, and then wrapped a figure 8 under my foot, in front of my ankle, around my ankle, back in front of my ankle and around).  It sounds ridiculous, but it worked wonderfully!  As with any brace, remember not to make it too tight.\nNot all traveler's diarrhea should be treated with Imodium or similar anti-diarrheal. Depending on the organism causing the diarrhea, trying to stop the diarrhea can make the infection worse. \n Talk to you doctor or travel clinic about when you should or should not use an anti-diarrheal.\nJaya is correct. Not all diarrhea is treated the same except it is always important to keep well hydrated and keep up with fluid loss- not just water but any broth, clear liquids.\n Most diarrhea is self-limited meaning they usually get better without specific antibiotics.\n Pepto-bismol has been recommended by CDC to PREVENT gastroenteritis.  As anybody who has traveled and trekked will tell you, preventing diarrhea is always worthwhile.\n Liquid hand-sanitizers eg CVS\/Purell brand are ecologically better than hand wipes which add to waste\/trash.\n Have fun.\nI agree with using Purel over handiwipes but Beijing airport security  took one of ours away, held it up high for all to see, shaking her head and expressing disdain for what we had done.\nI got a slew of vaccinations before I went last fall:  TDP (it is the combined tetanus, diptheria, pertussis...you seldom get \"just\" a tetanus shot anymore), Hep A (had first for Russia, second for China), Hep B (managed to get 2 of the required 3 in before I left), did the typhoid pill series.  Your personal physician may not even stock most of those (mine didn't) so a travel clinic may be your only option.  These are not cheap either, so call your health insurance company to confirm.  Total billed for my vaccinations was over $600.  A travel clinic will also want to know your exact itinerary as they will research particular regions where you are going to see if there are any recent outbreaks they can vaccinate you against.\n But more importantly, both my personal physician and the travel clinic recommended a TB test about 3 months after I return.  As China is a \"spitting\" culture and we were walking in it and cooped up on airplanes with Chinese who may have it, they said it was good practice to get the test done at the very least, regardless of whether you get the vaccinations for anything else.  Others I traveled with were told the same.\nThat's an interesting recommendation about TB testing. \n To really know whether you have been exposed and therefore developed a positive test will require proof of a negative test before you leave. \n It gets even trickier because some positive reactors may initially be negative then become positive only after a second test called an amnestic response.  \n I would discuss it with your doctor to see if it's indicated.  There are many ramifications of taking a TB test not the least of which is what to do with the result.\nWe had the Hep A\/B, called TwinRix, series last November before we went to China. It is a series of three shots and even on the accelerated schedule it takes 5 weeks to complete. Also did the Typhoid and DPT but not the malaria as the side effects look way scarey.\nmichele, there is no vaccine for malaria.  If you are speaking of anti-malarial pills one takes, I can only assume that you read\/heard about larium (which can have bad side effects) and not about the other options (malarone, doxycycline) which have fewer side effects.  Still, if you are traveling in a high risk region, the side effects of anti-malarials are not nearly as scary as the impact of contracting malaria.  Given that only small parts of CHina are malarial risk, I'm assuming your travel med doctor did not recommend that you take anti-malarials.\nKathie,\n You are right. I am speaking of the anti-malarial pills. The reason I choose not to take the pills, even though they were recommended for the small area of the Yangtze River we visited, was because of my predisposition to nightmares and night terrors. A side effect of the pills was vivid nightmares which could continue for years. \n After consulting with the health dept, my doctor and my pharmacist they all recommended I not take the pills and I agreed. The thought of having increased nightmares was a terrifying thought. I had to weigh the pros and cons and for me it was the better choice I believe. It's hard to know what to do sometimes. Each person has to do the research and determine what is best for their situation.\nMalaria is only one of many mosquito borne illnesses, many of which have no prophylaxis. The most prudent thing to do in Asia is to do whatever is possible to avoid mosquito bites. You will still get an errant bite here and there, but most can be avoided by staying in hotels that don't have mosquitos in the rooms so you don't get bitten up while sleeping. \n Certain types of mosquitos bite in the morning and other types bite in the evening. Daytime is usually the safest for not getting bitten. Loose, gauzy clothing makes it harder for them to bite through your clothing. \n Bring repellant and use it generously.\nMichele, my point was that only one anti-malarial, larium, causes nightmare\/night terrors.  Neither malarone not doxy do.  I'm not second-guessing your choice not to take anti-malarials for this trip (and Jaya's advice to use repellent is good), but I hope you (and others) know that not all anti-malarials have serious side effects.\nThanks Kathie. Yes, Larium is what my doc prescribed for me. Good to know about the other ones though. It was December and snowing when we were in China and we were so covered up a mosquito would have a hard time finding any skin to bite anyways.\nOne of the ways to stay safe has nothing to do with vaccinations. \n It's what you put in your mouth. \n Think seriously about what you put in your mouth. \n Brushing your teeth? Use bottled water. \n Taking a shower? Don't open your mouth. \n Ordering meals? never order raw salad or peeled fruit. Even fruit with skin on can be a problem. You handle the skin to peel the fruit, then pop the peeled fruit into your mouth with the same (contaminated) fingers.\n That street food look or smell really tempting? Don't. \n Drinking from a glass? Do you know where that glass was before it reached your table? This is why, even in the States now, some Asian restaurants serve water with a straw.\n In other words, take a lot of precautions about what you put into your mouth. \n The chances of you catching something via food or drink may be minimal, but again, why take the chance? \n I'm going to tell this story again. I had a colleague with whom I travelled quite a bit in Asia. You think he would have known better, but, in Korea, where they like raw beef (sort of like carpaccio), he ate some at a banquet. Thereafter, he had severe intestinal problems for the rest of his life. Not even the medications in the US, when he came home, could help him. \n So, please, be careful what you put into your mouth. Nothing raw, untreated, or uncooked. \n Have a great trip! I hope i haven't scared you too much! \nOr just stay at home - its much safer!!!\n<<<crellston on Apr 10, 12 at 1:15pm \n Or just stay at home - its much safer!!!>>>\n Ick!  Boo!  Hiss!  \n China is safe, but do take reasonable precautions.  easytraveler mentioned using bottled water to brush your teeth...  I always tried to forget and have learned to put a wash cloth (or something) over the tap so that I stop before I just go for the water on autopilot.\nlol -the data on accidents in the home should be enough to make anyone want to go on vacation!\nThe hotels we stayed in and cruise ship supplied bottled water daily. I kept these bottles on the bathroom counter so I would always see them and not accidentally forget.\nIf you read the CDC they are recomending that adults have an up dated Polio shot.  There is an outbreak in  China.   Not a bad idea in general, as alot of our childhood inoculations are past their sell by date.\nMy husband and I have traveled to China 4 times and never had any vaccinations and\/or medical issues during or after a trip.  Common sense is the biggest factor.\n On an organized tour, you will be in mainly areas frequented by tourists.\n Go and have fun!\nOur MD said these shots\/pills are a good precaution to have in any event, no matter where you are in the world, due to possible food contamination.\nAs a physician an frequent traveler, here is my  2 cents.\n First, get whatever vaccines that you should have for your age anyway.\n Next, get the vaccines advised by the CDC for the specific cities you are visiting.  Most likely with a Tauk tour, there won't be any that you should not have had anyway. ALso, it's unlikely that they will recommend malaria meds and since they do have side effects, don't take them unnecessarily.\n Only drink bottled water or other bottled drinks, drinks made with boiled water (coffee, tea) or alcoholic beverages.\n As for food, Tauk will likely only take you to tried and true restaurants - if their clientele were getting sick all the time, they would not stay in business.  So, if your guide says it is OK, trust him\/her and have a good time enjoying local cuisine - that is one of the main reasons for traveling.  However, when wandering around on your own, I'd follow the usual advice not to eat raw vegetables or unpeeled fruit.\n The most common illness that I have seen on guided tours are colds and these sometimes lead to bronchitis or pneumonia as travelers' immune systems are stressed because of jet lag, sleep deprivation, etc.  Colds are spread by touch - so wash hands, wash hands, use hand sanitizer, etc.  If possible, don't touch the railings on busses, staircases, etc. - though do so if needed, as a fall and fracture in China may be a lot worse than a cold.\n Above all, don't let your fears get in the way of your enjoyment.\nGreat advice for you here, RockStone! Bottled water for everything is a must, as is (sadly) avoiding street food. And you just never know when or where you'll encounter a squat toilet - just think of it as the cultural difference it is.\n You asked what else to bring, and I agree with what's been listed already. In addition to toilet paper, pepto tablets, immodium and hand sanitizer, I brought an asthma inhaler - I have very mild, exercise-induced asthma here, but I was concerned about the effect of living in Beijing's air pollution for a month. \n As for hand sanitizer, I found a lavender-scented one at Whole Foods. I put the full-size bottle in my checked luggage and the tiny travel-size one in my carryon, with no problems going through airport security. I bought the lavender scent for its calming properties (not knowing if I'd need a little aromatherapy support in crowds!), but it also came in handy when I wanted relief from occasional pungent scents around me!\n China is an amazing place to experience firsthand. As 'fb' said, \"Above all, don't let your fears get in the way of your enjoyment.\" !!!\nRe: eating fruit.  I found it weird in our group, three people ate fruit off a street cart.  A very well-traveled husband and wife ate it with absolutely no issue.  A woman who was traveling out of the US for the first time became very, very ill for a few days.  As we all ate together all three daily meals other than that, the fruit was the only thing different, but how it affected one and not the other two?  Do you build an immunity with frequent travel, I wonder?\n Also, I got a measles mumps rubella shot, only because Boston (where I live\/work) was having an outbreak last year at the time and there was a period in the mid-60s to mid 70s where the vaccinations were found to have lasted as long, and that's when I got mine as a child.  Just something else to know.\nWe were told it was OK to eat fruit with hatd shell like melons. Otherwise, fruit had to be peeled.\n","72":"Experts answer common questions about vaccines for children and adults.\n 1. How Do Vaccines Work?\n When you get sick, your body creates special proteins called antibodies to fight the infection. The next time you are exposed to that same virus or bacteria, those antibodies keep you from getting sick again. Vaccines do the same thing without making you ill.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccines induce the protective immunity that is a consequence of natural infection, without having to pay the price of [becoming sick with] a natural infection,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Paul Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital of Philadelphia.\u00c2\u00a0\nScientists create vaccines by disabling a virus or bacteria so that it is not able to cause disease but still can prod your body to make antibodies to it. Those antibodies will bind to infections in the future and keep them from making you sick. Getting a vaccine is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153like having a protective bubble that keeps viruses and bacteria from attacking your body,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Offit said.\nRelated: How to Feel Better Every Day\n2. Have Vaccines Eradicated Common Diseases?\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccines are one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of all time, but not all diseases are completely gone, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why it remains critical for parents to vaccinate their children and themselves,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Melissa Stockwell, assistant professor of pediatrics and population and family health at Columbia University in Manhattan.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe only disease that vaccines have successfully eradicated (meaning it will never reoccur) is smallpox. There are others that might be eradicated if vaccination rates become high enough, including polio, measles, rubella (German measles), and chicken pox (varicella). Of those, the only disease close to eradication is polio. For other diseases, such as tetanus, eradication is not possible, because the bacterium that causes it lives in the soil and can never be eliminated.\nBut vaccines have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dramatically reduced the amount of suffering and hospitalization or death caused by disease,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Offit said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For diseases like rotaviruses, influenza, chicken pox, and whooping cough, vaccines have turned them into diseases that are mild or without symptoms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nBefore there was a vaccine for it, there were 8,000 deaths a year in the United States from whooping cough (also known as pertussis); now there are around 50. Before a vaccine was invented for measles, there were 4 million cases in the U.S. and between 500 and 1,000 deaths annually; in 2011, there were 122 cases and no deaths. Polio used to kill 1,500 people a year; now polio is no longer a concern in the United States.\n3. How Long Do Vaccines Last?\n Some vaccines, such as the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and poliovirus vaccines, offer lifelong protection. Others, including influenza and meningococcal vaccines, as well as vaccines containing pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus, require boosters in the teen and adult years.\nRelated: The 8 Germiest Items in Your Home\n4. Do Vaccines Cause Side Effects?\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All vaccines can cause mild side effects,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Offit said.\u00c2\u00a0\nThose side infects can include pain and tenderness at the site of an injection, a low-grade fever, and irritability. The chicken pox and measles vaccines sometimes provoke a mild rash that looks like a few blisters or spots. In addition, vaccines can sometimes cause a high fever in children, which can lead to a febrile seizure (this type of fever-caused seizure is harmless, but it can be very scary for parents).\u00c2\u00a0\nOther side effects are much more rare, though they can happen: The oral polio vaccine that used to be given in the United States did, in a few instances, actually cause polio, but the shot that is used today does not. Measles can cause a lowering of a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s platelet count, but it does not last or cause permanent problems, says Offit.\n5. Is There Evidence of a Connection Between Vaccines and Autism?\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dozens of studies have been done and none have shown a connection between vaccines and autism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Allison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation.\nA possible connection was first raised by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a British doctor who published a study in 1998 of 12 children in Britain who were diagnosed with autism within a month of receiving the MMR vaccine.\nWakefield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paper \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has since been withdrawn by the scientific journal that published it. It was declared to be fraudulent, and the primary author was stripped of his medical license,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Singer.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Studies have been conducted all around the world to try to replicate Wakefield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Amy Pisani, executive director of Every Child by Two, an organization that raises awareness about the importance of timely immunizations, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never been a single study connecting vaccines and autism. Of all the things we know about autism, we know vaccines do not cause it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nRelated: How to Keep Things in Moderation\n6. What Is Thimerosal and Is It Dangerous?\n The mercury-containing preservative thimerosal, which keeps vaccines sterile, is an ingredient in vaccines that are used to inoculate more than one person at a time (such as the flu vaccine). Mercury is a heavy metal that can be damaging in high doses, which is why concerns were raised about a possible connection between vaccines containing thimerosal and autism.\u00c2\u00a0\nSince the late \u00e2\u20ac\u212290s, seven large studies have been done in the U.S., Canada, and Europe comparing children in Europe (where thimerosal was banned in 1991) and the United States (where it remained in most vaccines until 1999). The result?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You were not at greater risk for autism if you got a vaccine with thimerosal than if you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Offit said.\u00c2\u00a0\nThese days, thimerosal is in very few vaccines in the U.S. and, Offit said, children are exposed to much higher levels of mercury from the environment alone (for instance, breast-fed babies are exposed to more mercury from breast milk than were children who received vaccines before thimerosal was removed in 1999, Offit said).\u00c2\u00a0\nIn addition, the type of mercury used in vaccines (ethylmercury) is actually eliminated from your body much faster than the type found in the environment (methylmercury). Still, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re concerned about thimerosal, it is possible to ask your pediatrician for thimerosal-free vaccines.\n7. Why Does My Baby Have to Get So Many Vaccines So Early in Her Life?\n The current vaccination schedule that your doctor most likely adheres to is based on recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The first year of life is when the majority of vaccines are given,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dr. Larry Pickering, senior advisor to the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said.\u00c2\u00a0\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for two reasons: One, vaccines are timed to protect children at the ages when they are most likely to be exposed to certain illnesses or are at greatest risk of dying from them. And the schedule is based on research conducted on the safety of vaccines when given in conjunction with other vaccines.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccines are thoroughly evaluated and then licensed for the ages at which they have been studied,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pickering said.\n8. Do I Need to Worry About \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccine Overload\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd?\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccine overload\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is the idea that when children are given multiple vaccines at once or close together (as they are when they are babies), their immune systems can be either harmed by the vaccines or will be unable to respond properly to them. Experts say there is no scientific evidence to support the idea.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn fact, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153infants in their everyday life come in contact with far more antigens [the components of vaccines and diseases] that their body has to fight than are in vaccines,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stockwell said.\u00c2\u00a0\nOffit likes to point out that, because the technology used to make modern vaccines has so vastly improved, the first smallpox vaccine given to children at the turn of the century had more immunological components than all of the vaccines together that are given to children before the age of 14 today.\n9. Are There Alternative or Selective Vaccine Schedules I Can Follow?\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are alternative schedules proposed by some people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pickering said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but they are not evidence-based. If you spread vaccines out, children are susceptible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0\nIf the idea of several shots at once makes parents nervous, Pickering said there is some wiggle room in a few vaccines, such as polio and hepatitis B (the third dose can be given from 6 months through 18 months of age) and the chickenpox vaccine. But studies have demonstrated that the stress response babies show after one shot does not increase when they are given more shots in the same visit.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153One vaccine produces the maximum amount of stress,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Offit said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and bringing children back to the doctor frequently only increases their stress and their needle phobia.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0\nSaid Stockwell, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problem is that there is no known benefit of delaying vaccines, and we do know that you are putting your child at risk for a particular disease by delaying vaccination.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0\nPlus, a study released in June 2012 in the journal Pediatrics found that when parents follow a delayed vaccination schedule their children ultimately end up getting fewer vaccinations.\n10. Have There Been Resurgences in Some Diseases Because People Are Opting Not to Vaccinate?\n In the past six years there have been outbreaks in the United States of mumps, measles, and pertussis (whooping cough).\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153When vaccine rates erode, the diseases that come back first are the most contagious,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Offit said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Measles, mumps, and whooping cough all fall into that category.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0\nIn 2010, California experienced the biggest whooping cough outbreak since 1947 with 10,000 cases and 10 deaths. These outbreaks have all been tied to declining rates of vaccinations, which may have to do with parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lingering fears of a link between vaccines and autism.\u00c2\u00a0\nBut, said Singer, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153when parents delay or withhold vaccines, they are doing nothing to decrease the chance that their child will be diagnosed with autism, but they are absolutely increasing the chance that their babies could contract diseases that could kill them. Children are now dying from diseases for which we have vaccines because parents have bad information, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great tragedy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAnother significant cause of the whooping cough outbreak is that the immunity from the pertussis vaccine adults received when they were children wanes. In fact, in April 2012, a pertussis epidemic was declared in Washington State, with the highest number of cases of pertussisis reported in any year since 1942, affecting not just infants under the age of 1 but adolescents and adults as well. Experts advise that all adults and adolescents should receive the Tdap vaccine, which protects against pertussis, along with tetanus and diphtheria.\n11. Do All States Require That Children Be Vaccinated Before Entering School?\n Most of the states have some requirements, according to Pickering. Parents can find out what their state necessitates through the Immunization Action Coalition, a resource for immunization information; by checking their state health department website; or by asking their pediatrician. \u00c2\u00a0\nMany states also allow for exceptions to those requirements based on medical, religious, or philosophical grounds. All 50 states exempt children who medically cannot receive a vaccine (because they are allergic to one of the components, for example). Forty-eight states will allow parents to forgo vaccines for religious reasons, and 20 states have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153philosophical or personal belief\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd laws that enable parents to choose not to vaccinate.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn many cases, parents need only sign a form to take advantage of the exemptions, but some states are trying to strengthen the requirements (for instance, calling for parents to attend some sort of vaccination education program before being able to exempt their children from immunization).\n12. If Most Children Receive Vaccinations, Do I Need to Vaccinate My Child?\n It is technically possible \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to vaccinate a high enough proportion of the population without vaccinating the entire population and [still] eliminate diseases,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Offit said.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe concept is called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because the idea is that you can live safely within the herd if enough of the herd is vaccinated.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problem,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stockwell said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is that coverage has to be really high for herd immunity to work, and we know that coverage is not high enough, especially in this age of global travel and as vaccination rates drop. Many of these diseases are present in the community, and the best way to protect your child is to have him or her vaccinated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0\nOffit also points out that some 500,000 people nationwide cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons and those people, who may have compromised immune systems, depend on high vaccination rates among the population of people who can safely be vaccinated.\n13. Should a Child With a Cold Receive a Scheduled Vaccination?\n Yes, it is fine for a child with a mild illness\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsuch as an upper respiratory tract infection, a low-grade fever, or diarrhea\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto receive a vaccination. Studies have shown that they are not at increased risk for safety issues or side effects, Offit said. But every physician will have his or her own benchmark for when to vaccinate. Many will opt to vaccinate so that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss the opportunity, but some will defer if the child has a fever.\n14. Do Teenagers and Adults Need to Be Immunized?\n Adolescents should receive the meningococcal, influenza, and whooping cough (Tdap) vaccines, as well as a series of three shots to protect against the human papilloma virus (HPV), which has been linked to multiple types of cancers, Pickering said.\u00c2\u00a0\nAdults should make sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve received the Tdap vaccine, followed every 10 years with a tetanus\/diphtheria (Td) booster and the varicella vaccine if they never had chicken pox as a child or herpes zoster infection or have not ever received two doses of a varicella-containing vaccine. They should also review their history of MMR vaccine with their physician to see if they need a booster.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe CDC also recommends that all people 6 months of age and older receive a yearly flu vaccine, that adults 60 years of age and older get a shingles vaccine, and that females through the age of 26 and males through the age of 21 receive the three doses of HPV vaccine, should they not have been vaccinated in adolescence. The CDC has smart immunization scheduler tools to help you determine if everyone in your family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dadults, younger children, and older children\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis up to date.\n15. Do Doctors Recommend That Pregnant Women Get Vaccines?\n Yes, there are several vaccines that are recommended for pregnant women. Pertussis vaccine given as Tdap should be administered at more than 20 weeks gestation or immediately after delivery (and followed with a Td booster every 10 years), Pickering said. Pertussis can be fatal in infants and keeping moms healthy is one way to protect babies. Pregnant women themselves are particularly vulnerable to the flu, which can be fatal to them; receiving the annual flu shot is crucial during pregnancy.\nWomen who plan to become pregnant should also be vaccinated for measles, mumps, and rubella before pregnancy if they have never been inoculated, but not during pregnancy, since the MMR vaccine is a live viral vaccine.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If a pregnant woman is infected with rubella, she has an 85 percent chance of delivering a child with severe birth defects,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdOffit said. (Though use of the rubella vaccine in pregnancy itself has never been shown to cause birth defects, there is a theoretical risk that it could, given the documented affects of rubella infection.)\u00c2\u00a0\nIn addition, pregnant women should not receive other live viral vaccines, such as the varicella vaccine or the live attenuated influenza vaccine.\n","73":"De GGD richt zich op alle inwoners van Amsterdam,\u00ad Aalsmeer, Amstelveen, Diemen, Ouder-Amstel en Uithoorn.\nTravelling and vaccinations\n30 maart 2016\nThe Travellers' advice and vaccination office, part of the\u00c2\u00a0public health service of Amsterdam (GGD), administers vaccinations and provides travellers with fitting recommendations\u00c2\u00a0for all their travels to countries in Africa, South and Central America, Asia and the former Eastern Bloc countries.\nMind: recommendations are only given strictly in person and will absolutely not be provided by means of telephone or e-mail.\nThis is to prevent any misunderstandings that might occur.\n","74":"Sometimes it looks like one thing causes another. Every time you eat ice cream, your nose hurts. Every time you turn on the sink, your pipes clank. Or in this case, HPV vaccines seem to coincide with strange side effects. \nThat does NOT mean the existence of cause and effect. It means you have a hypothesis (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think x causes y\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), which you need to test in order to rule out all of the other possible factors. But sometimes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to convince people that their hypothesis is wrong... especially if scientists do something to validate it.\nSome scientists think that a paper published in the November 11 issue of the journal Scientific Reports did exactly that\u00e2\u20ac\u201dvalidate the idea that HPV vaccines can harm us, without running experiments that are actually relevant to what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in the human body. The researchers behind the study in question administered a dose of the HPV vaccine a thousand times higher than the appropriate dose, along with a special toxin so the vaccine would penetrate the blood-brain barrier more easily, and observed brain damage in the mice.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Basically, this is an utterly useless paper, a waste of precious animals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd blogged David Gorski, a surgical oncologist at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit, Michigan, as reported by Science magazine. The man has a point. When you last went in for a vaccine, did the doctor put you on an IV and then feed you poison? \nThe reason scientists are angry about this study goes beyond wasted research dollars. Prior to its publication, recipients of the HPV vaccine reported strange side effects, from fatigue  to walking difficulties. Media outlets picked up the reports, spawning anti-vaccination movements. Later studies found that the symptoms were equally likely whether patients had been vaccinated or not. Unfortunately, though the vaccine appears to have cut HPV rates, vaccination rates have been falling in Ireland, Denmark and Japan, Science reports.\nThe scientists behind the mouse study have responded to the blowback, saying this was a first test similar to other types of studies done in mice. But when the public gets concerned that two things correlate, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to the scientists to develop non-biased, realistic experiments that either prove or disprove cause-and-effect.  Shoddy or unrealistic experimental design can bring far more hurt than harm. In the case of the HPV vaccine, that harm is potentially hundreds of thousands of cases of cervical cancer.\n","75":"Within the\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccine firestorm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that has taken centrestage of late, voracious reporters have vehemently sought to demonise the filmmakers that dare to question the safety of vaccines. These filmmakers (dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153babykillers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frauds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the mainstream media), are people who have put their careers and lives on the line to share the truth with the world\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand they are finally making headway.\nDespite all efforts to censor and divert attention from the true themes within the film, Vaxxed hit theatres this weekend in New York; with sold out screenings\u00c2\u00a0illustrating the public will NOT be told what to think.

I am the producer of the film Vaxxed: From Cover-Up To Catastrophe. From the moment I\u00c2\u00a0started working on this movie people have asked why I would choose to leave my career as a respected producer on the medical talk show, The Doctors, to make a movie with Dr. Andrew Wakefield, arguably the most controversial figure in modern medicine. The answer is I had no choice.\nUpon meeting Andrew (who I will refer to as Andy) I was haunted by all of the headlines that preceded him, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Baby Killer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Father of the anti-vax movement,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fraudulent Doctor who created a fake paper linking vaccines to autism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The doctor who performed unnecessary experiments on innocent children,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the list went on and on. But when Andy showed me the documentary film he was making about Dr. William Thompson, the CDC whistleblower, I was blown away. The evidence was undeniable. The CDC had lied to the world. It was the most important story of my life. As an Emmy Award-winning medical producer I knew I had the skill to help Andy deliver a documentary about complicated science, but before I could move forward I had to investigate Andy himself.\nAs soon as I started looking into the facts behind the case against Andy I realized that I had been repeating a lot of bumper sticker slogans about his story that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually true. To begin with I was shocked to discover that Andy never came out against vaccines. WHAT?! What Andy had recommended was that parents vaccinate their children with the single Measles, single Mumps, and single Rubella vaccines instead of the triple MMR vaccine, which many parents were blaming for their child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regression into autism. Seems reasonable enough. More alarming was the realization that the Lancet paper in question clearly states that it does not prove a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Though the majority of parents in the study and tens of thousands world wide have made this claim, the paper admitted that more studies needed to be done before coming to a definitive conclusion.\nI was surprised to find that the allegations against Andy were not initiated by a medical investigator or scientific institution, but by a freelance journalist named Brian Deer who wrote a Sunday Times article in the U.K. that was as scientifically accurate as a gossip column. The General Medical Council in the U.K. then used Brian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imaginative retelling of the story behind the Lancet paper as grounds for a medical trial that ultimately stripped Andy of his medical license.\nI had always heard the Lancet paper described as Andrew Wakefield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fraud, but upon actually reading it the first thing one discovers is that there were twelve other co-authors on the paper. The claim that Andy used fake data to create a fraudulent paper is absurd when you realize that among his co-authors were top scientists in their fields who were responsible for performing the tests, outputting the data, and ultimately verifying that it was correctly represented in the paper before signing their names to it. If there was fraud all thirteen authors were implicated. So why is Andy the only one of the 13 co-authors currently barred from practicing medicine in the U.K.? Maybe because he was the only doctor brave enough to ignore pressure from the vaccine manufacturers and the U.K. Ministry of Health to begin larger, more in depth studies investigating the hypothesis that the MMR was causing autism in our children; studies that he never got to finish.\nThere is also the assertion that the Lancet study had been paid for by a biased outside source, which is easily refuted by following the paper trail that shows all financial contributions for the study were accepted by the Royal Free Hospital after the study had been completed.\nLastly the most disturbing accusation for me was the claim that Andy performed unnecessary procedures on innocent (mentally disabled) children. That sounds horrible until you discover that the parents had entered their children into the study because they were suffering from agonizing gastrointestinal pain and bowel issues in addition to their autism. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unnecessary procedures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd refers to the colonoscopies and intestinal biopsies that were performed by Andy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colleagues. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how a gastroenterologist is supposed to investigate possible intestinal disease without performing these standard tests, but then again, I am not a doctor. And neither is the journalist who concocted this unfortunate obstruction of medical inquiry.\nHistory has shown us time and time again that people like Galileo, who break from the scientific consensus to reveal discoveries like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the earth is not the center of the universe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are often persecuted. I suppose it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of our great human flaws. Both of these men were essentially tried for heresy. The difference is that the imprisonment of Galileo just meant there would be a delay in the advancement of modern astronomy and physics. In Andy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case we may be responsible for a civilization-ending epidemic of autism that has skyrocketed from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 45 children in less than forty years and is on a crash course for 1 in 2 by 2032. And still the CDC attempts to set our minds at ease with their official statement \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do not know what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s causing autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIn the Unites States of America we can never allow ourselves to believe that there is a case so sound that we avoid listening to a new witness or shirk our responsibility to investigate new forensic evidence. In the case of the possible link between vaccines and autism we have a new witness in the courageous CDC whistleblower, Dr. William Thompson, and we have new forensic evidence in the documents and data that he has provided us, much of which he claims was destroyed by the CDC.\nUltimately a documentary is not a court of law. It cannot prosecute a case. As journalists and filmmakers we can only reveal information as it is discovered and ask the questions we believe the citizens of the world should be asking. Much of the mainstream media have come out against this film warning people not to see it because it asks uncomfortable questions about the safety of the MMR vaccine. If we cannot ask important questions about the safety of a vaccine then I fear for more than the health of our children, I fear for the health of our democracy.\nWe should not allow anyone to dictate what we say, what we do, and what we see. You still have the power to make up your own mind. We have made a very important film. It shines a spotlight on damning evidence that the pharmaceutical industry and the CDC do not want you to see. That is probably because they know if you do see it you will find yourself in the same predicament as me for as Einstein said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those who have the privilege to know have the duty to act.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nSincerely,\nDel Bigtree \u00e2\u20ac\u201c producer of Vaxxed: From Cover-Up To Catastrophe\nTo learn more about Dr. Andrew Wakefield, please listen to this interview.\nThe controversial doc\u00c2\u00a0 Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe, about the CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cover-up of data in a 2004 study that links MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) vaccines to autism, will open your eyes to the corruption of a government agency whose job is to protect public welfare. Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director, combines fair and balanced interviews with sources ranging from parents of autistic children who were harmed by MMR vaccines to politicians, doctors and a former pharmaceutical rep along with archival footage of congressional audio recordings of Dr. William Thompson, CDC whistleblower who called Dr. Brian Hooker, a biologist, to confess that the CDC had covered-up and even manipulated crucial data in the 2004 study.\u00c2\u00a0Vaxxed\u00c2\u00a0does bring up the fact that Dr. Wakefield was accused of fraud in his 1998 report on MMR vaccines and autism, but he was\u00c2\u00a0falsely\u00c2\u00a0accused.\nUnless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re made out of stone, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find yourself deeply moved by the interviews with the parents of children who have been injured by MMR vaccines and show clear signs of autism. The facts presented will enrage you because they show how the CDC knew that MMR vaccines are linked to autism, but did everything in their power to supress that link. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll learn that, according to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, pharmaceutical companies cannot be held liable for causing harm to consumers injured by MMR vaccines (in other words: you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sue them), and that when it comes to scientific testing, MMR vaccines aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tested as rigorously and thoroughly as pharmaceutical drugs. There are no long-term studies that have tested MMR vaccines nor are there any studies that test non-vaccinated children against vaccinated children.\u00c2\u00a0Vaxxed\u00c2\u00a0shows you in an easy-to-understand way precisely how the CDC covered-up and manipulated the data from the 2004 study, and what makes that data so crucial for the sake of public welfare to begin with. Even more enraging are the revolving doors between government and Big Pharma: Dr. Julie Louise Gerberding, the former director of the CDC during that study, now works for the pharmaceutical company Merck as President of Merck Vaccines. Merck just so happens to have an exclusive license to manufacture MMR vaccines. Make of that what you will. Not surprisingly, Dr. Gerberding declined to be interviewed. Her silence speaks louder than words, though.\nBig Pharma seems like a pimp while government agencies such as the CDC and even the mainstream media are essentially Big Pharma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unctuous prostitutes. Learning about the CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conscious decision to undermine public welfare reminds me of what Hannah Arendt wrote about the banality of evil. Many members of the CDC are merely following orders and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even consider the option of subversively criticizing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153party line\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like Dr. Thompson dared to do so bravely.\nHow is the CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cover-up not a crime against humanity? If there were any justice in this world, they would be tried in the Hague. If there were indeed a Nuremberg-like trial for the CDC, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doubtful that the excuse \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was just following orders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would be accepted. Better yet, there should be mandatory mental health assessments for all government agencies as well as politicans. Just imagine if Donald Trump were to undergo a mental health assessment! I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised at all if Narcissistic Personality Disorder were a common mental illness found in our government.\nRegardless of where you stand on the issue of vaccines,\u00c2\u00a0Vaxxed\u00c2\u00a0will ultimately change the way you look at vaccines and the CDC as long as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a critical thinker who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open to new information and not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good German.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd To be fair, though, the doc doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t highlight the difference between two kinds of vaccines: vaccines that contain adjuvants and thimerosal, a preservative that contains mercury, and live, attenuated vaccines that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any adjuvants and preservatives, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a minor, forgivable issue that can be solved once you do more research and ask questions after watching the film.\nPrepare to be concurrently enlightened, alarmed and enraged. Instead of seeing vapid junk like\u00c2\u00a0Batman v. Superman\u00c2\u00a0(which is part of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bread and circuses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), see this important expos\u00c3\u00a9 and then decide for yourself whether or not it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth the risk for you and your children to be injected with an MMR vaccine. Cinema Libre Studio opens\u00c2\u00a0Vaxxed\u00c2\u00a0at the Angelika Film Centre. \u00c2\u00a0The NYC Movie Guru\nI cannot tell you how happy I am that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve created this film.  I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to see it.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been on this road for a very long time.\nI did a lot of research 21 years ago before my daughter was born and decided not to vaccinate her as an infant.  Even though it has been a sometimes harrowing journey, I know it was the best decision I have ever made.  \nDuring her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well Baby\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd exams and then later annual exams, the doctors harassed me and accused me of taking my daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life into my hands.  I saw it the other way around. I never was able to leave the office without someone giving me a look or making a comment.\nI had a lot of support from my local homeopathic store, plus I was lucky enough to meet a scientist from Australia who had studied vaccines and their connection to both SIDS and Autism.  I met a woman who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s child died after getting her vaccines. So sad!\nAnyway, I know your film will do a lot of good, and most likely save some lives, literally!\n","76":"The filmmaking team behind the documentary Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe insists that their movie isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anti-vaccination, defending their project after it was pulled from the upcoming Tribeca Film Festival.\nThere was a huge backlash from the public, prompting\u00c2\u00a0festival organizers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including Tribeca film festival co-founder Robert De Niro \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to pull it from its movie lineup.\nREAD MORE: Bestiality and human-cow hybrids: The original anti-vax movement \nDe Niro, who has a child with autism, said he had hoped to provide an opportunity for conversation around an issue \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that is deeply personal to me and my family.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHowever, he said after he and Tribeca organizers reviewed it, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do not believe it contributes to or furthers the discussion I had hoped for.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said members of the scientific community also had reviewed it with him.\nIn response to its abrupt removal from the festival, Vaxxed director Dr. Andrew Wakefield, along with producers Del Bigtree and Polly Tommey and distributor Phillipe Diaz, held a press conference in Studio City, Calif. on Wednesday to address their film and its subject matter.\nREAD MORE: How fading dread of deadly diseases could let them stage a comeback \nDespite a trailer that seems very anti-vaccination, Wakefield and his colleagues insist it is not, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the media\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence that got the movie yanked from the festival.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am the one who suggested we bring it to Tribeca, which I now feel very bad about,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Diaz. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The New Yorker is comparing the filmmakers at this table to Leni Riefenstahl,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, referencing a Nazi film propagandist. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You think, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAre they smoking too much?'\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nBigtree, who has some experience producing medical-themed TV shows, added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not an anti-vaccine movie.

While the corporate media foams violently at the mouth over a few children,\u00c2\u00a0some vaccinated, who allegedly contracted measles at Disneyland because not everyone chooses to vaccinate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d one hate-filled report from a major news outlet has actually called for parents who oppose vaccinations to be jailed \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the level-headed, rational segments of society will recall that many earlier measles outbreaks occurred among fully vaccinated groups of people, debunking the official myth that vaccines provide protection against disease.\nIn 1987, for example, a study published in the\u00c2\u00a0New England Journal of Medicine\u00c2\u00a0(NEJM) documented a measles outbreak that occurred in Corpus Christi, Texas, in the spring of 1985. Fourteen adolescent-age students,\u00c2\u00a0all of whom had been vaccinated for measles, contracted the disease despite having been injected with the MMR vaccine. Researchers noted that more than 99 percent of students at the school \u00e2\u20ac\u201d basically all of them \u00e2\u20ac\u201d had also been vaccinated, with more than 95 percent of them showing detectable antibodies to measles.\nThis highly revealing study completely contradicts the official narrative being propagated today that unvaccinated individuals are responsible for disease outbreaks like the one that reportedly began at Disneyland. None of the students in Texas who contracted the\u00c2\u00a0measles\u00c2\u00a0in 1985 were unvaccinated, and virtually none of their peers were unvaccinated. Consequently, so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which would have been activated based on what health authorities claim as indisputable immunological fact, was also shown to be an unsubstantiated myth, further vindicating the unvaccinated as a possible cause of this particular outbreak.\nSo what\u00c2\u00a0did\u00c2\u00a0cause 14 fully vaccinated student to catch measles? A failure of the\u00c2\u00a0MMR vaccine, of course, which you will never hear about from the prostitute press. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no other valid explanation for why a fully vaccinated group of children, who were surrounded by an almost fully vaccinated group of peers, contracted a disease for which they should have been immune, according to the official story. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no blaming the one or two students who weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinated for this\u00c2\u00a0outbreak\u00c2\u00a0because:\n1) not a single unvaccinated student contracted the measles; and\n 2) herd immunity would have been activated regardless, supposedly protecting everyone.\nCDC data published after 1985 outbreak reveals exceptional failure of MMR vaccine\nAdditionally, those who\u00c2\u00a0were\u00c2\u00a0vaccinated should have been protected by the vaccine either way \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that is, if vaccines really work as claimed. They obviously don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, which is further evidenced by data later published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in its\u00c2\u00a0Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\u00c2\u00a0(MMWR).\nIn a 1988 issue of the report, the CDC published data on measles which documented 3,655 cases of measles in 1987, the previous year. Guess how many of these cases were in vaccinated individuals? 1,903, or roughly 52 percent \u00e2\u20ac\u201d more than half! So much for the effectiveness of that MMR\u00c2\u00a0vaccine\u00c2\u00a0that health authorities want you and your family to rush out and get immediately.\nMMR is the same vaccine, of course, that was exposed by the CDC whistleblower as causing autism, particularly in young African American boys. And because MMR contains attenuated (weakened) live measles virus, it can also shed from vaccinated individuals to others, which may have been behind past measles outbreaks.\nThere are number of possible factors here that the media is ignoring in its vicious witch hunt to demonize all those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-vaxxers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd out there who have legitimate concerns about the safety and effectiveness of this controversial vaccine. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let them bully you \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it is ultimately your decision to decide what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best for your children, even if it means foregoing what the establishment claims is the solution.\nSources for this article include:\nDisclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

But all this does is to increase the public's suspicion of the real agenda behind their ostensibly charitable plea to save the poor and the needy from the hell of disease, instead of focusing on improving their most basic living conditions, nutrition, sanitation, refrigeration, etc., and making inroads to reduce the geopolitical violence that is ruining the lives of hundreds of millions.\nMeasles is a real disease with real adverse health effects, some of which can be life threatening in the already immunocompromised (vaccination representing a major cause of TH1\/TH2\u00c2\u00a0imbalances). But it is our immune status, as with all infectious diseases, that determines susceptibility and whether or not a disease will be mild or lethal. You can't vaccinate away conditions that lead to compromised immunity, nor can you 'immunize' folks -- especially parents -- against the desire to pursue the truth about vaccines.

According to the prevailing propaganda it is fringe religious communities, visitors from countries where measles is common, and vaccine objectors within the United States, that are responsible for the failure of the measles vaccine to confer lasting immunity.\nLooking at the rising tide of vaccine resistant infectious outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad --\u00c2\u00a0chickenpox, shingles,\u00c2\u00a0mumps,\u00c2\u00a0whooping cough (pertussis), influenza, HPV (Gardasil), hepatitis B, to name but a few --\u00c2\u00a0through the lens of the peer-reviewed and published literature on the topic, it is clear that the vaccines and not those who refuse to subject themselves to them are at the root of the problem. And nowhere is this more clearly evident than in the measles vaccine.\nHow do we know this?\nJust a few months ago, a study published in PLoS titled, \"Difficulties in eliminating measles and controlling rubella and mumps: a cross-sectional study of a first measles and rubella vaccination and a second measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination,\" brought to light the glaring ineffectiveness of two measles vaccines (measles\u00e2\u20ac\u201crubella (MR) or measles\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmumps\u00e2\u20ac\u201crubella\u00c2\u00a0(MMR) ) in fulfilling their widely claimed promise of preventing outbreaks in highly vaccine compliant populations. We dove deeply into the implications of this study in our article titled, \"Why Is China Having Measles Outbreaks When 99% Are Vaccinated?\"\nAlso, as we have explored in a previous article, \"Measles: A Rash of Misinformation,\" the measles vaccine is not nearly as safe and effective as is widely believed. Measles outbreaks have consistently occurred in highly immunization compliant populations. Here are just a few examples reported in the medical literature:\n1985, Texas, USA: According to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1987, \"An outbreak of measles occurred among adolescents in Corpus Christi, Texas, in the spring of 1985, even though vaccination requirements for school attendance had been thoroughly enforced.\" They concluded: \"We conclude that outbreaks of measles can occur in secondary schools, even when more than 99 percent of the students have been vaccinated and more than 95 percent are immune.\"1\n","80":"This article is copyrighted by GreenMedInfo LLC, 2014\nA new study finds highly malignant mumps infections in those successfully vaccinated against the virus... \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nA provocative new study titled, \"Epidemic of complicated mumps in previously vaccinated young adults in the South-West of France,\" reveals that the MMR vaccine, despite generating high rates of presumably protective IgG antibodies against mumps, does not always translate into real-world immunity against infection as we have repeatedly\u00c2\u00a0been\u00c2\u00a0told. To the contrary, the study details cases where, despite the detection of high levels of antibodies against the mumps virus, patients contracted a malignant form of mumps that only rarely follows from natural, community acquired infection.\nWhile\u00c2\u00a0counter-intuitive to those who uncritically accept the official marketing copy of the vaccine industry and their cheerleaders within government and the mainstream media,\u00c2\u00a0the research community and general public is beginning to appreciate how prevalent and well-documented vaccine failure really is, especially in the case of measles, hepatitis B, chickenpox, pertussis\u00c2\u00a0(whooping cough), HIV, polio, HPV,\u00c2\u00a0and influenza vaccines\u00c2\u00a0that do not work as advertised.\nWe live in a time when many medical interventions are decided not by the weight of the evidence itself, but by 'science by proclamation,' i.e. the public, and the regulatory agencies legally responsible for protecting them, simply accept pleas to authority or vague references to 'the Science,' without any acknowledgement\u00c2\u00a0of the reality of how vaccine research is manipulated or simply selectively published to serve economic and socio-political agendas. For example, of the billions of dollars (much of which is funded by you, the taxpayer) funneled into proving vaccines safe and effective thus far, not a single published study exists to date that compares vaccinated subjects to non-vaccinated ones. The obvious reason is that if the results of such a study demonstrated better health or immunity in the non-vaccinated group (as many suspect), the entire house of cards supporting our present-day, globally coordinated pro-vaccine agenda would fall to pieces.\nLacking such a study, we can deduce through naturalistic data -- e.g. the fact that the Amish, who do not vaccinate, have exceptionally low rates of autism -- evolutionary models of natural immunity, or global epidemiological analyses -- e.g.\u00c2\u00a0the U.S. has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the developed world at the same time that it gives its infants the most vaccines --\u00c2\u00a0that our vaccine-centric 'preventive' medical model has resulted in untold harm to our infants and children.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you read the primary literature on vaccines you will find that some of the fundamental tenets of classical immunology and vaccinology are being called into question, such as the belief that surrogate determinants of vaccine-induced protection against infection equate to real world immunity.\u00c2\u00a0For instance, a groundbreaking new study calls into question the FDA\/CDC's primary justification for approving vaccines based on their ability to raise antibody titers, finding that\u00c2\u00a0no antibodies are required for immunity against some viruses.\u00c2\u00a0This devastating blow, receiving little to no mainstream media coverage, revealed that surrogate markers of vaccine effectiveness -- like vaccine-induced elevation of antibody titers -- may be useless, despite the key fact that they are often used to accelerate the vaccine approval process in lieu of well designed human clinical trials required to determine safety and actual effectiveness.\nCase Study: Fully 'Immunized' Patients Can Contract Malignant Mumps \nThe featured study in this article was conducted by a team of French researchers, who discovered cases of complicated mumps in previously vaccinated young adults. Complicated mumps refers to serious bodily damage caused by mumps infections. Naturally occurring mumps, on the other hand, is not known to cause permanent damage to those who are infected through community exposure; to the contrary, it confers much longer protection. The researchers affirm the normally benign trajectory of mumps infections, stating: \"Mumps is a usually benign pediatric viral disease caused by a rubulavirus, RNA virus of the paramyxoviridae family.\"\nThe report was based on a retrospective analysis of 7 cases of complicated mumps managed during 1 year at the Bordeaux University Hospital, France. The diagnosis was suggested by the clinical presentation and confirmed using specific \"Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction,\" [RT-PCR].\nThe results of their investigation was reported as follows:\nThe emboldened statement above is instructive. Whereas the vaccine industry and the FDA determines so-called 'vaccine efficacy' by proxy to determine effectiveness, i.e. either through increased antibody titer generation or through the 'gold standard' of the Plaque reduction neutralization test, this does not always translate into actually protecting the vaccinated individual from infection. In other words, this study reveals that real world immunity against the target pathogen is not guaranteed by these surrogate markers.\nTo this point, the researchers acknowledge in their concluding remarks:\nIf this is true, the question should be: is it worth administering a one-size-fits-all MMR vaccine to every child, regardless of their bio-individuality and gene- and epigenetically-mediated susceptibilities to being harmed by them? This question becomes all the more salient when we consider that the MMR vaccine has been linked to the pathogenesis of autism, with a top CDC vaccine researcher William Thompson\u00c2\u00a0publicly confessing in an August 27th\u00c2\u00a0release by his legal team that the CDC covered up data showing that the\u00c2\u00a0MMR contributes to autism in African-American male children. \u00c2\u00a0\nClearly the MMR vaccine's utility depends only on whether its benefits in protecting against measles, mumps and rubella outweigh its harms. The possibility that it has contributed to the explosion of autism spectrum disorders in the past few decades is reason enough to give pause and re-evaluate its place in the vaccine schedule, especially considering it has been linked in the biomedical literature to\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 30 other serious adverse health effects .\u00c2\u00a0\nIt would be one thing if it actually worked as unilaterally presented to the public, but\u00c2\u00a0a recent Chinese study that found measles outbreaks were occurring in populations with 99% MMR vaccine immunization compliance.\u00c2\u00a0 Research like this shows that the risk side of the equation may far outstrip its purported benefit to the hundreds of millions of children worldwide who are either coerced (in countries that still have mainly unexercised exemptions) or mandated into taking them.\u00c2\u00a0\nUltimately, it is a parent's right and responsibility to decide whether their children should participate in the CDC's immunization schedule, which involves 49 doses of 16 vaccines by age six, each vaccine of which contains multiple 'inactive' antigenic and\/or immunotoxic\u00c2\u00a0agents, e.g. preservatives, biological agents, adjuvants.

The manufacturer Merck's own product warning links MMR to a potentially fatal form of brain inflammation caused by measles. Why is this evidence not being reported?\nThe phenomenon of measles infection spread by MMR (live measles-mumps-rubella vaccine) has been known for decades. In fact, 20 years ago, scientists working at the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases, funded by the WHO and the National Vaccine Program, discovered something truly disturbing about the MMR vaccine: it leads to detectable measles infection in the vast majority of those who receive it.\nPublished in 1995 in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology and titled, \"Detection of Measles Virus RNA in Urine Specimens from Vaccine Recipients,\" researchers analyzed urine samples from newly MMR vaccinated 15-month-old children and young adults and reported their eye-opening results as following:\nThe authors of this study used a relatively new technology at that time, namely, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which they believed could help resolve growing challenges associated with measles detection in the shifting post-mass immunization epidemiological and clinical landscape. These challenges include:\nTwenty years later, PCR testing is widely acknowledged as highly sensitive and specific, and the only efficient way to distinguish vaccine-strain and wild-type measles infection, as their clinical presentation are indistinguishable.\nThe latest measles outbreak at Disney is a perfect example of where PCR testing could be used to ascertain the true origins of the outbreak. The a priori assumption that the non-vaccinated are carriers and transmitters of a disease the vaccinated are immune to has not been scientifically validated. Since vaccine strain measles has almost entirely supplanted wild-type, communally acquired measles, it is statistically unlikely that PCR tests will reveal the media's hysterical storyline -- \"non-vaxxers brought back an eradicated disease!\" --\u00c2\u00a0 to be true. Until such studies are performed and exposed, we will never know for certain.\nLaura Hayes, of Age of Autism, recently addressed this key question in her insightful article \"Disney, Measles, and the Fantasyland of Vaccine Perfection\":\nThe National Vaccine Information Center has published an important document relevant to this topic titled \"The Emerging Risks of Live Virus & Virus Vectored Vaccines: Vaccine Strain Virus Infection, Shedding & Transmission.\" Pages 34-36 in the section on \"Measles, Mumps, Rubella Viruses and Live Attenuated Measles, Mumps, Rubella Viruses\" discuss evidence that the MMR vaccine can lead to measles infection and transmission.\nCases highlighted include:\n \t\tIn 2010, Eurosurveillance published a report about excretion of vaccine strain measles virus in urine and pharyngeal secretions of a Croatian child with vaccine-associated rash illness.[1] A healthy 14-month old child was given MMR vaccine and eight days later developed macular rash and fever. Lab testing of throat and urine samples between two and four weeks after vaccination tested positive for vaccine strain measles virus. Authors of the report pointed out that when children experience a fever and rash after MMR vaccination, only molecular lab testing can determine whether the symptoms are due to vaccine strain measles virus infection. They stated: \"According to WHO guidelines for measles and rubella elimination, routine discrimination between aetiologies of febrile rash disease is done by virus detection. However, in a patient recently MMR-vaccinated, only molecular techniques can differentiate between wild type measles or rubella infection or vaccine-associated disease. This case report demonstrates that excretion of Schwartz measles virus occurs in vaccinees.\"\n \t\tIn 2012, Pediatric Child Health published a report describing a healthy 15-month old child in Canada, who developed irritability, fever, cough, conjunctivitis and rash within seven days of an MMR shot.[2] Blood, urine and throat swab tests were positive for vaccine strain measles virus infection 12 days after vaccination. Addressing the potential for measles vaccine strain virus transmission to others, the authors stated, \"While the attenuated virus can be detected in clinical specimens following immunization, it is understood that administration of the MMR vaccine to immunocompetent individuals does not carry the risk of secondary transmission to susceptible hosts.\n \t\tIn 2013, Eurosurveillance published a report of vaccine strain measles occurring weeks after MMR vaccination in Canada. Authors stated, \"We describe a case of measlesmumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine-associated measles illness that was positive by both PCR and IgM, five weeks after administration of the MMR vaccine.\" The case involved a two-year-old child, who developed runny nose, fever, cough, macular rash and conjunctivitis after vaccination and tested positive for vaccine strain measles virus infection in throat swab and blood tests.[3] Canadian health officials authoring the report raised the question of whether there are unidentified cases of vaccine strain measles infections and the need to know more about how long measles vaccine strain shedding lasts. They concluded that the case they reported \"likely represents the existence of additional, but unidentified, exceptions to the typical timeframe for measles vaccine virus shedding and illness.\" They added that \"further investigation is needed on the upper limit of measles vaccine virus shedding based on increased sensitivity of the RT-PCR-based detection technologies and immunological factors associated with vaccine-associated measles illness and virus shedding.\"\nIn addition to this evidence for the disease-promoting nature of the measles vaccine, we recently reported on a case of a twice vaccinated adult in NYC becoming infected with measles and then spreading it to two secondary contacts, both of which were vaccinated twice and found to have presumably protective IgM antibodies.\nThis double failure of the MMR vaccine renders highly suspicious the unsubstantiated claims that when an outbreak of measles occurs the non- or minimally vaccinated are responsible. The assumption that vaccination equals bona fide immunity has never been supported by the evidence itself. We have previously reported on a growing body of evidence that even when a vaccine is mandated, and 99% of a population receive the measles vaccines, outbreaks not only happen, but as compliance increases vaccine resistance sporadic outbreaks also increase -- a clear indication of vaccine failure.\nThere is also the concerning fact that according to the MMR vaccine's manufacturer Merck's own product insert, the MMR can cause measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE), a rare but potentially lethal form of brain infection with measles.\u00c2\u00a0 For more information you can review a case report on MIBE caused by vaccine strain measles published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in 1999 titled \"Measles inclusion-body encephalitis caused by the vaccine strain of measles virus.\"\nChina is not the only country dealing with outbreaks in near universally vaccinated populations. Between 2008-2011, France reported over 20,000 cases of measles, with adolescents and young adults accounting for more than half of cases.[4] Remarkably, these outbreaks began when France was experiencing some of their highest coverage rates in history. For instance, in 2008, the MMR1 coverage reached 96.6% in children 11 years of age. For a more extensive review of measles outbreaks in vaccinated populations read our article The 2013 Measles Outbreak: A Failing Vaccine, Not A Failure to Vaccinate.\nGiven that clinical evidence, case reports, epidemiological studies, and even the vaccine manufacturer's own product warnings, all show directly or indirectly that MMR can spread measles infection, how can we continue to stand by and let the media, government and medical establishment blame the non-vaccinated on these outbreaks without any concrete evidence?\n[1]\u00c2\u00a0 Kaic B, Gjenero-Margan I, Aleraj B.

The Canadian Paediatric Society and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization strongly recommend routine immunization.\nThe MMR vaccine is a three-in-one needle that protects against measles, mumps and rubella (German measles). It should be given to children soon after their first birthday. A second dose is given in combination with varicella (chicken pox), as MMRV (a four-in-one needle) at 4-6 years of age. Vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella is required by law for all children attending school in Ontario (unless exempted).\nThis vaccine should also be given to adults who are not protected against measles, mumps or rubella. Pregnant women who have been told that they are not protected against rubella, should receive MMR vaccine as soon as they are no longer pregnant.\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral  infection that is spread through the air from person to person.\u00c2\u00a0 \n Measles lives  in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. It can spread to others  through coughing and sneezing. Also, measles virus can remain for up to two  hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or  sneezed. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected  surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected. \nSymptoms of measles begin seven to 21  days, usually 10 to 14 days, after exposure to a case of measles and include  fever, runny nose, cough, drowsiness, irritability and red eyes. Small white  spots (known as \"Koplik's spots\") can appear on the inside of the  mouth and throat, but are not always present. Then, three to seven days after  the start of the symptoms, a red blotchy rash appears on the face and then  progresses down the body.\u00c2\u00a0 Measles is  contagious one day before fever develops and usually four days before the rash  appears. Measles remains contagious until four days after the appearance of the  rash.\n           Most people fully recover from measles within two  to three weeks. But measles can cause complications in up to 25 per cent of  people, such as pneumonia, ear infections, diarrhea, hearing loss, encephalitis  (brain swelling), seizures, or, rarely, even death.\u00c2\u00a0 Measles can be especially dangerous for infants, those  with weakened immune systems and pregnant women. \nMumps  is a contagious disease that is caused by the mumps virus. Mumps is spread by  droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected  person, usually when the person coughs or sneezes. Items used by an infected  person, such as cups or utensils can also be contaminated with the virus, which  may spread to others if those items are shared. In addition, the virus may  spread when someone with mumps touches items or surfaces without washing their  hands and someone else then touches the same surface and rubs their mouth or  nose.\u00c2\u00a0 \nSymptoms  typically appear 16 to 18 days after infection, but this period can range from  12 to 25 days after infection. Mumps is best known for the swelling of the  cheeks and jaw that it causes, which is a result of parotitis (inflammation of  the salivary glands). Mumps also causes fever and headache. Mumps can be contagious from seven days before and up to five  days after the  salivary glands begin to swell. Up to  half of people who get mumps have very mild or no symptoms, and therefore do  not know they were infected with mumps. \nPeople  who show symptoms usually recover after a week or two, but mumps can  occasionally cause serious complications.\u00c2\u00a0  The most common complication is orchitis (swelling of the testicles) in  males who have reached puberty; rarely does this lead to fertility problems.  Other rare complications include encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and\/or meningitis  (swelling of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord) and oophoritis (swelling  of the ovaries) in females who have reached puberty and deafness. Mumps infection during the first trimester of pregnancy  may increase the risk of a miscarriage. \nRubella is a contagious disease  caused by a virus. Rubella is spread by contact with an infected person,  through coughing and sneezing. \nSymptoms typically appear about 14 to 21 days after being exposed to someone who was  contagious. \n           The  infection is usually mild with fever, rash, headache, malaise, mild runny nose  (coryza) and red eyes (conjunctivitis).\u00c2\u00a0 The rash usually starts on the  face and spreads to the rest of the body.\u00c2\u00a0  These symptoms last approximately three days. Rubella is contagious one week before  and at least four days after the appearance of the rash. About  half of the people who get rubella do not have symptoms.\u00c2\u00a0 \nComplications  are not common, but they occur more often in adults. Aching joints  occur in many cases, especially among young women.\u00c2\u00a0 In rare  cases, rubella can cause serious problems, including encephalitis (swelling of  the brain).\u00c2\u00a0 Rubella is most dangerous for a pregnant  woman's unborn baby. Infection during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, or birth  defects like deafness, blindness, intellectual disability, and heart defects. \nThe effectiveness of a single  dose of measles-containing vaccine given at 12 or 15 months of age is estimated  to be 85 per cent to 95 per cent. With a second dose, effectiveness is  approximately 97 per cent. Effectiveness of  mumps vaccination after one dose is estimated to be between 62 per cent and 91  per cent and between 76 per cent and 95 per cent after two doses.\u00c2\u00a0 At least 95 per cent of  individuals develop rubella immunity after a single dose.\u00c2\u00a0 Protection from measles, mumps and rubella after getting the vaccine is  life-long and further doses are not required. \nThe MMR vaccine is safe and  effective. Most individuals will have no reaction. The vaccine can cause a malaise  and fever, possibly with a rash, in approximately five per cent of children six  to 23 days \u00c2\u00a0after MMR immunization.  Allergic reactions to the MMR vaccine are very rare. There is no evidence that  the MMR vaccine causes autism. \n           The vaccine is safe for  household members of people with immune system problems and household members  of pregnant women. Breastfeeding women can receive the MMR vaccine. \n         Speak with your health care  provider or local public health unit about the benefits and risks of the vaccine, as  well as the risks of not getting vaccinated. \nThere are some groups who should generally not be given the vaccine such as, but not limited to:\nPeople who have problems with their  immune system should speak with their health care provider to determine when  MMR vaccine should be given. The vaccine is safe for household members of  people with immune system problems. \nTalk  to your health care  provider  or call your local public health unit.\nAfter you or your child receives any immunization, make sure the doctor  updates the personal immunization record, the \"Yellow Card\".

So it is time to re-publish some facts about measles and the measles vaccine that the mainstream media does not seem to want to publish.\nHere at Health Impact News we have received requests to interview \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parents who are anti-vaccine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our response is: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why? Why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you interview medical doctors who are anti-vaccine?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe truth is that medical doctors who are opposed to vaccines do not fit their agenda, or the agenda of their advertisers, which includes the very powerful pharmaceutical industry. Thus, you will almost never hear an interview with such articulate physicians such as Dr. Sherri Tenpenny or Dr. Suzanne Humphries in the mainstream media. We provide two such interviews, one with each doctor, below.\nWas the Introduction of the Measles Vaccine Responsible for Wiping Out Measles?\nby Roman Bystrianyk and Suzanne Humphries, MD\nIn the case of measles, the death rate had declined by almost 100 percent (before the introduction of the vaccine.)\nAnalysis of the data shows this often-repeated mantra that vaccines were key in the decline of infectious disease deaths is a fallacy. Deaths had decreased by massive amounts before vaccinations. In the case of scarlet fever and other infectious diseases, deaths declined to near zero without any widespread vaccination.\nUnfortunately, this erroneous belief has led people to trust in vaccination as the sole way to handle infectious diseases when there were clearly other factors that caused mortality to decline. Those factors were improved hygiene, sanitation, nutrition, labor laws, electricity, chlorination, refrigeration, pasteurization, and many other facets that we now generally take for granted as part of modern life. Very little of the improvement in the death rate had anything to do with medicine. A 1977 report estimated that, at best, approximately 3 percent of the mortality decline from infectious disease could be attributed to modern medical care.\nIn general, medical measures (both chemotherapeutic and prophylactic) appear to have contributed little to the overall decline in mortality in the United States since about 1900\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhaving in many instances been introduced several decades after a marked decline had already set in and having no detectable influence in most instances. More specifically, with reference to those five conditions (influenza, pneumonia, diphtheria, whooping cough, and poliomyelitis) for which the decline in mortality appears substantial after the point of intervention\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand on the unlikely assumption that all of this decline is attributable to the intervention . . . it is estimated that at most 3.5 percent of the total decline in mortality since 1900 could be ascribed to medical measures introduced for the diseases considered here. [5]\nThe emphasis today on more and more vaccines, is in part built on this ingrained thinking. The fact that deaths from infectious diseases declined so greatly before vaccines and antibiotics, is ignored. This lapse in study has created a situation where we could have learned a better way to manage all infections in a more comprehensive way. Yet, to this day, despite such a phenomenal transformation, we have failed to learn the lessons of this history. The solutions that led to a 99 percent decline in death has been ignored, with the entire emphasis on the final 1 percent, which would have occurred anyway even without a vaccine.\nHowever, in some corners, there is recognition that vaccines were not what caused the major decline in infectious disease mortality. They often erroneously point to antibiotics and improved medical care and grudgingly give some credit to sanitation and other factors. There is little curiosity as to how all these factors worked and how they still apply today. The shift on emphasis is now on the incidence of disease after vaccination with a decreased emphasis on mortality. The thinking goes that, by wiping out the disease with vaccines, there is no risk of death. This appears to be a reasonable approach. How well has it worked?\nLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take whooping cough as an example. In 1979 Sweden withdrew use of the DTP vaccine on the basis that it was not effective and possibly unsafe. The fear, of course, would be that with lower vaccination rates, the death rate would increase. So what happened in this case?\nA 1995 letter from Victoria Romanus at the Swedish Institute of Infectious Disease Control indicated that deaths from whooping cough remained near zero. Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population was 8,294,000 in 1979 and 8,831,000 by 1995. From 1981 to 1993, eight children were recorded as dying, with the cause of death listed as pertussis. This averaged to be about 0.6 children per year possibly dying from whooping cough. These numbers show that the odds of dying from pertussis in Sweden were about 1 in 13,000,000 even when there was no national vaccination program. [6]\nIn another case, DTP vaccination coverage in England dropped from about 78 percent to 30 or 40 percent because of concerns over safety. The assumption was that there would be an increase in deaths due to the decreased coverage. The years from 1976 to 1980 were the ones when vaccination rates were at their lowest. Using official statistics, the number of deaths in those years totaled 35. The deaths from the previous five years (1971 to 1975), while vaccination rates were higher, totaled 55, or about 1.5 times greater than when vaccination rates were lower. [7] This was directly opposite what is generally believed should have happened.\nAnd have whooping cough rates really been controlled? The sad truth is that whooping cough never really went away and is endemic. Huge numbers of people still cough from Bordetella pertussis, the bacteria involved in whooping cough. Because of waning vaccine- immunity, up to one-third of persistent coughs are whooping cough.\nAlthough pertussis traditionally has been considered a disease of childhood, it was well-documented in adults nearly a century ago and is currently recognized as an important cause of respiratory disease in adolescents and adults, including the elderly. Because of waning immunity, adult and adolescent pertussis can occur even when there is a history of full immunization or natural disease . . . Studies from Canada, Denmark, Germany, France, and the United States indicate that between 12 and 32% of adults and adolescents with a coughing illness for at least 1 week are infected with Bordetella pertussis. [8]\nLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on another infectious disease\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmeasles. Keep in mind that by 1963, almost no one died from measles. During this year, the whole of New England had only five deaths (Maine: 1, New Hampshire: 0, Vermont: 3, Massachusetts: 0, Rhode Island: 1, Connecticut: 0) that were attributed to measles. [9] Deaths from asthma were actually 56 times greater than from measles during that year.\nBut did incidence decline as vaccine proponents emphasize? There are some graphs you can find on the Internet that claim there was little decrease in incidence. The graph I have seen that shows this only has a few data points and a line between two distant points in time. This graph is of poor quality and draws an incorrect conclusion. Looking at more comprehensive incidence data, we can see a drop in incidence in 1963 at the introduction of the measles vaccine.\nMeasles incidence did apparently dramatically drop after 1963. But can this drop be completely attributed to the success of the measles vaccine? The early measles vaccine that contained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153killed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd virus was an aluminum-precipitated vaccine produced from formaldehyde-inactivated monkey kidney cell cultures. A study from 1967 revealed that the vaccine could cause pneumonia as well as encephalopathy (inflammation of the brain).\nThe killed vaccines were quickly abandoned. [11] But there were also significant issues with the live vaccines, which were not highly attenuated and produced a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modified measles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rash in about half of those injected\u00e2\u20ac\u201dessentially equivalent to a case of measles. Forty-eight percent of people had rash, and 83 percent had fevers up to 106\u00c2\u00b0F post-injection.\nSo how did measles incidence drop so dramatically after the 1963 vaccine? In part, it had to do with a definition. If you had a high fever and you had a vaccine, of course you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have measles even if you were sicker than you would have been if you contracted measles naturally.\nBack in the 1960s, it was expected that a single shot would protect you for life without serious effects, which would later turn out not to be true.\nClaims were even made in the 1960s that only a certain number of children needed to be vaccinated in order to wipe out measles.\nMore than a decade later, the objective of measles elimination was still not achieved. There were repeat epidemics that happened throughout the United States.\nIn the same year, after three types of measles vaccines had failed to produce eradication or even predictable herd immunity, vaccine scientists changed course from one shot and stated that, in using the new live vaccine, two doses would be required for reliable protection. They also recommended that everyone under the age of 32 be revaccinated because the old vaccines they received were inadequate. The single shot once promised to provide lifelong immunity against measles in the 1960s was never produced.\nAnd was the measles incidence declining before 1963 anyway? Looking at the measles incidence data, the trend line shows that incidence was on the decline.\nIn fact, if that trend line held, measles incidence would have hit zero by around the year 2000. This is actually the year when the CDC declared measles had been eliminated from the United States.\nSo were all these vaccines worth the cost, effort, and adverse reactions to tackle what was by 1963 considered a mild childhood illness?\nWhen we hear about vaccines, we are often told a simple story of how they stimulate antibodies. The theory goes that the stimulation of antibodies creates a memory of a disease so the next time you encounter it, your body will quickly defeat the enemy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice, simple, and easy-to-remember story.\nBelieving you understand the immune system because you hear the words \u00e2\u20ac\u0153antibodies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protection\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mentioned together is like thinking you know how a car really works because you see it has wheels. The immune system is a highly complex, still-poorly understood entity, composed of many different cell lines, each producing different chemicals that are released into the blood. These chemicals are used by the body and are affected by age, stress, nutritional status, environment, and a whole host of factors that are barely understood.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153. . . the immune system remains a black box,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Garry Fathman, MD, a professor of immunology and rheumatology and associate director of the Institute for Immunology, Transplantation and Infection . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggeringly complex, comprising at least 15 different interacting cell types that spew dozens of different molecules into the blood to communicate with one another and to do battle. Within each of those cells sit tens of thousands of genes whose activity can be altered by age, exercise, infection, vaccination status, diet, stress, you name it. . . . That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an awful lot of moving parts. And we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know what the vast majority of them do, or should be doing . . . [15]\nThe immune system is traditionally divided into the humoral immune system that is involved with antibodies and the cellular immune system that does not involve antibodies but entails the activation of various cells such as natural killer cells. What we do know is that, contrary to popular belief,\u00c2\u00a0antibodies are not necessary when it comes to full measles recovery.\nChildren with a deficit in antibody production, called agamma-globulinemia, recover from measles just as well as normal antibody producers, and this has been known since the late 1960s when vaccines were being developed and advanced. But antibody response is really the only thing that is talked about and promoted when it comes to vaccines. Because this knowledge disturbed the simplistic antibody-protection paradigm, it was considered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disconcerting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd discovery in this 1968 medical paper.\nHow does nutrition play a role in disease? Discovered in the 1920s, vitamin A was dubbed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-infective\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vitamin. It alone has a tremendous impact on measles deaths. During the 1990s, mortality reductions of 60 to 90 percent were measured in poor countries using vitamin A in hospitalized measles cases.\nAvailability of vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables was another factor in disease morbidity and mortality reduction. There were improving trends in overall nutrition, as seen by a parallel in the decline in deaths from measles and the vitamin C deficiency disease, scurvy. Experiments done in the 1940s showed that vitamin C was effective against measles, especially when used in higher doses.\nIn the early 1900s, other treatments were being successfully used to treat measles. In 1919 Dr. Drummond commented that cinnamon oil was an effective prophylactic against measles or that it made measles milder.\nNutrition and other factors have a big impact on measles, so why aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we talking about them at all? Because the emphasis is always on a single, highly lucrative medical procedure\u00e2\u20ac\u201dvaccination. This sole paradigm has swept virtually all other strategies to the wayside.\n Another key factor to consider is that measles vaccine does not create lifelong immunity, whereas natural infection with measles does. The only way to remain immune with artificial immunity via vaccines is to be vaccinated several times during a lifetime. We have not yet seen how the vaccine will play out over several generations of exclusively vaccinated people. Epidemics are likely to become more common in the future.\nA 2009 study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society investigated what could happen with waning measles vaccine immunity even with high vaccine coverage among children. They predicted that, after a long disease-free period in the population, the introduction of infection will lead to far larger epidemics than predicted by standard models.\nWe can foresee that vaccination will have two conflicting effects . . . it will reduce the number of newborn susceptibles and hence should have some of the usual associated public-health benefits reducing the number of cases in young children. However, this reduction in cases will lead to a reduction in boosting and therefore a greater susceptibility to infection in older age classes . . . When immunity wanes, vaccination has a far more limited impact on the average number of cases. While this observation has clear public-health implications, the dynamic consequences of the interaction between vaccination, waning immunity and boosting are far more striking. For high levels of vaccination (greater than 80%) and moderate levels of waning immunity (greater than 30 years), large-scale epidemic cycles can be induced. [21]\nA 1984 study [22] reported that by 2050, the proportion of measles susceptibles may be greater than in the pre-vaccine era. So have we created a ticking time bomb with waning immunity? Will there actually be bigger measles epidemics in the future? If there are, the response will probably be to blame the unvaccinated, which has in fact been done for over 100 years, and then to enforce more vaccinations upon different age groups.\nBecause of the zealous pro-vaccine bias that permeates society, the true forces that drove the major decline in deaths from infectious diseases are not acknowledged. At most, there is a slight admission that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sanitation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has some effect, but better medical care and antibiotics are still given the credit.\nGroups of individuals who have anointed themselves as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153skeptics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd seek to derail anything that questions vaccination. The definition of skeptic used to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one who instinctively or habitually doubts, questions, or disagrees with assertions or generally accepted conclusions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but this definition in its modern usage has been hijacked and transformed to someone that essentially blindly supports any orthodox position as gospel. These people will continue on their crusade of supporting vaccines at all costs and to assail anything that might question their myopic view. If those people had a desire to learn the truth, perhaps they would peek beneath the hood of infectious diseases and vaccines, and learn a little more. Imagine what could be in the trunk!\nArticle Source here.\nDr. Suzanne Humphries\nDr. Suzanne Humphries, a practicing nephrologist (kidney physician), says the vaccine industry isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving people both sides of the story, and parents need to get informed before subjecting their children to vaccines that can potentially cause serious harm or even death. She points out the reasoning of the government and pharmaceutical industry in claiming that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153people are too stupid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to notice that vaccines are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153miraculous,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and so they are going to give out vaccines anyway.\nQuotes:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why must such a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwonderful product\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 be forced on people?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inventors of vaccines have chosen a belief system whereby infants are all born with inadequate immune systems (and therefore need to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153saved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from diseases by vaccines).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nDr. Humphries states that most doctors\u00c2\u00a0think Mother Nature is flawed. \u00c2\u00a0The doctor doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to take care of an immune system, because the doctor was never taught in medical school how to take care of an immune system. What you end up with is a whole society, from start to finish, that does not know how an immune system works, does not know how to take care of it, does not know how to replenish the nutrients and minerals that are needed, does not know how to ingest a diet that will support it, and then when it fails, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault. We need a vaccine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nArticles by Dr. Suzanne Humphries\nDr. Sherri Tenpenny\nDr. Sherri Tenpenny is a doctor of osteopathy and\u00c2\u00a0the director and founder of OsteoMed II, a clinic established in 1996 in Ohio. Dr. Tenpenny talks about the lack of safety studies conducted on vaccines, pointing out that studies are only conducted on healthy individuals which are not representative of a large part of society that vaccines are given to. People who are chronically sick and are taking many different kinds of medications are never studied.\nDr. Tenpenny also discusses whether or not vaccines are effective, pointing out the difference between \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccine antibodies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and natural immunity. She helps people understand that when a claim is made saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccines are effective\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it simply means it effectively created an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153antibody\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a specific disease, but not that it has proven to prevent the person from contracting that disease. She discusses the growing number of cases in the U.S. where disease outbreaks are occurring among the vaccinated populations, who have been fully vaccinated for the disease from which they are suffering.\nComment on this story at VaccineImpact.com\nBibliography:\n1.

Thanks to vaccines, serious and often fatal diseases like polio, that were once common, are now only distant memories for most Americans.\nVaccines are the safest way to protect you, your children and your community from a long list of serious and potentially life-threatening illnesses. Vaccines protect you by preparing your immune system to recognize and fight serious, and sometimes deadly, diseases including:\nFrom infants to senior citizens, getting vaccines on time is one of the most important ways to protect yourself and others from serious diseases and infections. If you are a parent, the New York State Department of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics all recommend that you keep your children up-to-date with the recommended vaccination schedule. It's also important for adults to be sure that they have received all the vaccines recommended for adults.\nVaccines teach your body's immune system to recognize infections so it can fight them off in the future. This video helps explain how vaccines work with your immune system to keep you from getting sick:\nWhen you get vaccinated, you not only protect yourself but you also help protect the people around you who might be too young or too sick to get vaccinated themselves. This is called \"community immunity\" or \"herd immunity\". If enough people stopped getting vaccinated, outbreaks of now-rare vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, could return.\nThe New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Bureau of Immunization is here to help you find reliable information on vaccines and immunization. The Bureau's mission is to reduce illnesses, complications and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases in New Yorkers of all ages. Our goals are to assure that:\nIf you have a question about vaccines and you live in the five boroughs of New York City - Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens or Staten Island - please call the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Immunization Hotline at 347-396-2400 or visit their website for more information.\nIn New York State outside of New York City, please contact the NYSDOH Bureau of Immunization at 518-473-4437 or by email at immunize@health.ny.gov.\n","85":"The UK Immunisation schedule recommends that children be given two doses of the MMR vaccine, the first at 12 months of age, and the second at 3-5 years of age. For more information\u00c2\u00a0see  \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat is immunisation?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy do we immunise?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\nImmunisation of children is not compulsory in the UK, as it is in some other countries, so parents choose whether or not to have their child immunised. The overwhelming majority of parents believe in immunisation for their children. We have however included here the views of a few parents who do not believe immunisation is right for their own child based on their personal beliefs. Their views represent a small proportion of the population.\u00c2\u00a0 \nIt is absolutely right and normal that parents are concerned about the optimal health of their children but it is important that parents seek reliable scientific evidence on which to base their decisions and there is now a mass of this information available (see \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcResources & Information\u00e2\u20ac\u2122  section' Medical Research on MMR, Autism and bowel diseases). \nEvery parent should have access to a trained health professional to chat about the risks of catching the diseases and about the benefits and potential risks of immunisation for their own child, and the population in general. In addition to their GP, health visitor or practice nurse, there is also an immunisation advisor in each local health protection unit, whom parents can talk to about their child's immunisations.\u00c2\u00a0 \nAlthough the weight of scientific evidence shows that MMR is safe, some parents continue to have initial concerns about the risk to their child and making the decision whether or not to give their child MMR is a difficult one. The majority of parents do decide to immunise their children with MMR. . \nA small number of parents that we interviewed had either decided not to immunise their child at all against measles, mumps and rubella or had chosen to have them immunised using single vaccines.\u00c2\u00a0Here, they explain their personal reasons for their decision. \nThey had concerns about possible reactions from the vaccine \nParents who decided not to give their child MMR were concerned that the vaccine might cause a reaction in their child. Most children who have the MMR vaccine do not have any problems with it, or if reactions do occur they are usually mild. \u00c2\u00a0One couple whose children were lactose intolerant held a personal belief that, because of their health problems, their children would be at risk of a reaction if they had the MMR or the single vaccines.\n   The reason we decided to go for individual is one, isn't so much from the reports so much on television about how that doctor was supposedly discredited for his decisions or for the points he'd made and all the rest of it was down to the fact, this is, might sound really silly, basically the simple question, when Tony Blair was asked, 'What's yours?' he didn't answer. That's really stupid probably but really simple at the same time. If there is nothing wrong, what is wrong with his answering it? So based on, with some other information that we read up and also speaking to friends who were doctors, or friends of friends that had doctors as friends, we've just thought, 'No. We're going to go for the individual' when we had to come to it. \n   I'm confused. My main concern is I don't know what to think. I've done quite a lot of reading about it over the last three years since my son was born. Before my son was born I wasn't really that involved. I have a relative who is, who's a GP who is very pro the vaccination as, as a social responsibility. She feels it's my responsibility to have my son vaccinated although she doesn't pressurise me and I have a sister who is at the opposite end. She has MS and she's very into finding out about her own condition. And when I had my son she was very interested in finding out about vaccinations and especially the MMR. She made me think about what's been happening recently.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \nHalf, well not half of me, a little bit of me thinks, 'Well if he does get something mildly then that's, that's better than a vaccination.' I had mumps and measles when I was a kid. The MMR wasn't around, wasn't around when I was, when I was young. I don't really understand now why it seems to be more, more frightening, a frightening illness than it used to be. I don't know whether its more potent, whether there are stronger strains of measles coming in to the country from other countries. I'm not sure of the facts but it certainly seems when I was a child that everyone I know had measles and most of us were fine although my cousin went deaf in one ear as a result of his measles. But most of us were fine with it but because of the worries are being raised about it, you know you think well maybe my son will be the one child that gets measles and then ends up badly brain damaged and it's not a risk I'm going to take.\u00c2\u00a0 \nBut I, he has a vitamin tablet and that's all. And I did read somewhere that vitamin A is meant to be quite a good way of fighting certain illnesses. I think in 'What Doctors Don't Tell You' they gave a list of alternative preventatives and one of that, one of those was a vitamin, a high vitamin A dose. He eats a healthy diet and he has a vitamin tablet every morning so that's all I do [laugh]. \nAlthough numerous research studies since 1988, conducted in different countries have produced good scientific evidence to suggest there is\u00c2\u00a0 not a link between\u00c2\u00a0MMR, autism and bowel disease, a very small number of parents were anxious that previous reactions that their older children had, which they personally believed were triggered by MMR, might occur with their younger children. (See 'Severe and disputed reactions to MMR'). \u00c2\u00a0\n   Mother' \u00c2\u00a0If the research is properly read, it becomes very apparent that these various researchers, including the very much maligned gastroenterologist, who is in everybody's mind, he doesn't say, that's it affects every child. He's actually talking about a subset. He's talking about a small group. But if we could get past all this contention to the point where they can say, 'Right, well, let's identify these children so they are no longer at risk, take them out of the loop'. Look at a different way of addressing these problems. But until they get past that and treat parents with respect, as individuals who've got minds and thought process and the ability to reason. And until they start listening to researchers and accept that the, they're not actually trying to cause a blanket scare' they're not trying to, then we know, we're not going to get past this.\u00c2\u00a0 \nAnd as long as this situation stays in place, our youngest baby, our baby will not be vaccinated, at all, and we will regard all medicines with extreme circumspection. We're actually having another baby and that baby won't be vaccinated and the same will hold true. And we're looking at every other way we can to protect our two youngest children because we've, this is not a decision we've taken lightly. And I would want to make that absolutely plain to anybody whose looking on this on website. It's not an easy decision and neither you nor I, would say it's an easy' \nFather' \u00c2\u00a0No, well due to the MMR, we, we took seven years to find out what we believe is the truth and that's based on what we're doing now, and that's no vaccinations whatsoever. \nThey had concerns about the safety of the vaccine \nThe combined MMR has been used in the UK since 1988 and in the USA since the early 1970s. (See 'Deciding to give my child MMR'.) However some parents were concerned that the long-term effects of the combined MMR vaccine were not known. Other reasons given for deciding not to go ahead with MMR were concern about the ingredients of the vaccines and that live vaccines were used and that these would be too much for a child's body to cope with. There has been no scientific evidence to suggest this is the case. The viruses in a live vaccine have been weakened to give immunity with no, or very mild symptoms.\n   And some of the other ingredients seem to be an unlikely, candidates to be in such, in something that you're going to put into your body. Also I just personally feel that such a small child has a very weak and perhaps undeveloped immune system, and I just feel that it's very difficult to bombard it with so many diseases if you like all in one time. And certainly with the MMR when they're all live vaccines I just find it, you know, I just personally feel that it's a lot for a small body to actually fight and to cope with. \nThey believed that immunity from natural infection is better than from immunisation \nA very small number of parents personally believed that immunity derived from actually having the disease was more effective than the immunity obtained from vaccines. These beliefs applied to all immunisations, not just to MMR. No immunisation is 100% effective but it does offer a high level of immunity from infectious diseases. \u00c2\u00a0Gaining immunity from actually having the disease involves the risk of a child developing a complication. \nHow parents protect their child from these diseases \nParents who decided against letting their child have MMR stressed that deciding not to immunise was not an easy decision to make, and not one they had taken lightly. Some of them did say that they were continually reassessing their decision when any changes were introduced to the immunisation programme and that they might immunise when their children were older. A very small number of these parents gave their children a daily Vitamin A supplement in the belief that it would strengthen their immune system should they catch any of the diseases. While it is true that a child with an underlying health condition is more likely to have complications and\/or die from measles, healthy children can be very ill too. Allowing them to catch the diseases means that they run the risk of complications. \nFeelings now about decision made \nParents who decided that their child should not have MMR or that they should be given single vaccines said they were generally happy with the decision they had made. Some of these parents were certain they had made the right decision for their child. A couple of parents were considering giving a single rubella vaccine to their daughters to protect them as they reached puberty. A single rubella vaccine is not currently available on the NHS. \nThe rubella part of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is given to a young child rather than teenage girls, so that if a child caught the disease they can't pass it on to\u00c2\u00a0pregnant women.\u00c2\u00a0Once it became clear that immunisation at an early age would protect for many years, it was decided to immunise both girls and boys in order to stop the spread of rubella in children, and so gain 'herd immunity'.\n   We're fine about it. We don't have, we feel like there's some concern taken out in the sense that we don't have to worry about any side-effects. But then again we don't know. We've just based our decision on the fact, 'Well, it's gone on for this many years and, single, and that's just the way we prefer to stay with it'. She wasn't distressed. I think we, if, we would have been, if she, after the first immunisation if she'd been really distressed then we might be thinking, 'Oh, my God, maybe we should have gone for the 3-in-1, then she doesn't have to go through this again'. But she hasn't been concerned at all about what's going on. So, no, we've been comfortable with it. She, we were told after the first immunisation also actually that she might have a reaction to it. That was a surprise. And they said, you know, 'Within seven days, you know, if she's okay, within, you know, after seven days, she'll be fine'. But again you always kind of wonder as a parent, 'Well, they say seven days but, hey, my daughter's, obviously each case is different, she could be ten days'.

It is usually mild, but it can be serious, especially in young infants and adults.\nIt causes a rash, itching, fever, and tiredness.\nIt can lead to severe skin infection, scars, pneumonia, brain damage, or death.\nThe chickenpox virus can be spread from person to person through the air, or by contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters.\nA person who has had chickenpox can get a painful rash called shingles years later.\nBefore the vaccine, about 11,000 people were hospitalized for chickenpox each year in the United States.\nBefore the vaccine, about 100 people died each year as a result of chickenpox in the United States.\nChickenpox vaccine can prevent chickenpox.\nMost people who get chickenpox vaccine will not get chickenpox. But if someone who has been vaccinated does get chickenpox, it is usually very mild. They will have fewer blisters, are less likely to have a fever, and will recover faster.\nChildren who have never had chickenpox should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine at these ages:\n1st Dose: 12-15 months of age \n2nd Dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 3 months after the 1st dose)\u00c2\u00a0\nPeople 13 years of age and older (who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine) should get two doses at least 28 days apart.\nAnyone who is not fully vaccinated, and never had chickenpox, should receive one or two doses of chickenpox vaccine. The timing of these doses depends on the person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s age.

The risk of chickenpox vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.\nGetting chickenpox vaccine is much safer than getting chickenpox disease. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it.

The fact is vaccines save lives and protect against the spread of disease. If you decide not to immunize, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not only putting your child at risk to catch a disease that is dangerous or deadly but also putting others in contact with your child at risk.\u00c2\u00a0Getting vaccinated is much better than getting the disease.\nIndeed, some of the most devastating diseases that affect children have been greatly reduced or eradicated completely thanks to vaccination. Today, we protect children and teens from 16 diseases  that can have a terrible effect on their young victims if left unvaccinated.\nYour pediatrician knows that you care about your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health and safety. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why you need to get all the scientific facts from a medical professional you can trust before making any decisions based on stories you may have seen or heard on TV, the Internet, or from other parents.\u00c2\u00a0\nVaccines work.\u00c2\u00a0They have kept children healthy and have saved millions of lives for more than 50 years. Most childhood vaccines are 90% to 99%\u00c2\u00a0effective in preventing disease. And if a vaccinated child does get the disease, the symptoms are usually less serious than in a child who hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been vaccinated. There may be mild side effects, like swelling where the shot was given, but they do not last long. And it is\u00c2\u00a0rare for side effects to be serious.\nVaccines are safe. Before a vaccine is licensed in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews all aspects of development, including where and how the vaccine is made and the studies that have been conducted in people who received the vaccine. The FDA will not license a vaccine unless it meets standards for effectiveness (how well the vaccine works) and safety. Results of studies get reviewed again by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians before a licensed vaccine is officially recommended to be given to children. Every lot of vaccine is tested to ensure quality (including safety) before the vaccine reaches the public. In addition, FDA regularly inspects places where vaccines are made.\nVaccines are necessary. Your pediatrician believes that your children should receive all recommended childhood vaccines. In the United States vaccines have protected children and continue to protect children from many diseases. However, in many parts of the world many vaccine-preventable diseases that are rarely seen in the United States are still common. Since some vaccine-preventable diseases still occur in the United States and others may be brought into the United States by Americans who travel abroad or from people visiting areas with current disease outbreaks, it's important that your children are vaccinated.\nVaccines are studied. To monitor the safety of vaccines after licensure, the FDA and the CDC created the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). All doctors must report certain side effects of vaccines to VAERS. Parents can also file reports with VAERS. For more information about VAERS, visit www.vaers.hhs.gov or call the toll-free VAERS information line at 800\/822-7967. Other systems exist to further study vaccine safety concerns if they are identified in VAERS by FDA and CDC.\u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00c2\u00a0\nJust as important as the initial vaccinations are the booster shots. These are designed to continue immunity by building on the previous vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 effectiveness. Unfortunately, some parents forget or skip the boosters, which undercut the effectiveness of a very important concept in vaccination: herd immunity. Herd immunity is the benefit everyone receives from a vaccinated population once immunization reaches a critical level. When enough people are vaccinated, everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding those who are too young or too sick to be immunized\u00e2\u20ac\u201dreceives some protection from the spread of diseases. However, relying on herd immunity to keep your child safe is risky. The more parents that follow this way of thinking, the fewer vaccinated children we will have, and the more likely a serious disease will return and infect all of those unvaccinated.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn the rare case that a child has serious side effects to a vaccine, parents can contact the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) at 800\/338-2382 or\u00c2\u00a0www.hrsa.gov\/vaccinecompensation. This federal program was created to help pay for the care of people who have been harmed.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you have any additional\u00c2\u00a0questions or concerns, feel free to ask your pediatrician.\n \t                            The information contained on this Web site should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician.

In 2014, there were 644 cases of measles reported total. That means at this rate, we could expect expect at least double the amount of measles cases in the U.S. for 2015.\nPresident Obama, Governor Chris Christie, and other public officials have all weighed in on the debate with news organizations focusing on the anti-vaxxer movement.\nBut what is the anti-vaxxer movement and what sort of fringe theories do they believe?\nHere are the top 5 conspiracy theories associated with measles and other sorts of vaccines.\nOne main point anti-vaxxers like to bring up is that measles is an ancient disease. It is acknowledged in many ancient manuscripts throughout antiquity.\nMeasles arose in the Middle East and it is first mentioned in text by ancient Egyptians. According to Principles and Practice of Clinical Virology by Arie J. Zuckerman:\nAnti-vaxxers choose to still view measles this way, as another childhood illness similar to chickenpox.\nHowever, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stark contrast between measles and chickenpox as Redditor kgt5003 eloquently explains in a discussion about ancient Egyptians and the measles. They write:\nBut the Measles, as all diseases do, mutated into more deadly strains when people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune systems were fighting it off easily on their own. That is what diseases do. They evolve until they are able to accomplish their aim. The problem with people not being vaccinated for the Measles now is that if enough unvaccinated people get the Measles it will again evolve into a strain that nobody is vaccinated for\/no vaccination exists for which could start a pandemic. Nobody wants Measles, Polio, Diphtheria, etc. to make a comeback. People live much longer, healthier lives now without that shit.\nIt seems unthinkable that we could lose the measles vaccine. Yet we might. Just as bacteria mutate and become resistant to antibiotics, so viruses mutate to outwit a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccine-induced immunity. Both these pharmacological weapons must be used wisely to stop their targets evolving resistance. While there is no sign yet that any measles virus has completely escaped the power of the vaccine, there are growing fears that it may be able to (see \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Monster in the making\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). The faster we get everyone vaccinated, the less likely this is to happen.\nAccording to the WHO, measles \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is one of the leading causes of death among young children even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nMeasles has doomsday capabilities. Chickenpox, on the other hand, only kills about 100 people per year. And there is now a chickenpox vaccine available, too.\nAnti-vaxxers are vocally fearful of their childrens safety, saying that catching the measles is a lot less worse than putting unknown chemicals like the measles vaccine into their bodies.\nFor such arguments they often cite horrible stories from around the globe, like this one reported by The Sydney Morning Herald:\nUsing these stories as fodder for their fears, anti-vaxxers often overlook the political zeitgeist that most of these stories take place in. More so, this tragedy from war torn Syria is the only story one can find about tainted vaccines causing death. A Google search brings up nothing more.\nAnti-vaxxers are notoriously anti-government, fearing that their right to not inoculate their children against preventable diseases will soon be trumped by the federal government.\nSuch opinion columns like that of USA Today columnist Alex Berezow often corroborate their fears. Berezow writes:\nAnti-vaxxers then often turn to the Constitution and their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as being at stake.\nHowever, there are currently no laws being made to penalize anti-vaxxers\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a lot of discussion. An academic article titled Free to Choose but Liable for the Consequences: Should Non- Vaccinators Be Penalized for the Harm They Do? writes:\nWhat do you think should be done? Should there be legal ramifications for anti-vaxxers if admissible in court? Comment below.\nOne of the biggest arguments by the anti-vaccine movement is that vaccines are the cause of the dramatic rise of autism diagnosis for children in the United States.\n The movement picked up media attention when former Playboy Playmate of the Year Jenny McCarthy championed the cause.\nIn recent years the antivaccine movement has focused on the claim that vaccines are linked to neurological injury, and specifically to the neurological disorder autism, now referred to as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However the scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows no correlation between vaccines in general, the MMR vaccine specifically, or thimerosal (a mercury-based preservative) in vaccines with ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders.\nThe primary argument made for an association between thimerosal and ASD is that the rate of diagnosis of ASD has been steadily increasing since the early 1990s. At that time also the routine vaccine schedule was increasing, resulting in an increasing total dose of thimerosal. The antivaccinationists then assume causation from correlation to blame rising ASD rates on thimerosal.\nHowever, by 2002 thimerosal was completely removed from the routine vaccine schedule, and now remains only in some flu vaccines. The total dose of thimerosal exposure is far below 1990 levels, before ASD diagnoses began to rise. Antivaccinationists predicted that ASD rates would fall dramatically in the years following the removal of thimerosal from most vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but rates have continued to rise without even the slightest change in the rate of increase. This is a powerful refutation of the thimerosal-autism hypothesis, and has been replicated in other countries. \nThe rate in increase of autism is probably best attributed to the fact that doctors have gotten better at diagnosing it since it was identified in 1943 by child psychiatrist Leo Kanner.\nThis is one of the more bizarre beliefs that some anti-vaxxers hold.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a fully [twice] vaccinated 22-year-old theater employee in New York City who developed the measles in 2011 was released without hospitalization or quarantine. But like Typhoid Mary, this patient turned out to be unwittingly contagious. Ultimately, she transmitted the measles to four other people, according to a recent report in Clinical Infectious Diseases that tracked symptoms in the 88 people with whom \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Measles Mary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd interacted while she was sick. Surprisingly, two of the secondary patients had been fully vaccinated. And although the other two had no record of receiving the vaccine, they both showed signs of previous measles exposure that should have conferred immunity.\nThere is basis to this story, however. The Oxford Journal writes:\nThis rare occurrence could stem from the fact that people aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting vaccinated and that measles is mutating, as cited in fact one, or that this person simply holds a strange genetic make-up. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too long ago that it was discovered that many Northern Europeans are resistant to HIV.\n","90":"Are you a hepatitis B vaccine non-responder? Approximately 5-15% of people who receive the vaccine are considered non-responders. This is especially important for health care workers, families living in households with people that have HBV, and others who may be at increased risk of exposure to HBV.\u00c2\u00a0 A vaccine non-responder is someone that does not build up an adequate immune response after receiving two, 3-shot series of the HBV vaccine.\u00c2\u00a0 In other words, they complete one series of the HBV vaccine, and follow it with a surface antibody test (HBsAb or Anti-HBs) 4-6 weeks following the last injection of the series.\u00c2\u00a0 If the anti-HBs titre is not greater than 10IU\/l, than the series is repeated, preferably with an HBV vaccine from a different manufacturer, and the person is once again tested for immunity by testing for adequate anti-HBs. (See previous blog, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Got Hepatitis B? Keeping loved ones safe though HBV vaccination\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for details)\nFortunately there are other options for those concerned with being an HBV vaccine non-responder. There is a higher concentration of the HBV vaccine recommended by the CDC that is used for patients undergoing dialysis, and for those that are immune suppressed.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a 40\u00c2\u00b5g\/ml concentration. If it has been one year or less since you completed the three-shot series of the regular concentration of the vaccine, you can try one intramuscular dose of 1.0 ml of the 40\u00c2\u00b5g HBV vaccine.\u00c2\u00a0 If it has been more than one year since your last three shot series of the vaccine, you can repeat the entire three-shot series with the 40\u00c2\u00b5g concentration of the vaccine.\u00c2\u00a0 Follow up with an anti-HBs titre test 4 to 6 weeks following the last injection to ensure it is greater than 10 IU\/l, and that you have adequate immunity.\nIf you continue to remain a non-responder, you can try a series of as many as five intra-dermal injections, given every two weeks, using the 40\u00c2\u00b5g concentration of the HBV vaccine.\u00c2\u00a0 Dose one consists of 0.10 ml of the 40\u00c2\u00b5g\/ml vaccine, followed by the same dose two 2-weeks later.\u00c2\u00a0 At that time an anti-HBs titre test would be drawn to check for immunity.\u00c2\u00a0 If there was not adequate immunity, a third-intra-dermal dose of the vaccine would be given two weeks later.\u00c2\u00a0 Anti-HBs titres would be checked every two weeks and the patient would be given another intra-dermal injection up to a total of 5 intradermal injections of the 40\u00c2\u00b5g concentration of the HBV vaccine. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to ensure that your anti-HBs titre is greater than 10IU\/l.\nPlease note that the schedule for the series might vary depending on the study your doctor chooses to follow.\u00c2\u00a0 However, it is recommended that the higher concentration (40\u00c2\u00b5g) of the hepatitis B vaccine be used for best results.\nMy 20 year old daughter is a Phlebotomist. She was told she was a non- responder when she was tested, vaccinated for her first job at a hospital. Her origional vaccinations as a child were done on scedule with no apparent problems. Her family physician referred her to a  Hemotologist, who referred her to a Infectious disease Dr, who referred her to. Gasterologist, who only deals with patience with Hepatitis. Who would we contact about information on how to protect her and get more information for non- responders and the new intermuscular vaccine?\nThis blog was written with direct input from our senior medical adviser on the described protocol for HBV vaccine non-responders. I assume that she has gone through two rounds of the vaccine without success and has been tested to be sure she does not have a current or even an occult HBV infection. Did she try the higher dose of the 40\u00c2\u00b5g\/ml concentration vaccine? If she continues to be a non-responder, she can try the 40\u00c2\u00b5g\/ml concentration of the vaccine for the intra-dermal vaccine. I would take a copy of this blog to your doctor. If he is unsure, he or you can contact the Hepatitis B Foundation at http:\/\/hepb.convio.net\/site\/PageServer?pagename=contactus, or from the contact button at the top of our website at http:\/\/www.hepb.org. . Thank you!\nI think you mean your anti-HBs or HBsAb is negative and not your HBsAg. It looks like you had an anti-HBs test 1-2 months following the last shot of the series and clearly built up and adequate immune response with a titre of 1420! Over time the immune response may wane and the titre may drop below 10, which is considered an adequate response \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 when checked 1-3 months following the last shot of the series. If you initially generated an adequate response, which you did, then your immune memory will kick in should you be exposed to HBV, thereby once again generating an immune response and protecting you. Hope that makes sense. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about immune memory.\nDr. Thomas London, VP of the HBF board and a member of the board of medical and scientific advisors, says that you may be correct that you are a genetic non-responder, but there is no available information on what the gene or genes might be.  Nevertheless, Dr. London recommends that you try the intradermal injection route. Specifically, 1.0 ml of the concentrated vaccine for dialysis patients is given with a tuberculin syringe into the skin.  Injections are given every 2 weeks with an antibody test done before the next injection.  If you do not respond after 6 injections, then you really are a non-responder.  And of course you should take all precautions to avoid exposure -,gown and mask whenever you might be exposed to a patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blood.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have specific study data. If you feel especially at risk or need to show a generated titre for work or school, then I would certainly consider it. Keep in mind you can also avoid transmission of HBV by taking basic precautions, which includes avoiding direct contact with any blood or body fluid by maintaining a barrier. For example, keep any open cuts covered, and practice safe sex with a latex condom. Always avoid sharing personal items such as razors, toothbrushes, clippers, earrings, piercings, or anything that could have trace amounts of blood on it. Be sure to clean all spilled blood or body fluids with a fresh diluted bleach solution. Take care with piercings and tattoos and be sure all items are single use. Never share drug paraphernalia. These are basic precautions that should be taken to prevent the transmission of other blood borne pathogens for which there are no vaccines available.\nA person is considered a nonresponder if you have gone through 2 complete vaccination series. Here are a couple of options:  Note the higher concentration dose of the virus noted in the blog \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Options for HBV Vaccine Non-Responders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . There is an accelerated travel vaccine schedule given at day 0, Day 7, Day 21 and month 12. Talk to your doctor about trying the first 3 shots of this series with the higher dose concentration. If you do not generate immunity, then talk to your doctor about getting a shot of HBIG right before you leave for your trip.\nDid you receive all 3 shots of the series? If  you are in health care, they often run an anti-HBs titre 1-2 months following the last shot of the HBV vaccine series to ensure the person has generated an adequate titre and is protected. You can ask and see if you had this test. If you had it and know you are protected, then you are all set. If you are unsure, or did not complete the series, then I would get a booster shot of the vaccine. Regardless, I would still ask your doctor for a hepatitis B panel just to be sure. Be sure to wait 4-6 weeks following your exposure.\nSince all of your staff have anti-HBs titres above 10 IU\/mL, this means they have generated adequate immunity and are protected against getting HBV for at least 25 years, which is the current length of on-going studies. Often titres will wane, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean someone isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t protected. If they were exposed, they would mount a fight against an infection. THis is assuming they generated immunity as a result of the vaccine series, since there are non-responders to all vaccines. Typically people do not have their titres checked 1-2 months following the vaccine series. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not required, but if you are at-risk, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly worthwhile. People may worry years later and then have their titres checked. At that point, the titres could wane and you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if they initially generated adequate immunity or if the titres just waned.  If the titres waned and they did not show adequate immunity (<10IU\/mL) then, they would need a booster and they could have titre's checked 1-2 months following the booster. The variations of titres merely reflects each person's unique immune response to the vaccine series. Hope that clarifies it a bit.\nLittle confusion here with your question and test results. Usually when someone is HBeAg neg\/pos the other HBeAb is the opposite, unless they are in the middle of seroconversion. This is certainly possible, so you would want to retest in a few months to see if you are successful in seroconverting. HBcAg is only positive on biopsy rather than serology, so that would be normal. Most people that test HBsAg positive are nearly always also HBcAb positive. Once again, retest to be sure there is no false positive or to confirm results. ultimately the answer answer here is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rested with a reliable lab and liver specialist\nI seem to a non-responder to HBV and other vaccines.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had infections as a child that later tested negative anti-body titers with subsequent vaccinations that years later also show negative anti-body titers.  Rubella, Varicella, Mumps\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.I was vaccinated with HBV in 2003 with a postive ab response and negative ag response (can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get measurement from hospital) but just had titer checks that show non-reactive for ab or ag.  I am an ER nurse and am not thrilled about the prospect of going through a series of a potential 6 vaccinations with HBV only to continue to be a non-resonder since I have a poor track record with vaccines.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve obviously been exposed through the years to many of these infections several times due to my work and raising 2 children.    Can I make a decent supposition that I have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immune memory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and with proper protective equipment and following protocol continue in a safe manner as an ER nurse without more vaccinations?  Or could this kind of history indicate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153genetic non-responder\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  Currently hospitals are requiring several vaccines for employment and termination if not completed unless there are medical contraindications.  Can someone give me a well versed opinion?  Thank You\nA person is considered a non responder after 2 complete series of the vaccine followed by an inadequate titer drawn 1-2 months following the last shot of the series. I know you seem to be a non-responder to some vaccines, but unless you had a titer to confirm your immunity 1-2 months following the last shot of the vaccine series, then I would get a booster shot and test 1 month following the booster with an anti-HBs titer test. If you generate immunity then you do not need to repeat the vaccine series even if your titers wane over time. If you truly are a non-responder then you could try vaccinating with a higher concentration of the vaccine. Most hospitals are requesting proof of titers. Regardless, I would think following proper infection control practices would still be adequate since there are not vaccines for all blood borne pathogens such as HIV and HCV. With any luck you can generate immunity, but if not strict following of infection control practices should be adequate. I would not think being a non responder should keep you from working.\nYou are protected. If you were to be exposed to HBV, you would generate immunity. It is not unusual for the anti-HBs titers to wane over time. The difference is that many do not have their titers checked after they are vaccinated so they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if they ever generated immunity. That is not the case with you since you know you generated immunity since you had a previous titer of 100+. On going studies show that immunity is good for greater than 25 years assuming immunity was generated as a result of the 3 shot vaccine series.\nThe anti-hsb is the antibody to hepatitis B. If you want to be tested for hepatitis B, you want to ask that your HBsAg (surface antigen) is tested. A person is considered immune to hepatitis B if there anti-hbs titer is greater than 10 IU\/mL. Were you vaccinated or do you believe you were exposed? if you ask the doctor to run a hepatitis B panel, it tests for 3 things: HBsAg, HBcAb, HBsAb. When read together it tells you if you have a current infection, if you resolved a past HBV infection or if you have immunity to HBV whether it is from a past infection or through vaccination.\nYour results are a bit unusual. Have you also been tested for hepatitis C? Are you being tested as a result of elevated ALT\/AST and\/or other liver function tests? Please talk to your doctor. Repeat testing and see if the results are the same. Your test indicates that you are positive for hepatitis B, but your core antibody and surface antibody are negative, which is unusual. If you continue to test HBsAg positive, but do not have another infection or problem identified by your doctor and more blood work, then be sure to see a liver specialist to learn more.\nHave you been tested to be sure you are not currently HBV positive? Often when a person is a non responder, it is because the have or had an infection. Is the 2nd vaccine series a made by a different manufacturer than the first series? This is recommended. Another option is to ask for a vaccine of a higher concentration, especially since your partner is HBV positive, if you do in fact not respond. I cannot give you any specific statistics, though there is a percentage of the population that does not respond to the vaccine for whatever reason. I would also try the higher concentration if this series does not work. Also consider Hepislav, which will hopefully soon be on the market. Sci-B-Vac is also a good vaccine, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s available in the U.S.\nI have been employed as a medical secretary in a hospital for 15 years.  Yesterday when I had my TB test, I was on my way out the door when the secretary handed the nurse a printout of some lab work from 2012, the same year I was diagnosed with breast cancer and went through surgery, chemo, and radiation.  He showed me where it said I was nonresponsive to the vaccines I got upon employment.  But, he said, since my job & lifestyle doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involve being in contact with blood or blood products, I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t traveled out of the country in over 10 years, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work closely with patients in countries that have a high level of plague and disease, he would consider me low risk and he left it up to me whether I wanted to try a booster.  I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a vaccine I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need, but I am wondering how safe it is to not have an immunity to Hep B.  Your observation and input would be welcome.  Thank you.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not quite sure what to tell you. it certainly does not sound like you are at risk for HBV with your job as a medical secretary. HBV is not casually transmitted or contagious like TB. Plus the anti-HBs titer test that was likely run in 2012 may not be an accurate reflection of your immunity. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure when you were vaccinated, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not uncommon for the titer to wane with time. Had you been tested 1-2 months following the last shot of the series, you may have found that you generated adequate immunity. Had you proof of immunity, there would be no question. You would not be to get a booster. However, it sounds like you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. If its a concern for you, you could have a booster shot, followed by an anti-HBs titer test 1-2 months following. If you generate adequate immunity then you are protected despite whether or not your titers wane with time. Let me know if you have other questions.\nI am trying to find out the answer to this question. I might be a non responder my surface antibody test is currently less than 10 even though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the series twice over 10 years ago.  I never had the antibody test done right after the series to see if I responded so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if I responded or not. Anyway I was dating someone who reveled to me they have hep B. I think my risk of catching it from her is low because we did not do much but what I want to know is if I am a non responder can non responders immune systems fight off the virus on their own  or does a non response to the vaccine mean a non responder won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond to the real virus  either ?\nA number of variables here. First of course is whether or not you really are a vaccine non-responder. Titers do wane with time, so the timing of the antibody test is very important. Just to be sure, I would get a booster shot of the HBV vaccine and test 1-2 months following the booster shot. Did you have any titer? Also, be sure to look at the definition of a true vaccine non-responder as it is suggested that the person get the second series with a vaccine made by a different manufacturer. \nHello, just got my serology results back and the result was NON-IMMUNE. I have had the infant dose of hepatitis B (3 shots in 1995-6) and follow up of the adult dose of hepatitis B (2 shots in 2007). I was asked to get another dose and then a follow up serology. If i get the dose in a few days time (12th may 2015)  when can I get the serology testing done?  Im worried as I am going on clinical placement in july-sept and need this sorted asap (serology results must be handed back to my unit coordinator at a deadline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a deadline possibly before this semester ends which is end of june) or I may be missing out on clinical placement experience which will set me back a year behind my university course schedule.\nI believe you are saying that your daughter is immunized (completed all 3 shots of the series), but does not show immunity at this time? Did you run the anti-HBs titer test 1-2 months following the last shot of the 2nd series? Did you also try the vaccine from both of the FDA approved vaccine manufacturers?\nI work at a hospital and I recently have been bitten by a patient that broke my skin. I went for lap drawls and today was my second lab draw I was told that I am a nonresponder to the hep B shot and that I needed a booster which I took today. My concern is I did not know that we should have been tested to find out if we are nonresponders after the shots. Is it possible that I was a responder and no longer am?  I took today. My concern is I did not know that we should have been tested to find out if we are nonresponders after the shots. Is it possible that I was a responder and no longer am ? Should I be going through another series of hepatitis B shots? And what should I do after this booster if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still in nonresponder?  ? Should I be going through another series of hepatitis B shots? And what should I do after this booster if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still in nonresponder?  Should I be requesting hepatitis B panel? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not for sure what steps to take next please guide me I go back in October 2015 to see if the booster worked and if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a responder now.\nOuch! Hard to say if you are truly a non-responder at this time. Good that you had a booster. Please ask your doctor to check your anti-HBs titer test in 1-2 months. If you completed the hepatitis B series, it is possible that the titers waned over time. Since you likely did not confirm immunity following the vaccine series, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to know. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see how the titer looks in a month. If you do not generate an adequate titer then you will want to complete this 2nd series .- preferably with a vaccine from a different manufacturer and then retest the titer 1-2 months following the last shot of the series. you can also try a booster with a higher concentration of the vaccine as noted in this article. Should you decide to get test for HBV (via the hepatitis B panel) then be sure you wait a month until after the vaccine. A test for hepatitis B within a month of vaccination can cause a false positive test result.\nHello: I am sorry to hear of your hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Before your immunization, were you ever screened for hepatitis B? Is it possible you were infected during childhood, or are you certain you were recently exposed to hepatitis B blood\/body fluids? If you were just exposed, usually you are given the first shot of the vaccine and one dose of HBIG (hepatitis B antibodies), if it is available. More information on this is available at:\n If you were already infected with hepatitis B before your immunization, then the vaccine would have had no effect.\n As you may know, there are two types of hepatitis B infection, chronic or long-term and short-term or acute. If you test positive for HBsAg for longer than six months, you are considered chronically infected and probably became infected at birth or during childhood. If you were just recently exposed, over several weeks your body should clear the infection (and clear the HBsAg) and develop surface antibodies (HBsAb).\n If it turns out that a second test in six months shows you are still infected, then it will be important for you to see a doctor who is familiar with hepatitis B and get monitored regularly to monitor your infection and health of your liver.\n Also, you should refrain from smoking and drinking and eat healthy food. You should practice universal precautions, as your blood or body fluids can contain the virus, and bandage any cuts or bruises and use safe sex (condoms.) What is vital, is if and when you have children, they must be immunized with the first hepatitis B shot and given one dose of HBIG within 12 hours of birth.\nHello: That is surprising. There are some possibilities, first, a small percentage of people do not respond to the vaccine, so if she was vaccinated perhaps she never generated enough antibodies (titers). Another option is your viral load is low enough that you did not infect her sexually (also surprising.) There are some people who retain an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immune memory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a virus following immunization, even though years later they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t test positive for titers\/antibodies. What that means is her immune system may still remember the virus and protect her, even though there are not lots of antibodies in her system. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if any of those possibilities apply to her.\n What important is that she gets vaccinated immediately, but please talk to your doctor about that. You could use safe sex for the next six months during the time it takes for her to get the three shots, and then retested again. You appear not to have infected her yet, but if you suddenly develop an unrelated illness that weakens your immune system and your viral load rises, you risk infecting her. You are not the only couple I have heard about where infection did not occur! Good luck.\nHello: There is no way to answer your questions with any certainty. It is harder for a male partner to catch hepatitis B from an infected female because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the exposure to blood and body fluids, such as semen, that women do during unprotected sex with men. It also depends on your viral load \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the amount of HBV DNA in your bloodstream. The higher your viral load, the more infectious your body fluids are. Your boyfriend will get his second vaccine shot 30 days after the first one, and then his third shot six months after the first shot. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important he get all three shots.\n About one or two months after his third vaccine, he should return to his doctor and ask to be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies. He will find out if he was infected, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out if the vaccine worked and whether he has enough hepatitis B antibodies to protect him from infection. Good luck.\nHello: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m confused about your son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s test results. If he tests positive for the core antibody (Hep B core Ab) it means he was infected in the past. Is he reactive or positive for the hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb)? If he is, it means he cleared the infection. If he tests positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) it means he is infected with hepatitis B. Sometimes, the vaccine dose that is administered within 12 hours of birth is not effective if the mother has a very high viral load, which means there are lots of virus in her blood and body fluids during delivery. It may be that your son was infected at birth, despite the vaccine, because your viral load was high. Recently, doctors have begun recommending treating pregnant women with high viral loads with antivirals during the last trimester of their pregnancy to lower their viral load and the risk of infecting their baby, in addition to treating the newborn with HBIG (hepatitis B antibodies) and the first dose of the vaccine. I hope this helps, please ask more questions if this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer your question. Thank you.\nHi, I am currently in school for dental hygiene and are required to be vaccinated for Hep B. I did not have my previous shot records from when I was a child so my doctor did the whole titer test and it showed that my immunity was very low so he gave me a booster shot in September and was told to come back in December to re-check. Well on Friday i gave blood again and it still showed no immunity. He gave me my 2nd shot today but thinks that I am not going to build antibodies for hep B. He thinks that I am probably one of the many people out there that do not build antibodies for hep B. My question. Should i still continue pursuing my career as a a dental hygienist and if I do not build immunity against the virus am I at a high risk for contracting hep B?\nHello: There are a small percentage of people whose immune systems do not generate enough hepatitis B surface antibodies following immunization to reach the desired titer (antibody) count of 10 mIU\/mL, which is considered to protect you against hepatitis B infection. The CDC recommends that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-responder\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd repeat the entire three-dose series, which your doctor is having you do, then you can be rechecked to see if you have developed sufficient \u00e2\u20ac\u0153titers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Also, have you been tested for hepatitis B (which includes the hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody) just to see if you were exposed in the past?\n If you do not have immunity, yes you are at risk of hepatitis B, but if you practice universal precautions in your work your risk should be low. Also, many people are immunized against hepatitis B, so it is not as widespread as it was 20 years ago. Talk to your doctor and your school advisors so you are comfortable in your choices. Good luck.\nI have read many of the post here, some similar to my situation. I had my first series during miltary service, approximately 1993. My second came after testing show no titers, in late 04-05, with both of those following the 0-1-6 protocol. After a potential exposure, a third series was done following the same protocol in 07. After a second potential exposure in 2010, I received the double dose of HBIG, as well as another full series of the vaccine. Testing in early 2013 showed continued negative, so I had to go through a fifth round. 6mos testing should good results, 3 year I am back to negative. I am looking to apply for another Healthcare career, and the program is stating I would need to go through again regardless of past history because of the current negative results. As a side note, this is not the only vaccine I have had this kind of response to, as it took three of the pneumo vacs to get a response to 8\/13, and a few other childhood ones had to be redone for my last career change in 2013. I also had to do a chicken pox vaccine even though I had documented chicken pox as a child long before the vaccine was created (I am 44). Most of the info I keep finding tells me to find a specialist, but my Healthcare doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to unless you fight for it. After five go rounds, I honestly doubt whether another series will help considering past. Any recommendations for a possible specialist?\n 3- 2007 booster involved, 4 total doses.\n On the 3rd series, a check was done one month after the second dose, and results were low, so the booster was given before the sixth month dose.\n Fifth series showed good at six month follow up, negative at one year, and again at three years.\nHi, I am in dentistry.  I had a course of 3 injections for Hep B  but did not gain sufficient immunity.  I repeated the course a couple of years later but abreacted to the first 2 injections with muscle spasms that lasted weeks.  The health dept decided not to proceed with the 3rd injection and a blood test showed my titres were just within immune range. 5 years later  I am now due a booster so had a blood test and my titres are too low again.  I am hesitant to proceed with any further vaccines due to the abreactions I experienced previously.  My doctor has no advice for me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can you give me any indication of what I should do?

Adults, especially                   those who fall into a high-risk group, should also seriously                   consider getting the hepatitis B vaccine. \nCommon side effects include soreness, swelling and                     redness at the injection site.

Three doses are generally required to                   complete the hepatitis B vaccine series, although there is                   an accelerated two-dose series for adolescents. \nThe three-shot vaccine series for children in the United States                   usually costs $75 to $165, but this can vary. Infants up to                   age 18 months, and sometimes older children, can receive the                   vaccine free of charge from most local public health clinics. \nInsurance companies will usually cover the cost of                     vaccines for infants and children. There is also                     a federal program to help cover the cost of children's vaccines.                     For more information, contact the Vaccines                     for Children Program. \nThe hepatitis B vaccine costs more for adults. If an adult                   is in a high-risk group, the cost may be also covered by insurance.                   Contact your insurance company for more information about the                   hepatitis B vaccine. \nThere are currently two commercial vaccines used to prevent                   hepatitis B infection among infants, children and adults in                   the United States. They are both manufactured using recombinant                   technology and neither contains blood products. You cannot                   get hepatitis B from these vaccines.

Trump has frequently stated that he believes that vaccines can cause autism, as in the Tweets shown here. In one of the primary debates, he dialed back his criticism a bit, stating, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am totally in favor of vaccines, but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But as Tara Haelle, a blogger at Forbes.com wrote, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccines are very precisely manufactured to include only what is absolutely necessary\u00c2\u00a0to induce enough of an immune response\u00c2\u00a0that the body can protect itself against those diseases. So a smaller dose wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t protect a child. It would stick a child with a needle for no reason at all. And spreading out vaccines? That just\u00c2\u00a0increases the risks\u00c2\u00a0to the children, including leaving them more susceptible to the diseases for a longer period of time. Trump is not \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctotally in favor of vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want children protected from the diseases above as early as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In contrast, in 2015, Hillary Clinton Tweeted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork.

These images remind us of costumed children, scary movies, and tasty treats. But there is a bigger history behind these images, specifically the skeleton. A symbol for death and the afterlife, sometimes positive and sometimes negative, the skeleton holds a powerful meaning across many diverse cultures. It was also once adopted by the 19th-century anti-vaccination movement to scare people, especially parents, into forgoing smallpox vaccination. Below are a few examples of skeletal images used by Victorian Era anti-vaccinators.\nHuman papillomavirus vaccination series completion will now require only two doses of vaccine for adolescents younger than 15 years. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices approved this recommendation at their biannual meeting in Atlanta yesterday. The new schedule for <15 year olds calls for the second dose to be given between 6 and 12 months after the first dose. Adolescents receiving the first dose of HPV vaccine at age 15 or older will continue to be recommended three doses of vaccine, given at 0, 1-2, and 6 months.\nFrequent visitors to this site will probably be acquainted with the name Maurice Hilleman and the man's work. During a long career with the U.S. Army, Squibb, and Merck, Hilleman developed dozens of vaccines and made important innovations in vaccinology. Before Hilleman died in 2005, Paul A. Offit, MD, himself developer of a widely used rotavirus vaccine, filmed a series of interviews with Hilleman and other scientists. Now Dr. Offit has produced and released a\u00c2\u00a0documentary using the footage, and we are proud to host a screening of it. It's an excellent film, with fascinating historical footage,\u00c2\u00a0animations, and insights into the world of infectious diseases prevention. Please join us for the screening -- we think\u00c2\u00a0you'll really enjoy the film.\nThe World Health Organization Region of the Americas has achieved a milestone in disease elimination \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on September 27, 2016, declared the Americas to be free of endemic measles. In the pre-vaccine era, the WHO estimates that measles killed 2.6 million children per year globally, and so measles elimination has done a great deal to combat a major threat to child health.\u00c2\u00a0The Region of the Americas\u00c2\u00a0is the first of the six WHO regions to eliminate transmission of measles. The United States was certified measles-free in 2000, and the last cases of endemic measles were reported in other countries of the region in 2002. The International Expert Committee for Documenting and Verifying Measles, Rubella, and Congenital Rubella Syndrome Elimination in the Americas was responsible for collecting reports from region countries to certify that measles has in fact been eliminated. Polio (certification in 1994), rubella (2015) and smallpox (1971) have been eliminated from the region as well, and, of course, smallpox has been eradicated globally (certification in 1980).\nCarley Roche, an intern here at The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, wrote today's blog post.\u00c2\u00a0In December 1924 the city of Philadelphia experienced an uptick in the incidence of smallpox with 9 new cases of the disease. While there had been a few reported cases earlier in the year, it soon became apparent in early January 1925 that the December outbreak might be more severe than the others, as the first smallpox death occurred in Philadelphia in more than 12 years. The Department of Public Health would spend the next 6 months quarantining and vaccinating citizens of the city in order to prevent a massive outbreak of smallpox beyond the city limits.\nDonald A. Henderson, MD, MPH, died on August 21, 2016, at age 87. Henderson was a crucial figure in the eradication of smallpox. Posted to the World Health Organization in 1966 as a CDC employee, he developed the program that would, just a little more than 10 years later, eradicate a disease that killed more than 30% of those it infected, and that was responsible for hundreds of millions of deaths in the 20th\u00c2\u00a0century alone.\u00c2\u00a0\nHenderson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key insights into smallpox eradication came from his training by Alexander Langmuir as one of the early recruits of the CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Epidemic Intelligence Service, as well as from his public health education at Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health. Though he launched the WHO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s program with the goal of using mass vaccination as the main tool to eradicate smallpox, his use of rigorous surveillance and reporting techniques, learned in these public health contexts, laid the groundwork for a shift in strategy that successfully employed containment, or ring, vaccination to halt the spread of outbreaks.\u00c2\u00a0\nThree years of poor performance of the live nasal spray influenza vaccine (LAIV) have resulted in an unusual policy shift from the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. At their annual meeting yesterday to discuss influenza vaccination recommendations, the\u00c2\u00a0ACIP voted\u00c2\u00a0that the LAIV should not be used in the 2016-2017 influenza season. Data released in May 2016 showed that the LAIV effectiveness was effectively zero as compared with about 60% for the inactivated vaccine, given via injection.\u00c2\u00a0According to the CDC, vaccine effectiveness is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the percent reduction in the frequency of influenza illness among vaccinated people compared to people not vaccinated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd No vaccine effectiveness was observed for the LAIV in children in\u00c2\u00a02013-14 nor in 2014-15. Based on these findings, last year the ACIP voted not to preferentially recommend the LAIV for young children over the inactivated vaccine. (The previous recommendations encouraged use of LAIV in children due to its\u00c2\u00a0assumed better performance\u00c2\u00a0at preventing disease.)\nI've been hosting an internal debate about whether to ignore the\u00c2\u00a0Del Bigtree\/Andrew Wakefield\u00c2\u00a0documentary\u00c2\u00a0Vaxxed\u00c2\u00a0or to see it. On the one hand, the documentary is rehashing a false narrative about the MMR vaccine having a causal role in autism development that has been countered time and again with solid epidemiological evidence. On the other hand, I hate to dismiss something without investigating it more closely for myself. But up until now, the film hasn't been accessible to me and I could ignore it. That was no longer the case beginning this past weekend, when\u00c2\u00a0Vaxxed\u00c2\u00a0began showing for a few days at a local Philadelphia multiplex.\u00c2\u00a0In spite of my trepidation, and at the prodding of one of my colleagues, I went out yesterday to see it in the middle of the afternoon. This being downtown Philly, in the historic district, lots of tourists and museum visitors were walking near the theater. A mother and her two preteen kids were in front of me, across from the marquee prominently advertising that\u00c2\u00a0Vaxxed\u00c2\u00a0was playing. I heard her say to her kids, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe\u00c2\u00a0Vaxxed\u00c2\u00a0is here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this amazing movie that explains how the CDC is hiding evidence that vaccines cause autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rest of her analysis trailed away as they made their way up Walnut Street.\nWe know so little about Zika virus that we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even spell it correctly. Scott C. Weaver, MS, PhD, visiting Philadelphia from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, noted that the forest where Zika virus was discovered in the 1940s is actually spelled\u00c2\u00a0Ziika.\u00c2\u00a0Weaver brought years of research experience to his talk Monday, May 16, at The College of Physicians of Philadelphia. He is an\u00c2\u00a0arbovirus\u00c2\u00a0specialist and has worked extensively on Chikungunya virus, and, even before the current Western Hemisphere Zika virus epidemic, on Zika virus itself.\u00c2\u00a0Given that human cases of Zika virus disease were not known until the 1950s and that 80% of Zika cases present with no symptoms, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know more about the virus and how it works. Before 2007, only 14 human cases had been diagnosed.\u00c2\u00a0Weaver traced the spread of Zika virus across the globe, showing a CDC\u00c2\u00a0map\u00c2\u00a0representing incidence of Zika virus antibodies and infection in local populations throughout many African and Asian countries. The virus almost certainly originated in Africa at least a millennium ago; about 50-100 years ago it spread to Asia. In 2007 the virus jumped to Yap Island from Asia, with a population of about 7,000 people, most of whom became infected. Then, in 2013, it moved to French Polynesia, with more than 100,000 people to potentially infect. French Polynesians then started to transport the virus around the world, probably to Brazil in late 2013. With this move to South America, hundreds of millions of people are now susceptible to infection.\u00c2\u00a0\n","94":"A vaccine is a medical product. Vaccines, though they are designed to protect from disease, can cause side effects, just as any medication can.\nMost side effects from vaccination are mild, such as soreness, swelling, or redness at the injection site. Some vaccines are associated with fever, rash, and achiness. Serious side effects are rare, but may include seizure or life-threatening allergic reaction.\nA possible side effect resulting from a vaccination is known as an adverse event.\nEach year, American babies (1 year old and younger) receive more than 10 million vaccinations. During the first year of life, a significant number of babies suffer serious, life-threatening illnesses and medical events, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Additionally, it is during the first year that congenital conditions may become evident. Therefore, due to chance alone, many babies will experience a medical event in close proximity to a vaccination. This does not mean, though, that the event is in fact related to the immunization. The challenge is to determine when a medical event is directly related to a vaccination.\nThe Food and Drug and Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have set up systems to monitor and analyze reported adverse events and to determine whether they are likely related to vaccination.\nTo understand the range of possible vaccination side effects events, it is useful to compare a vaccine with relatively few associated side effects, such as the vaccine for Haemophilus influenza type B, with a vaccine known to have many potential side effects, such as the infrequently used smallpox vaccine (given to military personnel and others who might be first responders in the event of a bioterror attack).\nHaemophilus influenza type B is a bacterium that can cause serious infections, including meningitis, pneumonia, epiglottitis, and sepsis. The CDC recommends that children receive a series of Hib vaccinations starting when they are two months old.\nSmallpox is a serious infection, fatal In 30% to 40% of cases, and caused by the Variola major or Variola minor virus. No wild smallpox cases have been reported since the 1970s. The World Health Organization has declared it eradicated.\nThe information below about side effects of Hib and smallpox vaccination is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nNo serious side effects have been related to the Hib vaccine.\nFor every million people vaccinated for smallpox, between 14 and 52 could have a life-threatening reaction to smallpox vaccine.\nWhen you or a child gets a vaccine, the health care provider gives you a handout known as the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). The VIS describes common and rare side effects, if any are known, of the vaccine. Your health care provider will probably discuss possible side effects with you. VIS downloads are also available through the CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website.\nPackage inserts produced by the vaccine manufacturer also provide information about adverse events. Additionally, these inserts usually show rates of adverse events in experimental and control groups during pre-market testing of the vaccine.\nThe CDC and FDA established The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System in 1990. The goal of VAERS, according to the CDC, is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to detect possible signals of adverse events associated with vaccines.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (A signal in this case is evidence of a possible adverse event that emerges in the data collected.) About 30,000 events are reported each year to VAERS. Between 10% and 15% of these reports describe serious medical events that result in hospitalization, life-threatening illness, disability, or death.\nVAERS is a voluntary reporting system. Anyone, such as a parent, a health care provider, or friend of the patient, who suspects an association between a vaccination and an adverse event may report that event and information about it to VAERS. The CDC then investigates the event and tries to find out whether the adverse event was in fact caused by the vaccination.\nNot all adverse events reported to VAERS are in fact caused by a vaccination. The two occurrences may be related in time only. And, it is probable that not all adverse events resulting from vaccination are reported to VAERS. The CDC states that many adverse events such as swelling at the injection site are underreported. Serious adverse events, according to the CDC, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are probably more likely to be reported than minor ones, especially when they occur soon after vaccination, even if they may be coincidental and related to other causes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nVAERS has successfully identified several rare adverse events related to vaccination. Among them are\nAdditionally, according to Plotkin et al., VAERS identified a need for further investigation of MMR association with a blood clotting disorder, encephalopathy after MMR, and syncope after immunization (Plotkin SA et al. Vaccines, 5th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders, 2008).\nThe CDC established this system in 1990. The VSD is a collection of linked databases containing information from large medical groups. The linked databases allow officials to gather data about vaccination among the populations served by the medical groups. Researchers can access the data by proposing studies to the CDC and having them approved.\nThe VSD has some drawbacks. For example, few completely unvaccinated children are listed in the database. The medical groups providing information to VSD may have patient populations that are not representative of large populations in general. Additionally, the data come not from randomized, controlled, blinded trials but from actual medical practice. Therefore, it may be difficult to control and evaluate the data.\nRapid Cycle Analysis is a program of the VSD, launched in 2005. It monitors real-time data to compare rates of adverse events in recently vaccinated people with rates among unvaccinated people. The system is used mainly to monitor new vaccines. Among the new vaccines being monitored in Rapid Cycle Analysis are the conjugated meningococcal vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, MMRV vaccine, Tdap vaccine, and the HPV vaccine. Possible associations between adverse events and vaccination are then studied further.\nFor information on systems for compensating individuals who have been harmed by vaccines, see our article on Vaccine Injury Compensation Programs.\n","95":"This is one of the most despicable arguments I've ever heard. First of all, vaccines aren't always 100 percent effective, so it is possible for a vaccinated child to still become infected if exposed to a disease. Worse, there are some people who can't receive vaccinations, because they are immune deficient, or because they are allergic to some component. Those people depend upon herd immunity to protect them. People who choose not to vaccinate their children against infectious diseases are putting not only their own children at risk, but also other people's children.\nI can predict exactly the sort of response I will be getting from the anti-vaccine activists. Because they can't argue effectively against the overwhelming scientific evidence about vaccines, they will say that I work for Big Pharma. (I don't and never have). They will say that I'm not a scientist (I am), and that I'm an \"Agent 666\" (I don't know what that is, but I'm pretty sure that I'm not one).\nWhy are they lying to you? Some are doing it for profit, trying to sell their alternative remedies by making you afraid of science-based medicine. I'm sure that many others within the anti-vaccine movement have genuinely good intentions, and do honestly believe that vaccines are harmful. But as a certain astrophysicist recently said \"The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.\" In the case of vaccine truthers, this is not a good thing. Good intentions will not prevent microbes from infecting and harming people, and the message that vaccines are dangerous is having dire consequences. There are outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses now throughout the United States because of unvaccinated children.\nIn only one respect is my message the same as the anti-vaccine activists: Educate yourself. But while they mean \"Read all these websites that support our position,\" I suggest you should learn what the scientific community says. Learn how the immune system works. Go read about the history of disease before vaccines, and talk to older people who grew up when polio, measles, and other diseases couldn't be prevented. Go read about how vaccines are developed, and how they work. Read about Andrew Wakefield, and how his paper that claimed a link between the MMR vaccine and autism has been withdrawn, and his medical license has been revoked. Read the numerous, huge studies that have explicitly examined whether autism is caused by the vaccine...and found nothing. (While you're at it, read about the ongoing research to determine what IS the cause -- or causes -- of autism, which is not helped by people continuing to insist that vaccines cause it).\nThat may seem like a lot of work, and scientific papers can seem intimidating to read. But reading scientific articles is a skill that can be mastered. Here's a great resource for evaluating medical information on the internet, and I wrote a guide for non-scientists on how to read and understand the scientific literature. You owe it to your children, and to yourself, to thoroughly investigate the issue. Don't rely on what some stranger on the internet says (not even me!). Read the scientific studies that I linked to in this post for yourself, and talk to your pediatricians. Despite what the anti-vaccine community is telling you, you don't need to be afraid of the vaccines. You should instead be afraid of what happens without them.\nHumans try to make sense of the world by seeing patterns. When they see a disease or condition that tends to appear around the time a child is a year or so old, as autism does, and that is also the age that kids get particular shots, they want to put those things together. Parents watch kids more carefully after they get shots. Sometimes they pick up on symptoms then. Just because two things happen at the same time doesn't mean that one caused the other. This is why we need careful scientific studies.\n","96":"Science has provided ample evidence that childhood vaccines are safe and effective, and public health authorities maintain that vaccines are as important as seat belts in protecting our children. Even President Obama has urged parents to have their kids vaccinated.\nSo how can it be that many parents opt against having their children vaccinated--even in the face of the measles outbreak that has sickened more than 102 people in 14 states? \nIt's complicated, of course. Trust in government--or the lack thereof--has been identified as a key factor. But many parents become anti-vaxxers as a result of plain-old misinformation.\nHere are six misguided anti-vaccination arguments--and the truth about each.\nBad argument #1: There's no proof that vaccines don't cause autism. It's hard to prove a negative. But the American Academy of Pediatrics has released a list of more than 40 studies showing no link whatsoever between vaccines and autism.\nBad argument #2: One study from England did show a link between vaccines and autism. Yes, a study published in The Lancet in 1998 did find such a link. But the study was retracted, and the physician-researcher who led it, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, was shown to have falsified the data and was stripped of his medical license.\nBad argument #3: There are lots of anecdotes about children developing autism after being vaccinated. But anecdotes aren't proof, and there's no reason to believe that vaccines caused the children to become autistic. As scientists put it succinctly, correlation simply doesn't imply causation, despite the assumption that many parents make.\nTo point out how misguided this assumption is, Redditor Jasonp55 posted research showing that organic food sales and autism diagnoses increased at the same rate and time. He pointed out that organic food is no more to blame for rising rates of autism than vaccinations are, despite the correlation.\nBad argument #4: It's nobody's business whether my children get vaccinated. Actually, parents who fail to vaccinate their kids may be jeopardizing the health of other children who are unable to get the vaccine because they are too young or for other reasons. When the number of unvaccinated children rises above a certain threshold,  so-called \"herd immunity\" is compromised--and preventable diseases get a toehold in the community. \nBad argument #5: Vaccines can \"overload\" a child's immune system. That's simply not true. From the moment babies are born, they're exposed to all sorts of illness-causing viruses. So most doctors -- and even the CDC and the Institute of Medicine -- agree that a child's immune system can handle the immune-stimulating antigens in multiple vaccines. In fact, as San Francisco-based pediatrician Dr. Laurel Schultz wrote in a recent article, children are exposed to more antigens in the environment every day than to those in all of their vaccinations combined.\nBad argument #6: \"Natural\" immunity is better than the immunity that comes from vaccination. So-called \"natural\" immunity results from the body contracting and successfully battling an infectious illness--and research shows that the immune response of people who have been vaccinated against various diseases is just as good as that of people whose immunity comes from an infection. But of course, vaccine-acquired immunity is preferable because it comes without a potentially dangerous infection.\nSeth Mnookin, HuffPost blogger and author of \"The Panic Virus,\" contributed to this article.\n","97":"Mumps is a viral infection with symptoms including swollen facial glands, fever, headache and pain while swallowing, according to the Mayo Clinic. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easily spread from person to person via infected saliva. Complications are rare, but can result in serious long-term health problems, such as hearing loss and neurological problems.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe United States was on track to eliminate mumps in the early 2000s through vaccination coverage, Hotez explained. But there were multi-state mumps outbreaks in 2006 and in 2009-2010, both of which affected thousands of Americans, particularly teenagers and young adults.\u00c2\u00a0And in 2016, there were more than 5,700 mumps cases, according to the CDC.\nDecreased vaccine coverage is still a major concern in Texas, which saw a 19-fold increase\u00c2\u00a0in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal belief\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conscientious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vaccine exemptions between 2003 and 2010 among school-aged children, according to research Hotez published in the journal Plos Medicine.\nAnd even though the mumps vaccine is less effective than the shot for measles or rubella, people who receive even one dose of the mumps vaccine are less likely to have severe complications if they contract the disease.\n","98":"In January, my daughter celebrated her second birthday. She ran around our apartment with cake on her face and a joyful grin. Pushing around in my wheelchair, I could not catch her, and it hit me again that I cannot run. I cannot even pick her up off the ground if she falls down. I can't do these things because my legs are paralyzed from contracting polio as an infant in India.\nToday, more than any time in history, we are able to save children's lives and prevent disabilities through the use of vaccines. Yet also today, the legitimate use of vaccines in the United States is facing new threats as more and more parents opt out of vaccination requirements, and vaccine opponents promote state laws that make it easier to do so.\nA bill proposed In Idaho would allow parents to opt out of vaccinating their children with a simple letter rather than having to fill out a state or school form. In January 2017, the Rhode Island Senate Health and Human Services committee introduced a bill that would allow parents to exempt their children from required vaccinations based on non-specified personal belief-in addition to the state's existing religious exemption.\nThis threat arises when the percentage of vaccinated children falls below a certain threshold-usually at least 90 or 95 percent. When this happens, disease is able spread more readily through the community, affecting those who are unable to be immunized, such as infants or immune-suppressed children or elderly. Thus, in order to stop the spread of vaccine preventable disease, each community is reliant on actions of its individuals.\nA study by research scientist Dr. Peter Hotez shows the dangerous increase of non-medical exemptions granted in Texas. In 2016, there were almost 45,000 children with non-medical exemptions to immunizations, double the number in 2015. This dropped measles vaccine coverage in communities like Gaines County to below the crucial 95 percent threshold needed to prevent outbreaks. According to Dr. Hotez, in Travis County alone, the exemption rate exceeds 20 percent.\nVaccines play a fundamental role in protecting our lives and those around us from illness and death. They prevent diseases like measles that can cause brain damage, polio that paralyzes, and meningitis that can cause brain damage or even death. According to a study of vaccinated children by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): vaccine use in America between 1994 and 2013 has saved 732,000 lives (greater than the population of Boston), avoided 21 million hospitalizations and 322 million illnesses (more than the current population of the entire country).\nIt is easy to take vaccine protection for granted. They have been so effective in eliminating disease that many people are unaware of the extent of suffering they once inflicted. The U.S. polio epidemic in the 1940s and 1950s left tens of thousands of people paralyzed. Prior to measles vaccination in the early 1960s, there were an estimated 50,000 hospitalizations, 4,000 cases of permanent brain damage, and 500 deaths from measles every year.\nAs a parent who understands the value of vaccines personally, I urge other parents, health care providers and state legislators to join together to support childhood vaccination programs. We must ask our state legislatures to vote against bills that would soften existing requirements or allow for more vaccination exemptions. We can go further to ask our leaders to consider tightening exemption policies altogether. Let us send the message that we value children's lives and the vaccines that help to keep our country safe from preventable diseases.\n","99":"Blood vessels supplying the brain with blood (intracranial vasculitis), and\nBrain (encephalitis)\nCerebellar ataxia is more commonly seen in children, usually developing a week after the rash appears. The child experiences uncoordinated movements that gradually improve over 1-2 weeks and resolve without any lasting impairment.\nPneumonia is more likely to occur as a complication in adults, particularly pregnant women during the last trimester of pregnancy.\u00c2\u00a0 Around one in 10 people with chickenpox related pneumonia need to be hospitalised.\nMaternal chickenpox during pregnancy can infect the fetus. The highest risk period is during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy when up to two in 100 infants exposed to chickenpox before birth will be born with congenital varicella syndrome. Characteristics of congenital varicella syndrome include skin scarring, eye, limb and brain abnormalities, cataracts, developmental delay and early death.\nMaternal chickenpox within five days before and two days after delivery can infect the newly born infants. Up to 30 in 100 new-borns with chickenpox develop severe disease that can result in death.\nReye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Syndrome can occur after a viral infection in children, including chickenpox. It is more likely to occur when children are given aspirin or a medicine with an ingredient name including the words salicylate or salicytic acid. These medicines MUST NOT be given to children with chickenpox or any other viral illness.\nHerpes zoster (shingles) is due to reactivation of latent varicella virus infection. This consists of a dermatomally distributed vesicular rash. The majority of cases of zoster occur in adults over 50 years of age and in immune-suppressed individuals.\u00c2\u00a0Ophthalmic herpes zoster may cause permanent loss of vision.\nMethod of transmission\nChickenpox can occur all year round but is most common during winter and spring.\nThe virus can be transferred from person to person through droplets of saliva in the air from people coughing, sneezing or laughing. It can also be transferred by direct contact with the liquid from the rash blisters.\nA person with chickenpox can pass the virus on for 1-2 days before they get the rash until after the rash blisters have dried up, which usually takes 5-7 days. It is possible for a person with shingles to pass the virus on to a person not immune to chickenpox but only by direct contact with the rash blisters.\nIn countries where chickenpox is common few people avoid ever having the disease because more than 85% of people susceptible to chickenpox will become infected after exposure to the virus.\nPublic health significance\nAn estimated 90% of all children are infected with varicella before they reach adolescence.\nAdults, adolescents and those with immune-suppression are more likely to experience serious disease.\nVaricella is highly infectious, from up to\u00c2\u00a0two days before appearance of the rash until blisters have crusted (usually about 5-7 days after the appearance of the rash). If one person has varicella, about 85% of their close contacts will get it too, unless they have had the disease or the relevant vaccine.\nThe risks of severe complications from super infection with group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, (including cellulitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, necrotising fasciitis and post-infectious glomerulonephritis), is of concern due to the continued resurgence of highly virulent strains of Streptococcus pyogenes since the early 1980s, particularly in countries with developed economies.\nBabies born to women who contract varicella in the first\u00c2\u00a0two trimesters of pregnancy have a 0.4-2% chance of congenital varicella syndrome.\nBabies whose mother has onset of chicken pox from\u00c2\u00a0five days before until two days after delivery have a 17-30% of developing severe disease.\nThe elderly and the immune-compromised may develop herpes zoster due to reactivation of latent varicella virus. There is a 50% chance of developing shingles between the ages of 50 and 65 in the USA.\nNew Zealand epidemiology\nIn New Zealand it is expected that 90 percent of children would have had varicella infection before adolescence, with peak incidence in the five to nine years age group. With higher participation rates in preschool education, a greater proportion of infections may now be occurring in preschool aged children.\nOnly\u00c2\u00a0four percent of hospitalisations involved people with an underlying disease associated with immune suppression. The rate of hospital discharges for the zero to four and five to nine years age groups was higher compared with older age groups because the disease is most common in childhood. However, adults, adolescents and infants are more likely to suffer severe illness or the complications of varicella.\nBased on overseas rates, it is estimated that up to one case of congenital varicella syndrome may be expected in New Zealand each year, although few have been reported.\nMortality data are available for the period 1980 to 2002. Nine deaths were attributed to varicella over the 14-year period 1980 to 1993, of which four occurred in children, two in infants and three in adolescents or adults. None of the cases who died had a contributory cause of death recorded. From 1994 to 2002 there were also nine deaths associated with varicella, two were children aged five to nine years, four were adults aged 30 to 64 years and three were adults over the age of 65 years.\nLarger series from other developed temperate climate countries suggest that up to 10 percent of varicella deaths may involve individuals with immune suppression.\nIn summary, in a typical year New Zealand is estimated to experience approximately 50,000 varicella infections, of which 150\u00e2\u20ac\u201c200 result in hospitalisation, one to two cases result in residual long term disability or death, and 0.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 cases result in severe congenital varicella syndrome. About two-thirds of this burden is borne by otherwise healthy children, and less than one-tenth by children with a disease associated with immune suppression.\nPrevention\nChildren with chickenpox are advised not to attend early childhood services, school or public places for at least one week from the appearance of the rash\u00c2\u00a0 until all the blisters are dry and crusted. Adults are advised not to attend work or public places for the same period of time.\nHigh risk contacts should also be excluded from early childhood services and school during the duration of an outbreak.\nVarilrix\u00c2\u00ae and Varivax\u00c2\u00ae are the two chickenpox vaccine brands available for private purchase through your nurse or doctor. Both contain live weakened Oka strain varicella zoster virus. The combination measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine is not available in New Zealand at this time.\nThe herpes zoster vaccine Zostavax\u00c2\u00ae is licensed for adults 50 years of age and over for the prevention of shingles.\nChickenpox vaccine can be given from nine months of age ideally before but also if necessary after exposure to the disease. Studies have shown that giving the vaccine to children 12 years or younger within 72-96 hours of exposure to chickenpox can prevent the disease developing or reduce the severity of the disease. The vaccine can also be given to older children and adults after exposure to chickenpox. However, a single dose after exposure in this age group may not prevent or reduce the severity of disease. Receiving the vaccine after exposure to the disease will not make the disease more severe at any age.\nAll new born newborn infants exposed to chickenpox around the time of delivery, hospitalised infants born before 28 weeks of pregnancy or with a birth weight less than 1000 grams, and children and adults with weakened immune systems and no reliable history of chickenpox should receive zoster immunoglobulin, a human blood product that provides protection against the disease, as soon as possible after and within 96 hours of exposure to the disease.\nPregnant women with no reliable history of chickenpox should have an urgent blood test to check for immunity after exposure to chickenpox. If the blood test suggests no immunity against chickenpox, they can receive zoster immunoglobulin within 96 hours of exposure, or wait for the onset of symptoms and begin antiviral medicine immediately.\nContact can be defined as:\nHousehold contact \u00e2\u20ac\u201c individuals living in the same house are very likely to be infected if susceptible.\nPlay mate contact \u00e2\u20ac\u201c defined as more than one hour of play indoors with an infected individual.\nNewborn infant contact \u00e2\u20ac\u201c occurs when the mother of a newborn infant develops chicken pox, but not shingles, from one week before to one week after delivery.\nPost-exposure prophylaxis with Zoster Immune Globulin (ZIG)\nThe recommended ZIG concentration is 100 U\/mL with the volume of dose administered determined by the age of the recipient:\nAdults - 6mL\nChildren aged 6-12 years - 4mL\nChildren aged 0-5 years -\u00c2\u00a02mL\nHuman normal\u00c2\u00a0IG is indicated when ZIG is unavailable\nTreatment\nReducing pain, discomfort and itching associated with the blisters, preventing dehydration and skin infection and providing early antibiotic medicine when skin infection occurs are the main treatment measures for healthy children.\nFor healthy adolescents and adults, the use of antiviral medicine should be considered in addition to comfort measures. Antiviral medicine started within 24 hours of the rash appearing may reduce the severity of the disease.\nTips for managing chickenpox symptoms\nDrink plenty of water.\nTrim nails short and consider using mittens or clean socks, to decrease the risk of scratching, especially overnight.\nHave a cool or lukewarm bath every 3-4 hours. Do not use soap. Try adding oatmeal, baking soda or moisturising bath lotion to the bath water. Pat dry, do not rub, after bathing.\nMoisturise with non-irritating skin lotion. Calamine lotion is not recommended.\nDress in loose fitting clothing and change the bed linen daily.\nWhen blisters in the mouth and throat affect drinking and eating, offer clear cool drinks and soft bland foods and avoid acidic drinks such as fruit juices.\nUse paracetamol to relieve discomfort and pain.\nIf itching is severe, ask your doctor about anti-itching medicine in liquid or tablet form.\nAspirin or any medicine with an ingredient name including the words \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsalicylate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsalicytic acid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 MUST NOT be given to children with chickenpox because of the risk Reye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Syndrome.\nVarilrix\u00c2\u00ae\nVaricella\nVarilrix\u00c2\u00ae is used for primary vaccination of infants from\u00c2\u00a0nine months of age, children and adults to protect against varicella-zoster infection (chickenpox). The vaccine may prevent or reduce the severity of chickenpox disease if it is given within 3-5 days of exposure to someone with the disease.\n","100":"PDF printable version of 4.5 Hepatitis B of the 10th edition of the Handbook (PDF 530 KB)\nThis chapter has been amended on July 2016.\n4.5.1 Virology\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) contains circular, partially double-stranded DNA. The outer surface of the virus is glycolipid, which contains the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Other important antigenic components are the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). HBcAg is not detectable in serum, but can be detected in liver tissue in persons with acute or chronic hepatitis B infection. HBeAg, and antibodies against HBeAg (anti-HBe) or the HBcAg (anti-HBc), are serological markers of HBV infection. Antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs) indicate immunity, which may result from either natural infection or immunisation (in which case there would not be any markers of HBV infection). Persistence of HBsAg denotes infectivity, which is greater if HBeAg and\/or HBV DNA are also positive.1 Occult hepatitis B infection is characterised by the presence of HBV DNA in the liver (with or without detectable HBV DNA in the serum) and negative HBsAg.2 \n4.5.2 Clinical features\nIn approximately 30 to 50% of adults, infection causes symptomatic acute hepatitis, but in neonates and young children, particularly those <1 year of age, initial infection is usually asymptomatic.3,4 The incubation period is usually 45 to 180 days and the period of communicability extends from several weeks before the onset of acute illness usually to the end of the period of acute illness. Acute illness is clinically indistinguishable from other forms of hepatitis, and symptoms include fever, jaundice, malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain (especially in the right upper quadrant), myalgia, and the passage of dark-coloured urine and light-coloured stools. Jaundice may be preceded by an acute febrile illness with arthralgia or arthritis and rash, most typical of hepatitis B. During recovery, malaise and fatigue may persist for many weeks. Fulminant hepatitis occurs in up to 1% of acute cases.1,5\nFollowing acute infection, approximately 1 to 10% of persons infected in adulthood,4,6 but up to 90% of those infected in early infancy,6 become chronically infected with hepatitis B. Persons chronically infected with HBV are identified by the long-term presence (longer than 6 months) of circulating HBsAg.1,5 Those with occult infection may reactivate HBV infection if they become immunocompromised.\nPersons with chronic HBV infection are capable of transmitting the disease, including mother-to-child peripartum transmission, though they often remain asymptomatic and may not be aware that they are infected. Most of the serious complications associated with hepatitis B occur in the context of chronic HBV infection, which is associated in up to 25% of cases with premature mortality due to cirrhosis and\/or hepatocellular carcinoma.1\n4.5.3 Epidemiology\nThe prevalence of chronic HBV infection differs in different parts of the world, and may be quite variable within countries. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection varies from less than 0.5% among Caucasians in the United States, northern Europe and Australia, 1 to 5% in the Mediterranean countries, parts of eastern Europe, Africa, Central and South America, up to greater than 10% in many sub-Saharan African, East and Southeast Asian and Pacific island populations.7-10 In regions of moderate to high prevalence of HBsAg (where \u00e2\u2030\u00a52% of the population is HBsAg-positive), infections are mainly acquired perinatally or in early childhood.1 \nChronic infection and its sequelae, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, contribute to the majority of HBV disease burden in Australia. In recent decades, the burden from such disease has been increasing, concurrent with the increasing number of immigrants from regions of high HBV prevalence.11 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and migrants born in Asia and Pacific islands, North Africa, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean countries, have a significantly increased prevalence of chronic HBV infection compared with the rest of the Australian-born population.12,13 First-generation immigrants of culturally and linguistically diverse background, who are mostly from countries of high HBV endemicity, usually retain the prevalence of chronic HBV infection of their country of origin. Other population groups with an increased prevalence of markers of HBV infection include patients with HIV infection, persons who used injected drugs between 1980 and 1990, and household contacts of someone diagnosed with hepatitis between 1980 and 1990.13 Notification of chronic HBV infection depends on levels of hepatitis B testing and reporting, and a substantial proportion of persons with chronic HBV infection remain undiagnosed. It has been estimated by mathematical modelling that, in 2010, about 170 000 people were living with HBV infection in Australia, with about 335 deaths due to HBV infection in that year.14\nNewly acquired cases of HBV infection in Australia mostly occur in young adults, through injecting drug use, skin penetration procedures or sexual contact.15 Between 2006 and 2010, the notification rate of newly acquired hepatitis B in Australia ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 per 100 000 population. Since 2001, the rate of diagnosis of newly acquired infections has declined substantially among people aged 15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c29 years and has remained relatively stable among people aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a530 years.14-16 However, some new HBV infections are asymptomatic and may go undetected. \nSimilar to chronic infection, higher rates of notified cases of newly acquired hepatitis B, or hospitalisation due to acute hepatitis B, have been reported among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people compared with the general Australian population.17,18 In one United States study, adults with diabetes mellitus had a greater chance of developing acute hepatitis B disease than the general population;19 however, there are no published Australian studies examining this.\nTransmission of HBV may result from inoculation through broken or penetrated skin, or by mucosal contact with blood or other body fluids (mainly vaginal fluids and semen) from an infectious person. There are four major routes of HBV transmission:\nIn Australia, screening of blood and organ donors using serological, and subsequently nucleic acid amplification testing, has virtually eliminated the risk of transmission of hepatitis B through blood transfusion and organ transplants.20,21 Saliva may contain levels of virus that are likely to be infective only if inoculated directly into tissue (ocular or mucous membranes). The risk of transmission by inadvertent inoculation by other means, such as by toothbrush, razor etc., or through close personal contact in households in which one or more infected persons reside, is low but not negligible.22-29\nThe strategy for prevention of hepatitis B through immunisation in Australia commenced in the early 1980s, with vaccination programs targeting individuals with increased risk of HBV exposure, including infants at particular risk of infection at birth. Universal infant vaccination commenced in the Northern Territory in 1990. A universal hepatitis B vaccination program was recommended for infants and adolescents in 1996. The adolescent program commenced in some states and territories in 1997 and the universal infant program, which includes a dose given at birth, began nationally in 2000. The adolescent program will continue until those immunised for hepatitis B in the infant program reach adolescence.\n4.5.4 Vaccines\nHepatitis B vaccines are prepared using recombinant technology. After purification, the HBsAg protein is adsorbed onto elemental aluminium (as hydroxide and\/or phosphate). Hepatitis B vaccines may contain up to 1% yeast proteins (but no yeast DNA). \nThe Engerix-B and the H-B-Vax II vaccines are manufactured by different processes, and the HBsAg content of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcequivalent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 doses of these two vaccines is different.  the HBsAg content of the paediatric formulations of these two vaccines is half that of the corresponding manufacturer's adult formulation. Studies of hepatitis B vaccines have been conducted using different schedules and intervals for different age groups. Acceptable schedules are shown in Table 4.5.1 and are described below.\nThe standard 3-dose schedule and variations\nNeonates, children and young adults aged <20 years\nThe recommended Australian infant schedule consists of a dose of monovalent hepatitis B vaccine given at birth, followed by 3 doses of a hepatitis B-containing combination vaccine, given at 2, 4 and 6 months of age (refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcInfants and young children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd4.5.7\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdRecommendations\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdbelow). If an infant did not receive the birth dose within the 1st 7 days of life, catch-up of that dose is not necessary. Such infants then only  require 3 doses of a hepatitis B-containing vaccine, given at 2, 4 and 6 months of age.\nA 3-dose schedule at birth, 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 months and 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 months of age has been  shown to be equally as immunogenic as the recommended Australian schedule above; such schedules are often used overseas.30-32 Children born overseas who have received hepatitis B vaccine in such a 3-dose schedule can also be considered to have completed the primary vaccination course.\nFor infants, the final dose of the primary hepatitis B vaccine course should preferably be  administered at \u00e2\u2030\u00a524 weeks of age. However, if the final dose is given at <24 weeks but \u00e2\u2030\u00a516 weeks of age, it is not necessary to repeat the dose, provided  the minimum intervals between doses in Table 2.1.7 (in 2.1.5\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdCatch-up.) have been met.\nFor older children and young adults aged <20 years (who have not received hepatitis B vaccination earlier in life) a 3-dose schedule of the paediatric formulation (0.5 mL) of monovalent hepatitis B vaccine can be used (at times 0, 1 and 6 months), as per Table 4.5.1. Immunogenicity studies suggest there can be some flexibility of the vaccination schedule intervals for  monovalent hepatitis B vaccines. The use of longer time intervals  between doses does not impair the immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccine.33,34 The minimum interval between the 1st and 3rd doses of a 3-dose primary schedule is 4 months. This means that a shortened 3-dose schedule provided at either 0, 1, 4 months or 0, 2, 4 months is acceptable.35 More compressed 3-dose schedules (e.g. 0, 1, 3 months) are not recommended. Such compressed schedules are associated with lower peak levels of anti-HBs antibody,36,37 and hence likely shorter duration of antibody persistence (at levels \u00e2\u2030\u00a510 mIU\/mL),38 although the clinical significance of this is uncertain.39 (Refer also to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAdults aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a520 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 below.)\nAdults aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a520 years\nFor adults, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine adult formulation (1.0 mL) is given in a 3-dose schedule at times 0, 1 and 6 months (refer to Table 4.5.1). There is some flexibility regarding the interval between the doses. The proportion of vaccine recipients attaining a seroprotective anti-HBs antibody level (\u00e2\u2030\u00a510 mIU\/mL), generally measured 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 months after vaccination, is comparable between adults who received their 3rd dose at 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 months after the 1st dose and those who received their 3rd dose 6 months or more after the 1st dose.40 Increasing the interval between the 1st and 2nd doses has little effect on the final antibody level attained, but a longer interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses is associated with a higher final antibody level.37, 41, 42 However, for those who may be exposed to hepatitis B, delaying the 3rd dose may increase the risk of acquiring HBV infection.\nFor a shortened 3-dose schedule to attain comparable antibody levels to the standard 3-dose schedule, all three of the following minimum interval requirements must be satisfied: \nThat is, either a 0, 1, 4 month or a 0, 2, 4 month interval schedule is an acceptable 3-dose schedule for adults.43\nThe minimum intervals outlined above should be met where possible. More compressed 3-dose schedules (e.g. 0, 1, 3 months) are not recommended. If a compressed 3-dose schedule that does not meet these minimum intervals has already been administered, it may not be necessary to repeat a dose. Although compressed schedules are associated with lower peak antibody levels41 and hence likely shorter duration of antibody levels \u00e2\u2030\u00a510 mIU\/mL,38 the significance of this is unclear. The majority of individuals in whom anti-HBs becomes undetectable have been shown to mount an anamnestic response to an additional vaccine dose, which indicates they are likely to be protected if exposed to hepatitis B virus.39\nNote that the interval between the 1st and 3rd doses has been shortened to less than 4 months in studies of 4-dose accelerated schedules, with the aim to achieve a higher seroprotective antibody level sooner. However, as antibody levels are substantially lower after 3 accelerated doses than after the standard 3-dose schedule,42 a 4th dose is required to achieve comparable antibody levels to the standard 3-dose schedule (refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAccelerated schedules\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 below).\nThe standard 3-dose schedule induces protective levels of neutralising antibody against hepatitis B virus in more than 90% of adults. The frequency of seroconversion increases progressively from approximately 35% after the 1st dose to more than 90% after the 3rd dose. There is evidence of immunity in most vaccine recipients after administration of 2 doses of a 3-dose schedule. However, the 3rd dose is necessary to increase the percentage of responders and to provide long-term protection.\nAlternative 2-dose schedule for adolescents\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that adolescents 11\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 years of age who receive 2 doses of adult formulation monovalent hepatitis B vaccine 4 to 6 months apart develop similar protective antibody levels to those vaccinated using paediatric formulations in the standard 3-dose schedule.44-46\nUsing a 2-dose schedule for the 11\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 years age group may improve compliance and will provide comparable immunogenicity to that of a 3-dose paediatric schedule. Adolescents (11\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 years of age) can be vaccinated with the adult formulation of either H-B-Vax II or Engerix-B in a 2-dose schedule (refer to Table 4.5.1).\n*\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdFor minimum intervals, refer to text above.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a0 In these schedules, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcday 0\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dose refers to the day when the 1st dose is given (i.e. day 0 of the vaccination course), not the age of the recipient. For infant  vaccination, where the 1st dose is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbirth dose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it is indicated as so.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a1\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdThe final dose of the primary course for infants should preferably be  given at \u00e2\u2030\u00a524 weeks of age ; however, if given at <24 weeks but \u00e2\u2030\u00a516 weeks of age, it is not necessary to repeat the dose, provided the minimum intervals between doses have been met (refer to Table 2.1.7 in 2.1.5 Catch-up).\n \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd The 2 month dose can be given as early as 6 weeks  of age. \n \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdThis schedule should  not be used for those who require prompt protection against hepatitis B, for example, if there is close contact with a person known to be chronically infected with hepatitis B.\nAccelerated schedules\nEngerix-B (monovalent hepatitis B vaccine, paediatric and adult) and Twinrix (720\/20) (combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccine) are also registered for use in accelerated schedules, which consist of 4 doses in total (refer to Table 4.5.2 below). Accelerated schedules result in a high proportion of vaccine recipients attaining a seroprotective anti-HBs antibody level (\u00e2\u2030\u00a510 mIU\/mL) in the early months following commencement of the schedule. However, multiple studies have consistently shown that antibody levels are substantially lower at month 7, after 3 accelerated doses, than after the standard 3-dose schedule (0, 1, 6 months).42 Also, some studies, in particular among persons who inject drugs and\/or inmates of correctional facilities, have shown a lower proportion of subjects attaining the seroprotective antibody level after 3 doses of an accelerated schedule than after the standard 3-dose schedule.42,47,48 After the 4th dose of an accelerated schedule, administered at 12 months, anti-HBs antibody levels are higher or comparable to those after a standard 3-dose schedule. Hence, a 4th dose should be administered at 12 months to complete an accelerated schedule.\nAccelerated schedules should only be used for those persons with an imminent risk of exposure, such as those intending to travel to hepatitis B endemic areas with a very limited time before departure. As higher seroprotective rates after the 3rd dose of an accelerated 4-dose schedule are seen after the 0, 1, 2, 12 months schedule than after the 0, 7, 21 days, 12 months schedule, it is recommended that the latter schedule only be used in exceptional circumstances.\nCombination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccine schedules\nThe schedules for combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccines are shown in Table 4.5.1 (and 4.4 Hepatitis A). Three-dose schedules for adults and children aged <16 years are acceptable; however, a 2-dose schedule in children 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 years of age, using Twinrix (720\/20), also results in protective antibody levels for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B. An accelerated schedule for combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccine in those aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a516 years is shown in Table 4.5.2. above. The appropriate use of accelerated schedules is discussed above.\nThe use of mixed vaccine schedules using both the combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccine and monovalent hepatitis B vaccines is not routinely recommended. Generally, use of the same brand of vaccine is recommended. (Refer also to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcInterchangeability of hepatitis B vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in 4.5.6 Dosage and administration below.)\n4.5.5 Transport, storage and handling\nTransport according to National vaccine storage guidelines: Strive for 5.46 Store at +2\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdC to +8\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdC. Do not freeze.\nInfanrix hexa must be reconstituted by adding the entire contents of the syringe to the vial and shaking until the pellet is completely dissolved. Reconstituted vaccine should be used as soon as practicable. If storage is necessary, hold at room temperature for not more than 8 hours.\n4.5.6 Dosage and administration\nThe schedules for hepatitis B vaccines and for combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccines are shown in Table 4.5.1 and 4.5.2. For combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccines, refer also to 4.4  Hepatitis A.\nThe dose of Engerix-B and H-B-Vax II (paediatric formulations) and Twinrix Junior (360\/10) is 0.5 mL, to be given by IM injection.\nThe dose of Engerix-B and H-B-Vax II (adult formulations) and Twinrix (720\/20) is 1.0 mL, to be given by IM injection. \nThe dose of Infanrix hexa is 0.5 mL, to be given by IM injection.\nHepatitis B and combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccines can generally be co-administered simultaneously with, or at any time before or after, all other vaccines. \nInterchangeability of hepatitis B vaccines\nThe Engerix-B and H-B-Vax II vaccines are manufactured by different processes, and the HBsAg content of an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcequivalent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dose is different. Although switching of vaccine brands is not recommended, in cases where the brand of vaccine used for previous doses is not known, another age-appropriate \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcequivalent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dose brand (refer to Table 4.5.1) may be used. For example, a study in healthy neonates demonstrated comparable high levels of immunogenicity between two different mixed regimens that used two monovalent hepatitis B vaccines from different manufacturers.50 As there is only one brand of combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccine, interchangeability is not relevant. (Refer also to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCombination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccine schedules\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in 4.5.4 Vaccines above.) \n4.5.7 Recommendations\nInfants and young children\nThe recommended hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants from birth is shown in Table 4.5.1. A birth dose of monovalent paediatric formulation hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all newborn infants. Following this birth dose, 3 doses of a hepatitis-B-containing vaccine (usually provided as DTPa-hepB-IPV-Hib) are recommended for all children, at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Thus, a total of 4 doses of hepatitis B vaccine are provided in the 1st year of life. The 1st dose of a hepatitis B-containing vaccine can be given as early as 6 weeks of age. If the 1st dose is given at 6 weeks of age, the next scheduled doses should still be given at 4 months and 6 months of age. \nIf an infant has not received a birth dose within the 1st 7 days of life, a primary 3-dose course of a hepatitis B-containing combination vaccine should be given, at 2, 4 and 6 months of age; catch-up of the birth dose is not necessary.\nThe rationale for recommending the birth dose for all newborn infants is not only to prevent vertical transmission from a mother with chronic hepatitis B infection (recognising that there may be errors or delays in maternal testing, reporting, communication or appropriate response), but also to prevent horizontal transmission to the infant in the first months of life from persons with chronic hepatitis B infection who are household or other close contacts.48 The birth dose should be given as soon as the baby is medically stable, and preferably within 24 hours of birth. Every effort should be made to administer the vaccine before discharge from the obstetric hospital or delivery unit. All newborns of mothers known to have chronic hepatitis B infection must be given a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) (refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcManagement of infants born to mothers who are HBsAg-positive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 below).\nAlthough it is not routinely recommended in Australia, infants or toddlers who have received a 3-dose schedule of hepatitis B vaccine (often given overseas) with doses at birth, 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 months of age and \u00e2\u2030\u00a56 months of age can also be considered fully vaccinated (refer to 4.5.4  Vaccines, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe standard 3-dose schedule and variations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 above).\nThe final dose of the primary hepatitis B vaccine course in infants should preferably be  administered at \u00e2\u2030\u00a524 weeks of age. However, if the final dose is given at <24 weeks but \u00e2\u2030\u00a516 weeks of age, it is not necessary to repeat the dose, provided the minimum intervals between doses in Table 2.1.7 (in 2.1.5\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdCatch-up.) have been met.\nManagement of infants born to mothers who are HBsAg-positive\nRoutine antenatal screening of pregnant women for HBsAg is recommended to enable appropriate management to prevent newborn infants developing HBV infection (refer to 4.5.2 Clinical features and 4.5.3 Epidemiology above).52-54 It also enables appropriate follow-up and management of mothers who have chronic HBV infection, identification of the HBV immune status of other household members, and protection of those who are susceptible to HBV infection. \nInfants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should be given HBIG and a dose of monovalent hepatitis B vaccine on the day of birth, concurrently but in separate thighs. The dose of HBIG is 100 IU, to be given by IM injection. It is preferable to administer HBIG immediately after birth (preferably within 12 hours of birth and certainly within 48 hours) as its efficacy decreases markedly if given more than 48 hours after birth.\nThe dose of monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be given to the infant preferably within 24 hours of birth, and definitely within 7 days. This regimen results in seroconversion rates of more than 90% in neonates, even with concurrent administration of HBIG. Vaccination should not be delayed beyond 7 days after birth, as vaccination alone has been shown to be reasonably effective in preventing infection, provided it is given early.52 Three subsequent doses of a hepatitis B-containing vaccine should be given, at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, so that the infant receives a total of 4 doses of hepatitis B-containing vaccines.\nAnti-HBs antibody and HBsAg levels should be measured in infants born to mothers with chronic hepatitis B infection 3 to 12 months after completing the primary vaccine course. Testing should not be performed before 9 months of age to avoid detection of anti-HBs antibodies from HBIG given at birth. If anti-HBs antibody levels are adequate (\u00e2\u2030\u00a510 mIU\/mL) and HBsAg is negative, then the infant is considered to be protected35 (refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSerological testing following hepatitis B vaccination\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 below). If the anti-HBs level is <10 mIU\/mL, expert advice regarding revaccination and\/or further testing should be sought.\nPreterm and low-birth-weight infants\nLow-birth-weight preterm newborn infants do not respond as well to hepatitis B-containing vaccines as full-term infants.56-58 Thus, for low-birth-weight infants (<2000 g) and\/or infants born at <32 weeks gestation (irrespective of weight), it is recommended to give the vaccine in a 4-dose schedule at 0 (birth), 2, 4 and 6 months of age, followed by either:\nHIV-positive and immunocompromised children\nAll HIV-positive and immunocompromised children should be age-appropriately vaccinated against hepatitis B.\nHIV-positive children should receive 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine using an adult formulation (i.e. double the standard recommended dose for children). In a limited number of studies, paediatric haemodialysis patients have demonstrated improved response when given higher doses in a 3-dose schedule.59,60\nFor specific hepatitis B recommendations for immunocompromised children, refer to 3.3.3 Vaccination of immunocompromised persons.\nAdolescents\nVaccination of adolescents 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c13 years of age is recommended for all those in this age group who have not already received a primary course of hepatitis B vaccine. Refer to your state\/territory health authority for further information about hepatitis B vaccine for this age group (refer to Appendix 1 Contact details for Australian, state and territory government health authorities and communicable disease control).\nAs the risk in Australian schools is very low,61 vaccination of classroom contacts of hepatitis B cases is seldom indicated. Nevertheless, vaccination of all children and adolescents should be encouraged.\nA 2-dose schedule of hepatitis B vaccine using the adult formulation of either of the available monovalent vaccines should be considered for adolescents aged 11\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 years who are to receive hepatitis B vaccination (refer to Table 4.5.1 and 4.5.4 Vaccines above). A 2-dose schedule increases compliance and thus protection in this age group.\nAdolescents who did not receive an age-appropriate completed course of vaccination should be identified and offered catch-up vaccination, particularly if they fall into one of the risk categories for hepatitis B infection, discussed under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAdults\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 below.\nAdults \nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for the following groups of adults because they are either at a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection and\/or at higher risk of severe disease. Refer to Tables 4.5.1 and 4.5.2  Vaccines above for recommended adult vaccination schedules. Serological testing for previous or chronic hepatitis B infection may be indicated in many circumstances (refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSerological testing prior to hepatitis B vaccination\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 below). Refer also to 3.3 Groups with special vaccination requirements.\nWhen vaccination against both hepatitis B and hepatitis A is indicated, the combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccines may be used. Refer to Tables 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 above and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRecommendations for the use of combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 below. \nHousehold or other close (household-like) contacts of persons with hepatitis B \nThere is a low, but definite, risk of transmission from a person with acute or chronic hepatitis B to household or other close residential contacts (e.g. students or asylum seekers sharing residential facilities). This can be reduced by avoiding contact with blood or other body fluids and not sharing items that may penetrate the skin (such as combs, nail brushes, toothbrushes and razors). Immunisation of susceptible household-like contacts is strongly recommended. This includes household members of the adoptive family if the adopted child is known to have chronic hepatitis B infection. \nSexual contacts of persons with hepatitis B \nSusceptible sexual partners of persons who are HBsAg-positive should be offered post-exposure HBIG and hepatitis B vaccination; both should be initiated within 14 days of the last sexual contact (refer to 4.5.11 Public health management of hepatitis B below and Table 4.5.3).\nHepatitis B is relatively common in clients of sexual health services and vaccination should be offered to susceptible persons at the time of first attendance.\nSusceptible, sexually active men who have sex with men should be vaccinated. The combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccine may be appropriate for men who have sex with men, if they are not immune to either disease, as they are at increased risk of both conditions (refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRecommendations for the use of combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 below).\nMigrants from hepatitis B endemic countries\nMigrants from hepatitis B endemic countries have a higher likelihood of having been previously infected with hepatitis B and of having a close household contact with chronic hepatitis B infection. Such persons should be offered testing for hepatitis B, and vaccination if appropriate. (Refer also to 3.3.8 Vaccination of migrants to Australia.) Areas of high endemicity, indicated by high seroprevalence of HBsAg, include most of East and Southeast Asia (except Japan), Pacific island groups, parts of central Asia and the Middle East, the Amazon Basin, and sub-Saharan Africa.62 \nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people\nThere is an increased risk of acquiring new HBV infection among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people compared with other Australians.17,18 Although many younger Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, especially children and adolescents, would have been eligible for, and have received, hepatitis B vaccination through population-wide vaccination programs, it is recommended that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have their risks and vaccination status for hepatitis B reviewed, be offered testing for previous hepatitis B infection, and be offered vaccination if non-immune. (Refer also to 3.1 Vaccination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.)\nAdult haemodialysis patients and patients with severely impaired renal function in whom dialysis is anticipated\nDialysis patients, and patients with severely impaired renal function in whom dialysis is anticipated, may be at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection and also respond less well to vaccination. These patients should be given a larger than usual dose of hepatitis B vaccine. \nAdult haemodialysis or pre-dialysis patients should be given either: \nSolid organ and haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients \nIf seronegative for hepatitis B, solid organ transplant recipients should be vaccinated before transplantation as they may be at increased risk of infection from the transplanted organ.64 Haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients should be revaccinated following transplantation, due to the loss of immune memory that often follows the transplant procedure. (Refer also to 3.3.3 Vaccination of immunocompromised persons.)\nHIV-positive adults and other immunocompromised adults \nHIV-positive adults, and other immunocompromised adults, may be at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection and also respond less well to vaccination. Limited studies in HIV1-positive adults have demonstrated an improved and accelerated serological response to a schedule that consists of 4 double doses, comprising two injections of the standard adult dose (using Engerix-B) on each occasion, at times 0, 1, 2 and 6 months.65,66\nPersons with chronic liver disease and\/or hepatitis C\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for those in this category who are seronegative for hepatitis B, because of the risk of severe liver disease following infection with hepatitis B.67\nPersons who inject drugs\nPersons who inject drugs should be tested, and be vaccinated if they have not previously been infected with HBV.\nRecipients of certain blood products\nScreening of all blood donors for HBV using HBsAg and nucleic acid amplification tests has greatly decreased the incidence of transfusion-related hepatitis B virus infection. Since 2010, nucleic acid testing has been introduced nationally to improve detection of hepatitis B infection in donated blood, mainly through reduction of the infectious window period when acute hepatitis B infection may not be detected using HBsAg, but also through detecting persons with occult hepatitis B infection. This further reduces the residual risk of hepatitis B transmission through transfusion in Australia, to approximately 1 in 982 000 per unit transfused.21 However, persons with clotting disorders who receive blood product concentrates, persons with recurrent transfusion requirements, and persons with underlying immunocompromise68 have an elevated risk of hepatitis B virus infection, and should therefore be vaccinated.\nPersons with developmental disabilities \nVaccination is recommended for persons who attend either residential or non-residential day-care facilities for persons with developmental disabilities. This is due to the high prevalence of markers indicating past or current infection in persons in these settings, including an HBsAg prevalence of >10%.69-71 \nInmates of correctional facilities\nInmates are at increased risk of hepatitis B infection because of the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B among inmates, and the potential for unprotected sexual intercourse, injecting drug use and amateur tattooing in correctional facilities. Therefore, they should be offered the opportunity to be screened for hepatitis Bupon incarceration, as part of the preventive health program for blood-borne viruses, and vaccinated if susceptible.\nSex industry workers\nSex industry workers are one of the population groups at higher risk of HBV infection. They have been specifically identified as an important population on which to focus for the prevention of hepatitis B transmission.72 They are at a particularly high risk if they engage in unprotected sex.\nPersons at occupational risk\nThe risk to persons in certain occupations differs considerably from setting to setting in different parts of Australia. However, it is recommended that all staff directly involved in patient care and\/or the handling of human tissue, blood or body fluids should be vaccinated. In addition, standard precautions against exposure to human tissue, blood or body fluids should be used as a matter of routine.73\nOther occupations where the risk of acquiring hepatitis B is increased include:\nStaff of child day-care centres will normally be at minimal risk of hepatitis B. If advice on risk is sought, the enquiry should be directed to the local public health authority.\nContact sports generally carry a low risk of hepatitis B infection. However, age-appropriate hepatitis B vaccination is recommended.\nTravellers to hepatitis B endemic areas\nPersons travelling to regions of intermediate or high endemicity, either long-term or for frequent short terms, or who are likely to undertake activities that increase their risks of exposure to HBV during travel, should be vaccinated.62 (Refer also to 3.2 Vaccination for international travel.) \nRecommendations for the use of combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccines \nCombination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccines should be considered for susceptible persons in whom both hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines are recommended, including:\nIf a combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccine is not available, monovalent hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines can be administered simultaneously (in separate syringes at separate sites) (refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcInterchangeability of hepatitis B vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 above).\nRefer to 4.5.7  Recommendations above and 4.4 Hepatitis A for more details. Refer also to 3.3 Groups with special vaccination requirements.\nBooster doses\nBooster doses of hepatitis B vaccine (after completion of a primary course by using recommended schedule) are not recommended for immunocompetent persons. This applies to children and adults, including healthcare workers and dentists.74-80 This is because there is good evidence that a completed primary course of hepatitis B vaccination provides long-lasting protection. Even though vaccine-induced antibody levels may decline with time and may become undetectable, immune memory persists and is thought to result in a protective immune response on re-exposure.81 However, booster doses are recommended for persons who are immunocompromised, in particular those with either HIV infection or renal failure. The time for boosting in such persons should be decided by regular monitoring of anti-HBs levels at 6- to 12-monthly intervals.74\nSerological testing prior to hepatitis B vaccination\nRoutine antenatal screening of all pregnant women for HBsAg is recommended to allow appropriate measures to be implemented to prevent newborn infants developing chronic HBV infection49-51 (refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcManagement of infants born to mothers who are HBsAg-positive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 above).\nSerological testing for evidence of past (or current) hepatitis B infection prior to vaccination may be warranted for certain older children, adolescents and adults. This is particularly so for those at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection, such as persons who inject drugs, sex industry workers, immunocompromised persons, and those living in communities with higher prevalence of HBV, including migrant communities and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Serological testing enables identification of persons who were infected by HBV, to facilitate timely appropriate clinical management and prevention of onward transmission, hence reducing population impact of HBV infection. Testing also identifies those who are susceptible to HBV infection and, as such, should be offered vaccination if they continue to have a high exposure risk (refer to 4.5.7 Recommendations above).72 Testing for immunity to hepatitis A infection (and vaccination of susceptible at-risk persons with combination hepatitis A\/hepatitis B vaccines) may also be indicated for some population groups at increased risk of hepatitis A exposure (refer to 4.4  Hepatitis A). \nInterpretation of the results of serological testing may be enhanced by discussion with the laboratory that performed the test, ensuring that relevant clinical information is provided.\nSerological testing following hepatitis B vaccination \nAnti-HBs antibody and HBsAg levels should be measured in infants born to mothers with chronic hepatitis B infection 3 to 12 months after completing the primary vaccine course (for more information refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcManagement of infants born to mothers who are HBsAg-positive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 above).\nOther than for infants born to mothers with chronic hepatitis B infection, post-vaccination serological testing is recommended 4 to 8 weeks after completion of the primary course for persons in the following categories:\nFor these individuals, if adequate anti-HBs levels (\u00e2\u2030\u00a510 mIU\/mL) are not reached on serological testing 4 to 8 weeks after the 3rd dose, the possibility of HBV infection, including chronic HBV infection, should be investigated by testing for serological markers, including HBsAg and anti-HBc antibodies. In select cases in which hepatitis B infection is suspected, HBV nucleic acid testing may also be indicated, and expert advice regarding further management should be sought. If there are no markers of HBV infection, the individual should be managed as a non-responder to hepatitis B vaccination (refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNon-responders to primary vaccination\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 below).\nIf persons who are at significant risk of hepatitis B (such as healthcare workers) were not tested for anti-HBs within 4 to 8 weeks after completion of the documented primary course, they should still undergo serological testing to ensure immunity. If, on testing, they have an anti-HBs level of <10 mIU\/mL, they should be given a single booster dose (4th dose) of vaccine. Persons with immune memory established from effective prior vaccination should respond to this booster dose. Anti-HBs should be checked 4 weeks later, and if the anti-HBs level remains <10 mIU\/mL, the possibility of HBV infection should be investigated (and, if excluded, the person should be managed as a non-responder to vaccination, refer to below). If the anti-HBs level is \u00e2\u2030\u00a510 mIU\/mL, the person can be regarded as immune.\nNon-responders to primary vaccination\nA non-responder is a person without HBV infection who has a documented history of an age-appropriate primary course of hepatitis B vaccine, but with a current anti-HBs level <10 mIU\/mL. There are a number of potential options for non-responders. Persons who do not respond to the primary vaccination course, and in whom chronic HBV infection has been excluded, should be offered further doses. \nAs discussed above, in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSerological testing following hepatitis B vaccination\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, a single booster dose (4th dose) of vaccine can be given to confirm non-responder status. Persons who are non-responders after being given the booster\/4th dose (and in whom HBV infection has been excluded) should have 2 further doses of hepatitis B vaccine at monthly intervals, and be re-tested for anti-HBs levels at least 4 weeks after the last dose. The booster\/4th dose that was received could be counted as the 1st of the 3 repeat doses, as recommended for non-responders. A few small studies have reported attainment of seroprotection in non-responders with high-dose formulations or double-dose administration for a 4th, or subsequent, dose of hepatitis B vaccination, but there is no consistent evidence to suggest that a higher proportion of subjects would respond with these higher-dose regimens.82-84\nFor HBsAg-negative healthcare workers who are non-responders to a primary course of vaccination and to subsequent additional IM doses (\u00e2\u2030\u00a55 doses in total), some small observational studies report that some individuals may respond to the vaccine administered intradermally.85-87 Engerix-B (0.25 mL [5 \u00ce\u00bcg] per dose) was used in these studies, giving up to 4 doses.85 Younger age and longer duration (\u00e2\u2030\u00a56 months) since the last IM dose may be associated with greater probability of response.86 If an intradermal dose(s) is given, it is recommended that the anti-HBs levels be measured before each subsequent dose to assess for seroconversion. \nPersistent non-responders should be informed that they should be considered not protected against hepatitis B and should minimise exposures. They should also be informed about the need for HBIG within 72 hours of parenteral or mucosal exposure to HBV (refer to Table 4.5.3). \n4.5.8 Pregnancy and breastfeeding\nHepatitis B vaccine is not routinely recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. However, the WHO states that neither pregnancy nor breastfeeding is a contraindication to the use of this vaccine.88\nRefer to 3.3 Groups with special vaccination requirements, Table 3.3.1 Recommendations for vaccination in pregnancy for more information.\n4.5.9 Contraindications\nThe only absolute contraindications to hepatitis B vaccines are:\nIn particular, hepatitis B vaccines are contraindicated in persons with a history of anaphylaxis to yeast.\n4.5.10 Adverse events\nExtensive experience indicates that the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine is very well tolerated by newborn infants. It does not interfere with either the establishment or maintenance of breastfeeding, and it is not associated with an increased risk of either fever, medical investigation for sepsis, or serious outcomes in newborns who were vaccinated compared with the unvaccinated.89-91\nAdverse events after hepatitis B vaccination are transient and minor, and include soreness at the injection site (5%), fever (usually low grade; 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3%), nausea, dizziness, malaise, myalgia and arthralgia. Fever can be expected in some neonates following immunisation with hepatitis B vaccine (0.6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3.7%).\nAnaphylaxis has been reported very rarely in adults, notably in yeast-sensitive individuals.92 Although various adverse events such as demyelinating diseases, Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd syndrome and arthritis have been reported, there is no evidence of a causal relationship with hepatitis B vaccination.92,93 \nThe World Health Organization Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety states that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmultiple studies and review panels have concluded that there is no link between MS [multiple sclerosis] and hepatitis B vaccination\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.94,95\nThe vaccine produces neither therapeutic effects nor adverse events in persons with chronic HBV infection. It is also safe, though of no additional benefit, in those already immune to hepatitis B through past natural infection.\n4.5.11 Public health management of hepatitis B\nAcute hepatitis B and newly identified chronic hepatitis B are notifiable diseases in all states and territories in Australia.\nFurther instructions about the public health management of hepatitis B, including management of cases of acute hepatitis B and newly identified chronic hepatitis B, and their contacts, should be obtained from state\/territory public health authorities (refer to Appendix 1 Contact details for Australian, state and territory government health authorities and communicable disease control). \nFollowing significant exposure (percutaneous, ocular or mucous membrane) to blood or to potentially blood-contaminated secretions, where feasible, the source individual should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible.\nIf the person exposed has not been previously vaccinated against hepatitis B, their anti-HBs level, and anti-HBc and HBsAg status, should be determined immediately. If the person exposed is anti-HBs and anti-HBc negative (non-immune) and the source is either HBsAg-positive or cannot be identified and tested rapidly, a single dose of HBIG should be administered according to the recommendations in Table 4.5.3. below. The dose of HBIG is 100 IU for children weighing up to 30 kg (about 5 years of age) and 400 IU for all others. Hepatitis Bvaccine must also be given as soon as possible, with further doses as recommended in Table 4.5.3. below. \nFor previously vaccinated persons exposed to either an HBsAg-positive source or a source whose hepatitis B status cannot be determined, post-exposure prophylaxis is not necessary if there was a documented protective response (anti-HBs level \u00e2\u2030\u00a510 mIU\/mL) at any time after vaccination. If the response to previous vaccination is unknown, the anti-HBs level should be determined as quickly as possible. If the anti-HBs level is <10 mIU\/mL and there is no evidence of HBV infection, HBIG and HBV vaccine should be administered as per Table 4.5.3. below.\nAll healthcare workers should be immunised against hepatitis B. Completion of a full course of hepatitis B vaccination is strongly recommended for any non-immune healthcare worker who has sustained a needle-stick injury or other potential hepatitis B exposure.\n* Refer also to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcManagement of infants born to mothers who are HBsAg-positive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 above.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a0 The 1st dose can be given at the same time as HBIG, but should be administered at a separate site. Administration as soon as possible after exposure is preferred.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a1 There is limited evidence for efficacy if given within 14 days of contact; however, administration as soon as possible after exposure is preferred.\nHepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) is prepared from plasma donated through routine blood bank collection. Samples are selected on the basis that they contain high levels of anti-HBs antibodies. As stocks of HBIG are very limited, use should be strictly reserved for those who are at high risk, such as babies born to mothers with chronic HBV infection and non-immune persons who are exposed through occupational exposure to the blood of unidentified persons or to persons who are chronically infected with hepatitis B or whose hepatitis status cannot be ascertained in time.88 Requests should be directed to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service in your state\/territory (refer to 5.1.1 Availability of immunoglobulins in Part 5 Passive immunisation).\n4.5.12 Variations from product information\nThe product information for Infanrix hexa states that this vaccine is indicated for primary immunisation of infants from the age of 6 weeks and as a booster dose for children 18 months of age if boosting is required for all antigens. The ATAGI recommends that this vaccine may also be used for catch-up of the primary schedule in children <10 years of age.\nThe product information for Infanrix hexa states that this vaccine is contraindicated in children with encephalopathy of unknown aetiology or with neurologic complications occurring within 7 days following a vaccine dose. The ATAGI recommends instead that the only contraindication is a history of anaphylaxis to a previous dose or to any of the vaccine components.\nDandri M, Locarnini S.

About 10% of people who get mumps also get meningitis, but mumps meningitis is usually mild. Mumps can also cause encephalitis, leading to permanent brain damage. In rare cases, men with both testicles infected with mumps become sterile.\nIn the last ten years there have been outbreaks of mumps mostly among young adults in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Alberta. These outbreaks demonstrate how certain population groups are susceptible to getting mumps due to lack of previous vaccination or incomplete vaccination.\n \t \tPublic Health Agency of Canada.

However, because of the safety, effectiveness and low cost of mumps vaccine it makes sense to vaccinate children.\nAfter vaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Data from Canada, the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Finland show that the number of cases of mumps decreased by over 90% after mumps vaccine became available. Mumps encephalitis has virtually disappeared from countries with effective vaccination programs.\n","102":"Varicella (chickenpox) is caused by a virus called Varicella-Zoster. It starts with a fever and is followed by a rash of red spots that may be itchy. There may be hundreds of these spots, which eventually turn into blisters filled with fluid. After four or five days, the blisters dry out and become crusted. From start to finish, chickenpox may last seven to ten days.\nThe virus spreads easily and quickly through personal contact such as touching the blisters. People with chickenpox can also spread the virus through the air when they cough or sneeze. A pregnant woman can pass the chickenpox virus on to her baby before it is born.\nMost adults today who grew up in Canada had chickenpox as children. It is estimated that 90% of children who are not vaccinated for chickenpox will get it by the time they are twelve. As a general rule, you can only get chickenpox once, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also possible for the virus to remain in your body and become active again later on. When this happens, the virus causes a painful rash of blisters called shingles.\nMost children who get chickenpox recover completely. However, severe cases of chickenpox can pose serious health risks, especially for newborn babies, adults, or anyone with a weakened immune system.\nPublic Health Agency of Canada.

Almost everyone got measles. Every year in Canada, measles was responsible for 50 to 75 deaths, 5000 hospital admissions and 400 cases of encephalitis. The estimated annual cost of measles was over $70 million (1985 dollars).\n1954\u00e2\u20ac\u201c63\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c The measles virus  was isolated and a vaccine was developed.\nSince  1963\u00e2\u20ac\u201c The number of cases has fallen by over 99% (from about 350,000 per  year before 1963 to less than 2000 per year in  1995.)\n1995\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2362 cases of measles were reported in Canada, leading to the eventual introduction of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153two-dose immunization\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regimen. All provinces and territories also launched \u00e2\u20ac\u0153catch-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vaccination campaigns except New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and  Newfoundland.\n1996\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c The catch-up campaigns stopped three outbreaks developing in early 1996, resulting in only 327 cases reported in Canada for the  year.\n1997\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c Through an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153importation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd* a measles epidemic  started in British Columbia among students attending Simon Fraser University, spreading through the province. It primarily affected individuals aged 19 to 29 years.\nNew Brunswick was the last province to  introduce a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153two-dose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd immunization schedule.\nSince  1998\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c Canada has had national, active measles surveillance in place  since 1998. All provinces and territories report confirmed cases of measles weekly to the Public Health Agency of Canada who in turn report weekly to the Pan American Health Organization.\n* \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Importation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is defined as when a case has travelled from another country 7 to 21 days prior to the onset of rash and for whom there was no local exposure to measles.\n","104":"                                   Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis                                  \n                                   Disease Issues                                  \n                                   Is                                      it true that pertussis in children is increasing?

These increases have been noted in both infants younger                                      than age 1 year, particularly                                     among infants younger than age 6 months; adolescents age 11\u009618                                      years, and adults.

How many doses of pediatric diphtheria-tetanus-acellular                                      pertussis (DTaP) vaccine does an infant need before she or he is                                      protected from                                     pertussis?                                  \n                                   Vaccine efficacy is 80%\u009685% following 3 doses of DTaP vaccine.                                      Efficacy data following just 1 or 2 doses are lacking but are likely                                      lower. Therefore, it is                                     especially important that you advise parents of infants and all                                      people who live with the infant or who provide care to him or her be                                      protected against                                     pertussis. It is recommended that the infant's family members and                                      potential visitors receive a one-time dose of adolescent\/adult                                      tetanus-diphtheria-acellular                                     (Tdap) vaccine if they have not already done so.                                  \n                                   Can a child or an adult who has had                                      pertussis get the disease again?                                  \n                                   Reinfection appears to be uncommon, but does occur. Reinfection may                                      present as a persistent cough rather than typical pertussis.                                  \n                                   Should further doses of pertussis                                      vaccine be given to an infant or child who has had culture-proven                                      pertussis?                                  \n                                   Immunity to pertussis following infection is not life-long. Persons                                      with a history of pertussis should continue to receive                                      pertussis-containing vaccines                                     according to the recommended schedule. (Note: This answer is based                                      upon recommendations of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases.)                                  \n                                   If an adolescent or adult who has never                                      received their one-time dose of Tdap is either infected with or                                      exposed to pertussis, is vaccination with Tdap still                                     necessary, and if so when?                                  \n                                   Yes. Adolescents or adults who have a history of pertussis disease                                      generally should receive Tdap according to the routine                                      recommendation. This practice is                                     recommended because the duration of protection induced by pertussis                                      disease is unknown (waning might begin as early as 7 years after                                      infection) and because                                     diagnosis of pertussis can be difficult to confirm, particularly                                      with tests other than culture for B. pertussis. Administering                                      pertussis vaccine to people                                     with a history of pertussis presents no theoretical risk.

Research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of Tdap to prevent                                      pertussis in healthcare settings. Until studies define the optimal                                      management of exposed                                     vaccinated healthcare personnel, or experts arrive at consensus,                                      healthcare facilities should continue to follow the post-exposure                                      prophylaxis protocol for                                     vaccinated HCWs who are exposed to pertussis.                                  \n                                   What are the recommendations for                                      vaccination of infants and young children with DTaP?                                  \n                                   All children should receive a series of DTaP at ages 2, 4, and 6                                      months, with boosters at ages 15-18 months and at 4-6 years. The                                      fourth dose may be given as                                     early as age 12 months if at least 6 months have elapsed since the                                      third dose.                                  \n                                   What are the                                      recommendations for use of Tdap in children and adults                                      ages 7 and older?                                  \n                                   In response to an increased incidence of pertussis in the                                      U.S., ACIP has issued several new recommendations for the                                      use of Tdap vaccine. The complete                                     recommendations follow.                                   \n                                           \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2                                            \u00c2\u00a0                                            Adolescents and                                              adults who have not received a dose of Tdap, or for                                              whom vaccine status is unknown, should receive a                                              single dose of Tdap as soon as                                             feasible. As stated above, Tdap can be administered                                              regardless of interval since the previous Td dose.                                          \n                                           \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2                                            \u00c2\u00a0                                            Children ages 7                                              through 10 years who are not fully immunized against                                              pertussis (i.e., did not complete a series of                                              pertussis-containing vaccine before                                             their seventh birthday) should receive a single dose of                                              Tdap.

Someone who received a dose of Tdap at age 11 or 12 should receive a booster dose of Td vaccine ten years later, unless tetanus prophylaxis is required  sooner due to an injury.                                   \n                                   Aren't the recent ACIP                                      recommendations for expanded use of Tdap vaccine in children ages 7                                      through 9 years and in adults age 65 years and older different                                     from what is on the package inserts?                                  \n                                   Yes. Sometimes ACIP makes recommendations that differ from the                                      FDA-approved package insert indications, and this is one of those                                      instances. ACIP                                     recommendations represent the standard of care for vaccination                                      practice in the United States.                                  \n                                   We have a 63-year-old patient who states she had tetanus as a child. She does not know whether she ever had any                                      tetanus-containing vaccines in her lifetime. Should Tdap be given to this patient, and is it safe?                                  \n                                   A history of tetanus disease is not a reason to avoid tetanus-containing vaccines. Tetanus disease does not                                      produce immunity because of the very small amount of toxin required to produce illness. As long as your patient has                                      no other contraindications she should receive Tdap now. If she has no documentation of prior tetanus vaccination,                                      she should receive a complete 3-dose primary series (dose #1 of Tdap, followed by dose #2 of Td 4 to 8 weeks later,                                      and dose #3 of Td 6\u009612 months after dose #2).                                  \n                                   I'm confused about the various                                      vaccines that contain tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Can you                                      explain?                                  \n                                   There are two basic products that can be used in children younger                                      than age 7 years (DTaP and DT) and two that can be used in older                                      children and adults (Td                                     and Tdap). Some people get confused between DTaP and Tdap and others                                      get confused between DT and Td. Here's a hint to help you remember.                                      The pediatric                                     formulations usually have 3-5 times as much of the diphtheria                                      component than what is in the adult formulation.

The amount of tetanus toxoid in each                                      of the products is                                     equivalent, so it remains an upper-case \"T.\"                                  \n                                   Can we use the two DTaP products                                      interchangeably?                                  \n                                   There are two different DTaP products currently used in the U.S. for                                      the primary series for children ages 2 months through 6 years (Daptacel                                      by sanofi                                     pasteur and Infanrix by GlaxoSmithKline). ACIP has recommended that,                                      whenever feasible, healthcare providers should use the same brand of                                      DTaP vaccine for                                     all doses in the vaccination series. If vaccination providers do not                                      know or have available the type of DTaP vaccine previously                                      administered to a child, any                                     DTaP vaccine may be used to continue or complete the series. For                                      vaccines in general, vaccination should not be deferred because the                                      brand used for previous                                     doses is not available or is unknown (see page 10 of the ACIP's                                      General Recommendations on Immunization at www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/pdf\/rr\/rr6002.pdf).                                  \n                                   What should we do if we don't know                                      which brand of DTaP a child had previously?                                  \n                                   If the DTaP brand used for previous doses is not known or not in                                      stock, use whatever DTaP vaccine you have available for all                                      subsequent doses.                                  \n                                   Someone gave Tdap to an infant                                      instead of DTaP. Now what should be done?                                  \n                                   If Tdap was inadvertently administered to a child under age 7 years,                                      it should not be counted as either the first, second, or third dose                                      of DTaP. The dose                                     should be repeated with DTaP. Continue vaccinating on schedule. If                                      the dose of Tdap was administered for the fourth or fifth DTaP dose,                                      the Tdap dose can be                                     counted as valid. Please remind your staff to always check the                                      vaccine vial at least 3 times before administering any vaccine.                                  \n                                   We would like to avoid stocking both                                      Tdap and Td vaccines. Is CDC likely to recommend that Tdap                                      completely replace Td in the immunization schedule in the                                     near future?                                  \n                                   Currently, ACIP recommends giving only 1 dose of Tdap to adolescents and adults who have not previously received the vaccine, with the exception of pregnant women, who should be vaccinated during each pregnancy. ACIP is unlikely to recommend routine Tdap revaccination for groups other than pregnant women. Therefore, medical settings will need to continue to stock Td vaccine in order to administer it to patients who need to complete the full primary 3-dose tetanus and diphtheria series and also to administer 10-year booster doses of Td throughout the lifetime of those who have completed the primary series. Note that if a person who previously received Tdap needs a booster dose of Td (as a routine booster dose or for wound management) it is acceptable to administer Tdap if Td is not available.                                  \n                                   I have a patient who received                                      single-antigen tetanus (TT) in the emergency room rather than Td or                                      Tdap. Should he be revaccinated?                                  \n                                   ACIP recommends that patients needing prophylaxis against tetanus                                      always be given either Td or, if appropriate, Tdap rather than TT,                                      as long as there is no                                     contraindication to the other vaccine components. If it's already                                      been given and the person had not yet received Tdap as an adolescent                                      or adult, you should                                     make certain that he gets Tdap as soon as feasible. If he had                                      received Tdap previously, he can wait until the next scheduled                                      booster dose is due to get his                                     routine Td booster.                                  \n                                   When should a person receive tetanus                                      toxoid (TT) alone?                                  \n                                   Single antigen tetanus toxoid should only be used in rare instances,                                      for example when a person has had a documented severe allergic                                      response to diphtheria                                     toxoid.                                  \n                                   In what year did tetanus toxoid                                      first become available? At what age might most patients never have                                      received a primary series?                                  \n                                   Tetanus toxoid became commercially available in 1938, but was not                                      widely used until the military began routine vaccination in 1941.                                      Routine administration of                                     tetanus toxoid was recommended by the AAP in 1944. Most World War II                                      military personnel received at least one dose of tetanus toxoid, but                                      civilian use,                                     particularly for adults, did not increase until after the war. You                                      should not assume the tetanus vaccination status for any person                                      based on their age alone.                                     Only a written record is acceptable proof of immunization. People                                      without documentation should be assumed to be unimmunized.                                  \n                                   If a dose of DTaP or Tdap                                      is inadvertently given to a patient for whom the product                                      is not indicated (e.g., wrong age group), how do we                                      rectify the situation?                                  \n                                   The first step is to inform the parent\/patient that you                                      administered the wrong vaccine. Next, follow these                                      guidelines:                                  \n                                         \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2                                                                                    Tdap                                            given to a child younger than age 7 years as either                                            dose 1, 2, or 3, is NOT valid.

Please help!                                  \n                                   CDC published updated recommendations on Tdap vaccination for adults                                      in the MMWR on June 29, 2012. ACIP recommends that ALL adults age 19                                      years and older who                                     have not yet received a dose of Tdap receive a single dose. Tdap                                      should be administered regardless of interval since the last tetanus                                      or diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine (e.g., Td). After receiving Tdap, people should                                      receive Td every 10 years for routine booster immunization against                                      tetanus and diphtheria,                                     according to previously published guidelines. Pregnant women should                                      receive Tdap during each pregnancy.                                   \n                                   Providers should not miss an opportunity to vaccinate adults age 65                                        and older with Tdap. Providers may administer any Tdap                                        vaccine they have                                       available. When feasible, providers should administer Boostrix (GSK)                                        to adults age 65 and older as it is licensed for this age group.                                        Adacel (sanofi) is                                       licensed for use in people age 10 through 64. However, ACIP                                        concluded that either vaccine administered to a person age 65 or                                        older is immunogenic and will                                       provide protection. A dose of either vaccine is considered valid.                                                                                                            \n                                   When a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine is needed for wound                                        management in a person who has not previously received Tdap, the use                                        of Tdap is preferred over                                       Td.                                  \n                                   We see many 10-year-olds for middle                                    school entry immunization.

Both Tdap products, Adacel and Boostrix                                    (GSK), now have the same lower age indication.                                  \n                                   We have a 13-year-old                                      patient who was given DT (pediatric) as a preschooler after she had                                      experienced excessive crying following a dose of DTP. Now, we are                                     wondering if we can give her Tdap since we know she may not be                                      protected against pertussis.                                  \n                                   Yes, you can. Many of the precautions to DTaP (e.g., temperature of                                      105\u00c2\u00b0F or higher, collapse or shock-like state, persistent crying                                      lasting 3 hours or                                     longer, seizure with or without fever) do not apply to Tdap. This                                      issue is discussed in CDC's Tdap recommendations, available at www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/PDF\/rr\/rr5503.pdf.                                  \n                                   Should I make an effort to give                                      teenagers a Tdap dose, even if they've had a dose of Td at age 11\u009612                                      years?                                  \n                                   Yes. All adolescents should receive one dose of Tdap vaccine to                                      protect them from pertussis, even if they have already received Td.                                      It is important to do                                     this right away (no minimal interval is required), especially if                                      they are in contact with an infant younger than age 12 months, work                                      in a healthcare setting                                     where they have direct contact with patients, or live in a community                                      where pertussis is occurring.                                  \n                                   We have a 16-year-old patient who                                      received tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine in the emergency room after                                      a nail puncture a year ago. Can we give him a                                     tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine now?                                  \n                                   Yes. There is no need to observe any minimum interval between doses                                      of Td and Tdap.                                  \n                                   Some children in my practice are not                                      up to date on their immunizations, and pertussis is circulating in                                      our community. Can you guide me in determining how                                     to make the decision about which vaccine to choose?                                  \n                                   You should use DTaP in children younger than age 7 years. In                                      addition, ACIP recommends to give a single dose of Tdap to children                                      ages 7 through 10 years who                                     did not finish a minimum 3-dose series of pertussis-containing                                      vaccines before their 7th birthday (or for whom their pertussis                                      vaccine status is unknown).                                     Although this is an off-label use of the vaccines, it's important                                      that you vaccinate these vulnerable children with Tdap as well as                                      any other adolescent or                                     adult who hasn't received Tdap previously.                                  \n                                   I need to know how to catch-up a child                                      who is 12 years old and received 1 dose of DTaP vaccine at age 2                                      years and a dose of Tdap at age 11 years.                                  \n                                   This child needs to complete the primary series with 1 dose of Td,                                      administered no earlier than 6 months after the Tdap dose given at                                      age 11 years. After                                     that, the child needs a booster dose of Td every 10 years. An easy                                      way to determine how to catch up a child is to consult \"Recommended                                      Immunization Schedules                                     for Persons Aged 0 Through 18 Years, U.S.\" The schedule is approved                                      by CDC, AAP, and AAFP and is released early in each calendar year.                                      It includes a catch-up                                     schedule for children who have fallen behind (see www.cdc.gov\/vaccines\/schedules\/index.html).                                  \n                                   A 16-year-old has a written record of receiving two doses of DTaP at 2 and 5 months of age and one dose of Tdap at 15 years of age. Since she has had three doses of pertussis-containing vaccine, would she still need two additional doses of Td?                                   \n                                    Since the first DTaP was received before 12 months of age and one Tdap dose has been given, this person needs one dose of Td 6 calendar months after the Tdap dose. A routine Td booster should be administered every 10 years.

The problem is he can't                                     remember if he received Tdap or Td, and we can't obtain an                                      immunization record. His wife is pregnant, and we would like to                                      immunize him against pertussis as                                     a way to protect their soon-to-be-born child. Should we give him                                      Tdap in this situation?                                  \n                                   Yes.

Parents should receive a single dose of Tdap as soon as                                      possible to protect their baby from pertussis. If a dose of Td was                                      given within the previous 2                                     years, parents should still be vaccinated with Tdap as soon as                                      possible regardless of the time interval since the last dose of Td.                                      Other household contacts                                     that are not up to date with their pertussis-containing vaccinations                                      should also be appropriately vaccinated. Preferably, they should be                                      vaccinated before                                     the infant is born.                                  \n                                   Can Tdap be given at the same visit                                      as other vaccines?                                  \n                                   Yes.

Each vaccine                                     should be administered at a different anatomic site using a separate                                      syringe.                                  \n                                   Someone in our clinic gave DTaP to a                                      50-year-old instead of Tdap.

Count the dose as                                     Tdap, but take measures to prevent this error in the future. The                                      patient does not need a repeat dose of Tdap.                                  \n                                   A pertussis outbreak is occurring                                      in our town, with many cases happening in the schools.

If there is no written documentation that she received a dose                                      of Tdap prior to or during pregnancy, a dose of Tdap should be                                      administered to her                                     immediately postpartum.                                  \n                                   If there is no documentation of a                                      pregnant woman ever receiving Td or Tdap, what schedule should we                                      follow?                                  \n                                   The recommended schedule for the primary series given to an                                      unvaccinated person is dose 1 now, dose 2 in 4 weeks, and dose 3 in                                      6 to 12 months. Tdap should                                     replace 1 dose of Td, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation                                      to maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody                                      transfer to the infant.                                  \n                                   Some women have closely spaced                                      pregnancies. Should we give Tdap during each pregnancy, even if it                                      means such women would get 2 doses within 12 months?                                  \n                                   Yes. ACIP looked into this issue and included related information in                                      its recommendations published in MMWR on February 22, 2013 (www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/mm6207a4.htm). ACIP reviewed available data                                      on birth statistics and found that among U.S. women who have                                      more than one                                     pregnancy, a very small percentage (2.5%) have an interval of 12                                      months or less between births. The majority of women who have two                                      pregnancies have an                                     interval of 13 months or more between births. Approximately 5% of                                      women have four or more pregnancies. ACIP concluded that (1) the interval                                      between subsequent                                     pregnancies is likely to be longer than is the persistence of                                      maternal anti-pertussis antibodies, (2) most women would receive                                      only 2 doses of Tdap, and (3)                                     a small proportion of women would receive 4 or more doses.                                   \n                                   A theoretical risk exists for severe local reactions (e.g., arthus                                      reactions, whole limb swelling) for pregnant women who have                                      multiple, closely spaced                                     pregnancies. However, the frequency of side effects depends on the                                      vaccine's antigen content and product formulation, as well as on                                      preexisting maternal                                     antibody levels related to the interval since the last dose and the                                      number of doses received. The risk for severe adverse events has                                      likely been reduced with                                     current vaccine formulations (including Tdap), which contain lower                                      doses of tetanus toxoid than did older vaccine formulations. ACIP believes the potential                                     benefit of preventing pertussis morbidity and mortality in infants                                      outweighs the theoretical concerns of possible severe adverse events                                      in mothers.                                  \n                                   If a woman received Tdap in early                                      pregnancy, should she get it again in the third trimester?                                  \n                                   No, it is not recommended to give                                      another dose of Tdap in such cases. Optimal timing for Tdap                                      administration is between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation because of transplacental antibody kinetics.                                   \n                                   According to ACIP recommendations                                      published in MMWR on February 22, 2013, \"Tdap may be administered                                      any time during pregnancy, but vaccination during the third                                      trimester would provide the highest concentration of maternal                                      antibodies to be transferred closer to birth.\" More information is                                      available at www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/mm6207a4.htm.                                  \n                                   Each time there is a pregnancy in                                      the family, should fathers and other family members receive a Tdap                                      booster to ensure adequate protection and boost the cocoon effect to                                      protect the newborn from pertussis?                                  \n                                   At this time, ACIP does not                                      recommend additional doses of Tdap for fathers or other family                                      members or caregivers. The multiple Tdap recommendation to optimize                                      immunity for the infant applies only to the pregnant woman.                                  \n                                   At what gestational age of                                      pregnancy should we vaccinate pregnant women with Tdap?                                  \n                                   To maximize maternal antibody response and passive antibody                                      transfer to the infant, the optimal time to administer Tdap is                                      between 27 and 36 weeks'                                     gestation. However, Tdap can be administered at any time during                                      pregnancy. Previously, CDC had recommended that Tdap vaccination                                      occur after 20 weeks'                                     gestation.                                  \n                                   We intend to start vaccinating                                      family contacts of pregnant women with Tdap to protect the newborn.                                      Can you tell me how long it takes for the Tdap vaccine to provide                                      protection?                                  \n                                   To best protect infants, CDC recommends that teens and adults who                                      haven't been vaccinated receive Tdap 2 weeks or more before having                                      contact with an infant.                                     If a 2-week time frame is not available prior to coming into contact                                      with an infant, administer the vaccine as soon as possible.                                  \n                                   If a pregnant woman got a dose of Td                                      during pregnancy, how soon can she get her dose of Tdap?                                  \n                                   While she should have been given Tdap rather than Td, she can                                      receive her Tdap dose at any interval since the Td dose was given                                      and preferably between 27 and                                     36 weeks gestation.                                  \n                                   A 17-year-old received a dose of Tdap vaccine when she was 12 years old. She is now pregnant. Should she get another dose of Tdap vaccine?                                  \n                                   Yes. ACIP recommends a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy irrespective of the patient's prior history of receiving Tdap. To maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant, optimal timing for Tdap administration is between 27 and 36 weeks gestation.

ACIP has not recommended Tdap revaccination for any other group including healthcare providers.                                  \n                                   What schedule should I use to                                      vaccinate adolescents or adults who never received the primary                                      series of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine?                                  \n                                   Children, ages 7 years and older, and adults who have never received                                      tetanus-containing vaccines, or whose vaccination history is                                      unknown, should receive the                                     3-dose series. In this situation, ACIP recommends Tdap for dose #1,                                      followed 4 weeks later by Td for dose #2, followed at least 6 months                                      later by Td for dose                                     #3. Tdap can substitute for only one of the 3 Td doses in the                                      series, preferably the first. The amount of protection provided by a                                      single dose of Tdap in a                                     person who has not previously received pertussis vaccine is not                                      known. Following the primary series, booster doses of Td should be                                      given every 10 years                                     thereafter.                                  \n                                   We are routinely scheduling the 4th                                      dose of DTaP in children at 15\u009618 months, but occasionally would                                      like to give it earlier. Is that okay?                                  \n                                   The fourth dose of DTaP may be given as early as age 12 months if at                                      least 6 months have passed since the third dose.                                  \n                                   When a child comes in for his                                      vaccinations at age 4\u00966 years and presents with an incomplete                                      history of 0-2 doses of DTaP vaccine, how do we determine how                                     many more doses are needed?                                  \n                                   You should try to achieve at least 4 total doses. Give additional                                      doses of DTaP with 4 week intervals until you achieve 3 total doses.                                      Then, if 6 months pass                                     and the child has not turned seven years old, give the 4th dose.                                  \n                                   If a child didn't have the recommended                                      6-month interval between DTaP doses #3 and #4, should it be                                      repeated?                                  \n                                   If DTaP #4 is given with at least a 4-month interval after DTaP #3,                                      it does not need to be repeated. The minimum age of 12 months for                                      the fourth dose must be                                     met. Decreasing the interval to less than 6 months, however, is not                                      recommended.                                  \n                                   If a child has already received 5                                      doses of DTaP by their fourth birthday (with the appropriate 6 month                                      intervals between #3 and #4 and also between #4 and                                     #5), is a booster dose after the fourth birthday necessary?                                  \n                                   In general, a child should receive no more than four doses of DTaP                                      before 4 years of age (preferably by 2 years of age). The ACIP                                      recommends that a dose of                                     DTaP be given at 4\u00966 years of age. Many states have school                                      immunization laws which also require at least one dose of DTP\/DTaP                                      on or after the fourth                                     birthday. This dose is important to boost immunity to pertussis.                                  \n                                   Is there a recommendation about how                                      many doses of DTaP a child can receive by a certain age? Does this                                      include half doses?                                  \n                                   ACIP and AAP both recommend that children receive no more than 6                                      doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (e.g., DT, DTaP, DTP) before                                      the seventh birthday                                     because of concern about adverse reactions, primarily local                                      reactions. Half doses of DTaP are also not recommended under any                                      circumstances, and should not be                                     counted as part of the vaccination series. Only documented doses                                      (i.e., those recorded in an electronic or written record) count                                      toward the maximum of 6                                     doses.                                  \n                                   What is the minimum interval between                                      DTaP #4 and DTaP #5?                                  \n                                   The minimum interval between DTaP #4 and DTaP #5 is six months.                                      Remember that the minimum age for DTaP #5 is age 4 years.                                  \n                                   How should we schedule DTaP for a                                      child with a history of only DT?                                  \n                                   If the child has not received all of the age-appropriate doses of                                      pertussis-containing vaccine, it would be best to try to administer                                      as many doses of DTaP                                     as possible before the child reaches his 7th birthday in order to                                      confer protection against pertussis. Give additional doses of DTaP                                      with 4 week intervals                                     until you achieve 3 total doses. Then, give additional doses with                                      6-month intervals, not to exceed 6 total doses of diphtheria- and                                      tetanus-containing                                     vaccine by the child's 7th birthday.                                  \n                                   I've heard that ACIP and AAP have                                      different recommendations for spacing Tdap and meningococcal                                      conjugate vaccine if they are not given simultaneously. Please                                     discuss.                                  \n                                   This is no longer the case. The ACIP's Tdap recommendations                                      published in the MMWR (www.cdc.gov\/vaccines\/pubs\/acip-list.htm)                                      state that Tdap or Td can be                                     administered at any time before or after meningococcal conjugate                                      vaccine. The AAP also recently stated that \"simultaneous                                      administration of Tdap and all                                     other recommended vaccines is recommended when feasible. Vaccines                                      should not be mixed in the same syringe. Other indicated vaccines                                      that are not available                                     and therefore cannot be given at the time of administration of Tdap                                      can be given at any time thereafter.\" Some experts, however,                                      recommend spacing these two                                     vaccines by a month if they are not given simultaneously. This is                                      out of a theoretical safety concern about giving two vaccines that                                      contain diphtheria                                     toxoid (meningococcal conjugate vaccine contains diphtheria toxoid)                                      unless they are given simultaneously or are spaced 1 month apart.                                  \n                                   What are the contraindications for                                      using DTaP, DT, Tdap, and Td?                                  \n                                   As with all vaccines, a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis)                                      to a vaccine component or to a prior dose is a contraindication to                                      further doses of that                                     vaccine. A history of encephalopathy within 7 days of receiving a                                      previous pertussis-containing vaccine that is not due to another                                      identifiable cause is a                                     contraindication to both DTaP and Tdap.                                  \n                                   What precautions should be observed                                      when giving DTaP, DT, Tdap, or Td?                                  \n                                   A history of Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of                                      receiving a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, and a history of                                      arthus-type hypersensitivity                                     reaction after receiving a previous tetanus or diphtheria                                      toxoid-containing vaccines, including MCV4, is a precaution to                                      further vaccination with any of                                     these vaccines. As with all vaccines, moderate or severe illness is                                      a precaution. Several additional precautions apply only to DTaP (see                                      next question).                                  \n                                   Is it acceptable to give breastfeeding                                    mothers Tdap vaccine?                                    \n                                   Yes. Women who have never received Tdap                                    and who did not receive it during pregnancy                                    should receive it immediately postpartum or as                                    soon as possible thereafter. Breastfeeding                                    does not decrease the immune response to                                    routine childhood vaccines and is not a                                    contraindication for any vaccine except                                    smallpox. Breastfeeding is a precaution for                                    yellow fever vaccine and the vaccine can be                                    given for travel when indicated.                                    \n                                     Can we give Tdap and RhoGam (anti-Rho[D] immune globulin) at the same prenatal visit?                                    \n                                     Tdap is an inactivated vaccine and may be given at the same prenatal visit with RhoGam.

This issue is discussed                                      in the Tdap ACIP recommendations, available at www.cdc.gov\/vaccines\/pubs\/acip-list.htm.                                  \n                                   Can an adult receive Tdap if they                                      had a contraindication or precaution to DTP as a child?                                  \n                                   Tdap has two contraindications and four precautions. The                                      contraindications are (1) anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of                                      the vaccine or any of its                                     components and (2) encephalopathy within 7 days of a previous dose                                      of DTaP or DTP; in this case, give Td instead of Tdap. The                                      precautions are (1) moderate or                                     severe acute illness; (2) history of an arthus-type hypersensitivity                                      reaction following a previous dose of tetanus or diphtheria                                      toxoid-containing vaccines,                                     including MCV4; (3) Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome (GBS) 6 weeks or sooner                                      after a previous dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine; and (4)                                      progressive or                                     unstable neurologic disorder, uncontrolled seizures or progressive                                      encephalopathy until a treatment regimen has been established and                                      the condition has                                     stabilized.

Should we give additional doses of DTaP or should we                                     give just DT?                                  \n                                   Persistent crying following DTaP (as well as other vaccines) has                                      been observed far less frequently than it was following the use of                                      DTP. When it occurred                                     after DTP, it was considered to be an absolute contraindication to                                      further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. When it occurs                                      following DTaP, it is                                     considered a \"precaution\" (or warning). If you believe the benefit                                      of the pertussis vaccine exceeds the risk of more crying (which,                                      although unnerving, is                                     otherwise benign), you can administer DTaP. Many providers choose to                                      administer pertussis-containing vaccine if this is the only                                      precaution the child has                                     experienced. You and the parent will need to make this judgment.                                  \n                                   Can we give further doses of DTaP to                                      an infant who had an afebrile seizure within 3 hours of a previous                                      dose?                                  \n                                   An infant who experiences an afebrile seizure following a dose of                                      DTaP requires further evaluation. An infant with a recent seizure or                                      an evolving neurologic                                     condition should not receive further doses of DTaP, or DT until the                                      condition has been evaluated and stabilized.

Equine antitoxin was also used for passive post-exposure prophylaxis                                      of tetanus (e.g., after                                     a tetanus-prone wound) until the development of human tetanus immune                                      globulin in the late 1950s.

Puncture wounds,                                      however, should be attended to as soon as possible.

The more likely the person is to be susceptible, the more                                      quickly that tetanus prophylaxis should be administered.

A person with a                                      documented series of at least three tetanus toxoid-containing                                      products, with a booster dose within                                     the previous 10 years ago is less likely to be susceptible to                                      tetanus, and the need for a booster dose is not as urgent,                                      particularly if the wound can be                                     thoroughly cleaned.

However, the risk of serious allergic reaction is very rare. In comparison, the risk of severe complications, hopsitalization or death from vaccine-preventable disease is much greater. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.\nVaccines undergo rigorous safety testing prior  to being approved by the FDA and are continually monitored for safety.  All vaccine ingredients are tested to be safe. Vaccines are also studied to be administered together, to work in conjunction to safely prompt your child's immune sytem to build protection.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in most cases vaccine side effects are minor and go away within a few days. Side effects vary according to vaccine type, but generally mild side effects may include:\nParents should keep an eye out for any unusual condition, such as a high fever, weakness, or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heartbeat or dizziness. In the unlikely case that your child experiences signs of allergic reaction or a side effect, you should contact your doctor immediately.\nWhile serious side effects are rare, parents are encouraged to report any severe side effects to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) which serves to report, analyze and make incidences of adverse side effects available to the public.\n","107":"  1.

They result in 250,000 - 500,000\u00c2\u00a0deaths, and about 3-5\u00c2\u00a0million cases of severe illness each year worldwide, with 5-15\u00c2\u00a0% of the total population becoming infected (WHO 2003). Today, we have the capability to produce 300\u00c2\u00a0million doses of trivalent vaccine per year - enough for current epidemics in the Western world, but insufficient for coping with a pandemic (Fedson 2005).\nThe influenza vaccine is effective in preventing disease and death, especially in high risk groups, and in the context of routine vaccination, the World Health Organization reports that the \"influenza vaccine is the most effective preventive measure available\" (WHO 2005e). With regard to the present fear of an imminent influenza pandemic, \"Vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs are two of the most important response measures for reducing morbidity and mortality during a pandemic.\" (WHO 2005d).\nThe concept of vaccination was practiced in ancient China, where pus from smallpox patients was inoculated onto healthy people in order to prevent naturally acquired smallpox. This concept was introduced into Europe in the early 18th century, and in 1796, Edward Jenner did his first human experiments using cowpox to vaccinate (vacca is Latin for cow) against smallpox. In 1931, viral growth in embryonated hens' eggs was discovered, and in the 1940s, the US military developed the first approved inactivated vaccines for influenza, which were used in the Second World War (Baker 2002, Hilleman 2000). Greater advances were made in vaccinology and immunology, and vaccines became safer and mass-produced. Today, thanks to the advances of molecular technology, we are on the verge of making influenza vaccines through the genetic manipulation of influenza genes (Couch 1997, Hilleman 2002).\nAll vaccines in general use today are derived from viruses grown in hens' eggs, and contain 15\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00ce\u00bcg of antigen from each of the three strains selected for that year's vaccine - two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one influenza B strain. From the selection of the strains to be used in the vaccine, all the way to the final vaccine, is a lengthy process that may take up to 6-8\u00c2\u00a0months. \nThroughout the year, 110\u00c2\u00a0national influenza surveillance centres and 4\u00c2\u00a0WHO collaboration centres in 82\u00c2\u00a0countries around the world watch the trends in circulating strains of influenza. Genetic data is collected, and mutations identified. The WHO identifies the strains that are likely to most resemble the strains in circulation during the next year's winter seasons, and this information is shared with vaccine producers, who begin preparation for vaccine production.\nThis decision is made each year in February for the following northern hemisphere winter and September for the following southern hemisphere winter. Details of the planned February 2006 meeting can be seen on the WHO website (WHO 2005k).\nFor the northern hemisphere winter season from the end of 2004 to the beginning of 2005, the recommendations were as follows (WHO 2005h-i):\nan A\/New Caledonia\/20\/99(H1N1)-like virus \nan A\/Fujian\/411\/2002(H3N2)-like virus\na B\/Shanghai\/361\/2002-like virus\nFor the southern hemisphere winter season of mid-2005, the recommendations were:\nan A\/New Caledonia\/20\/99(H1N1)-like virus\nan A\/Wellington\/1\/2004(H3N2)-like virus\na B\/Shanghai\/361\/2002-like virus\nFor the northern hemisphere winter season of 2005-2006, the recommendations are:\nan A\/New Caledonia\/20\/99(H1N1)-like virus \nan A\/California\/7\/2004(H3N2)-like virus\na B\/Shanghai\/361\/2002-like virus\nFor the southern hemisphere winter season of mid-2005, the recommendations are:\nan A\/New Caledonia\/20\/99(H1N1)-like virus\nan A\/California\/7\/2004(H3N2)-like virus\na B\/Malaysia\/2506\/2004-like virus\nFor example, A\/New Caledonia\/20\/99(H1N1) means that it is an influenza A, type H1N1, the 20th isolate from New Caledonia in 1999. One can see that the H1N1 influenza A in the vaccine still represents the circulating strain, while the H3N2 virus has changed over time. Obviously, A\/Fujian\/411\/2002 was not a good prediction in 2004. As a matter of fact, the rate of vaccine failure was unusually high during the winter season 2004\/2005.\nShortly after the WHO announces the anticipated circulating strains for the coming season, vaccine manufacturers start making the new vaccine strain. If the strain chosen to be represented in the vaccine is the same as that used in the previous vaccine, the process is faster.\nFirst, the CDC, or other reference source, take the strains to be used and grow them in combination with a strain called PR8 (H1N1 A\/PR\/8\/34) which is attenuated so that it is apathogenic and unable to replicate in humans (Beare 1975, Neumann 2005). This allows reassortment to occur, resulting in a virus containing six PR8 genes along with the haemagglutanin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of the seasonal strain. This new virus is then incubated in embryonated hens' eggs for 2-3\u00c2\u00a0days, after which the allantoic fluid is harvested, and the virus particles are centrifuged in a solution of increasing density to concentrate and purify them at a specific density. Then,\n the viruses are inactivated using formaldehyde or \u00ce\u00b2-propiolactone, disrupted with detergent, and the HA and NA are purified. Finally, the concentrations are standardized by the amount of haemagglutination that occurs (Hilleman 2002, Potter 2004, Treanor 2004). \nIn about June\/July, the strains are tested to ensure adequate yield, purity, and potency. After this, the three strains - two influenza A strains and one influenza B strain, which were all produced separately - are combined into one vaccine, their content verified, and packaged into syringes for distribution.\nAt present, the world has a production capacity of about 300\u00c2\u00a0million trivalent influenza vaccines per year, most of which is produced in nine countries - Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 2003, only 79\u00c2\u00a0million doses were used outside of these countries and Western Europe. A further 13.8\u00c2\u00a0million vaccines were produced and used locally in Hungary, Romania, and Russia (Fedson 2005).\nApproximately 4-5\u00c2\u00a0million doses of the live attenuated virus vaccine are produced per year.\nThe different types of vaccines in use today for influenza can be divided into killed virus vaccines and live virus vaccines. Other vaccines of these two types are under development, as well as some that do not fall into either category, where a degree of genetic manipulation is involved.\nKilled virus vaccines can be divided into whole virus vaccines, and split or subunit vaccines.\nWhole virus vaccines were the first to be developed. The influenza virus was grown in the allantoic sac of embryonated hens' eggs, subsequently purified and concentrated using red blood cells, and finally,\n inactivated using formaldehyde or \u00ce\u00b2-propiolactone. Later, this method of purification and concentration was replaced with centrifuge purification, and then by density gradient centrifugation, where virus particles of a specific density precipitate at a certain level in a solution of increasing density. Subsequently, filter-membrane purification was added to the methods available for purification\/concentration (Hilleman 2002, Potter 2004). \nWhole virus vaccines are safe and well tolerated, with an efficacy of 60-90\u00c2\u00a0% in children and adults.\nSplit vaccines are produced in the same way as whole virus vaccines, but virus particles are disrupted using detergents, or, in the past, ether.\nSubunit vaccines consist of purified HA and NA proteins, with the other viral components removed. Split and subunit vaccines cause fewer local reactions than whole virus vaccines, and a single dose produces adequate antibody levels in a population exposed to similar viruses (Couch 1997, Hilleman 2002, Potter 2004). However, this might not be sufficient if a novel pandemic influenza virus emerges, and it is believed that two doses will be required.\nInactivated influenza virus vaccines are generally administered intramuscularly, although intradermal (Belshe 2004, Cooper 2004, Kenney 2004) and intranasal (mucosal) routes (Langley 2005) are being investigated.\nCold-adapted live attenuated influenza virus (CAIV) vaccines, for intranasal administration, have been available in the USA since July 2003, and in the former Soviet Union, live attenuated influenza vaccines have been in use for several years. The vaccine consists of a master attenuated virus into which the HA and NA genes have been inserted. The master viruses used are A\/Ann Arbor\/6\/60 (H2N2) and B\/Ann Arbor\/1\/66 (Hoffman 2005, Palese 1997, Potter 2004). The vaccine master virus is cold-adapted - in other words, it has been adapted to grow ideally at 25\u00c2\u00a0degrees Celsius, which means that at normal human body temperature, it is attenuated. The adaptation process has been shown to have caused stable mutations in the three polymerase genes of the virus, namely PA, PB1, and PB2 (Hilleman 2002, Potter 2004).\nThe advantages of a live virus vaccine applied to the nasal mucosa are the development of local neutralising immunity, the development of a cell-mediated immune response, and a cross-reactive and longer lasting immune response (Couch 1997).\nOf concern in the CAIV vaccine, is the use in immunocompromised patients (safety\u00c2\u00a0?) and the possible interference between viral strains present in the vaccine which might result in decreased effectiveness. Damage to mucosal surfaces, while far less than with wild-type virulent influenza viruses, may lead to susceptibility to secondary infections. Safety issues, however, do not seem to be a problem in immunocompetent individuals. Of greater concern for the future is the possibility of genetic reversion - where the mutations causing attenuation change back to their wild-type state - and reassortment with wild-type influenza viruses, resulting in a new strain. However, studies done to test for this have not detected problems so far (Youngner 1994).\nIt is hoped that cell culture, using Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) or Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells approved for human vaccine production, may eventually replace the use of hens' eggs, resulting in a greater production capacity, and a less labor-intensive culturing process. However, setting up such a facility takes time and is costly, and most vaccine producers are only now beginning this process.\nReverse genetics allows for specific manipulation of the influenza genome, exchanging genome segments for those desired (Palase 1997, Palese 2002b). Based on this method, several plasmid-based methods (Neumann 2005) for constructing new viruses for vaccines have been developed, but are not yet in use commercially. A number of plasmids, small circular pieces of DNA, containing the genes and promoter regions of the influenza virus, are transfected into cells, which are then capable of producing the viral genome segments and proteins to form a new viral particle. If this method could be used on a larger scale, it may simplify and speed up the development of new vaccines - instead of the cumbersome task, for the live attenuated vaccines, of allowing reassortment in eggs, and then searching for the correct reassortment (6 genes from the vaccine master strain, and HA and NA from the selected strain for the new vaccine), the vaccine producers could simply insert the HA and NA genes into a plasmid.\nDNA vaccines have been tested for a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens. The principle upon which the vaccine works is inoculation with DNA, which is taken up by antigen presenting cells, allowing them to produce viral proteins in their cytosol. These are then detected by the immune system, resulting in both a humoral and cellular immune response (Hilleman 2002).\nVaccines to conserved proteins have been considered, and among the candidates are the M2 and the NP proteins. It is hoped that, by producing immunity to conserved proteins, i.e. proteins that do not undergo antigenic change like HA and NA do, a vaccine can be produced that does not need to be \"reinvented\" each year. This is also on the WHO's agenda for a pandemic vaccine (Couch 2005). Such vaccines have been shown to be effective in laboratory animals, but data are not available for human studies. \"Generic\" HA-based vaccines, aimed at conserved areas in the protein, are also being considered (Palese 2002b).\nAdjuvants have been used in a number of vaccines against other pathogens, and are being investigated for a role in influenza vaccines. The purpose of adjuvants is to increase the immune response to the vaccine, thus allowing either a decrease in antigen dose, a greater efficacy, or both. Alum is the only adjuvant registered in the United States, and MF59, an oil\/water emulsion, has been used in influenza vaccines in Europe since 1997 (Wadman 2005). A vaccine using the outer membrane proteins of Neisseria meningitidis as an adjuvant has shown success in early clinical trials (Langley 2005).\nAttenuation by deletion of the gene NS1\n or decreasing the activity of NS1 is being investigated. NS1 produces a protein that inhibits the function of interferon alpha (IFN\u00ce\u00b1). If a wild-type influenza virus infects a person, the NS1 protein antagonises IFN\u00ce\u00b1, which has an antiviral effect. An infection with a NS1-deficient virus would quickly be overcome by the immune system, hopefully resulting in an immune response, but with no symptoms (Palese 2002b). \nReplication-defective influenza viruses can be made by deleting the M2 or the NS2 genes (Hilleman 2002, Palese 2002b). Only a single round of replication can occur, with termination before the formation of infectious viral particles. Protein expression will result in an immune response, and there is no danger of infection spreading to other cells or people.\nAntibody response, determined by measuring haemagglutination inhibition titers, is used as a serological marker of the immunological response to the vaccine, or efficacy. In persons primed by previous exposure to viruses of the same subtype, antibody response is similar for the various types of vaccines. However, in persons without such previous exposure (either through vaccination or through natural infection), response is poorer in the split and subunit vaccines, where two doses are  required.\nIn healthy primed adults, efficacy after one dose ranges from 80-100\u00c2\u00a0%, while in unprimed adults, efficacy enters into this range after two doses. In other populations, efficacy is lower:\n*adapted from Pirofzki 1998, Potter 2004, Musana 2004\nEffectiveness, usually defined by prevention of illness, is generally slightly lower, with 70-90\u00c2\u00a0% effectiveness in children and healthy adults under the age of 65. In those above 65\u00c2\u00a0years of age, a lower rate of 30-40\u00c2\u00a0% is seen. However, the vaccine is 20-80\u00c2\u00a0% effective in preventing death from influenza in persons older than 65\u00c2\u00a0years, with revaccination each year reducing mortality risk more than a single vaccination (Govaert 1994, Gross 1995, Nichol 1994, Partriarca 1985, Voordouw 2004). In patients with previous myocardial infarctions (MI), a study by Gurfinkel et al. (2004) showed a reduction in the one year risk of death (6\u00c2\u00a0% in the vaccinated group, 13\u00c2\u00a0% in the control group) and combination of death, repeat MI, or rehospitalisation (22\u00c2\u00a0% versus 37\u00c2\u00a0%), possibly due to a non-specific effect of immune responsiveness. Further studies are planned to evaluate the impact of influenza vaccination on acute coronary syndromes.\nVaccination of caregivers against influenza also reduces the exposure of vulnerable populations to influenza.\nStudies have been done on effectiveness in terms of health benefits and cost in several healthy populations (Bridges 2000, Langley 2004, Monto 2000, Wilde 1999). They suggest that, while individual health benefits from vaccination certainly exist, as do reductions in days absent from work, vaccinating healthy working adults may not provide cost savings when compared to loss of productivity and days taken off due to illness. Vaccinating health care professionals is recommended, not only because of health benefits and reduced days absent from work, but because it is believed that hospital employees tend to report to work in spite of having an acute febrile illness. Previous studies have shown that vaccinating health care professionals reduces nursing home and hospital-acquired influenza infections (Pachuki 1989, Potter 1997).\nGuillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 Syndrome is seen as the most dangerous side effect of influenza vaccines, aside from manifestations of egg allergy. It is, however, rare: the annual reporting rate decreased from a high of 0.17 per 100,000 vaccinees in 1993-1994 to 0.04 in 2002-2003 (Haber 2005).\nThe most frequent side effects are pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site (10-64\u00c2\u00a0%) lasting 1-2\u00c2\u00a0days, and systemic side effects such as headache, fever, malaise, and myalgia in about 5\u00c2\u00a0% of vaccinees (Belshe 2005, Musana 2004, Potter 2004). These side effects are largely due to a local immune response, with interferon production leading to systemic effects. Local side effects are more common with whole virus vaccines than subunit or split vaccines, and also more common with intradermal vaccination than intramuscular vaccination.\nSince the inactivated vaccines do not contain live virus, they cannot cause influenza infection - often respiratory illness is incorrectly attributed to influenza vaccination. Live attenuated virus vaccines do contain live virus; however, side effects are rare, with a runny nose, congestion, sore throat, and headache being the most commonly reported symptoms, with occasional abdominal pain, vomiting, and myalgia (Musana 2004). They are not recommended for use in children below the age of 5\u00c2\u00a0years, although a study by Piedra et al. (Piedra 2005) showed safety in children above the age of 18\u00c2\u00a0months. Controversies have arisen around the possibility of exacerbated asthma in children between 18-34\u00c2\u00a0months of age (Bergen 2004, Black 2004, Glezen 2004). It should be noted, however, that these vaccines should be avoided in immunocompromized patients.\nThe primary groups to be targeted for vaccination can be memorized with an easy mnemonic - FLU-A (Musana 2004).\nF - facilities such as nursing homes or chronic care facilities.\nL - likelihood of transmission to high risk persons - healthcare workers and care providers can transmit influenza to patients, as can other employees in institutions serving the high risk population groups, as well as people living with individuals at high risk.\nU - underlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic heart or lung disease, pregnancy, cancer, immunodeficiency, renal disease, organ transplant recipients, and others.\nA - age >\u00c2\u00a065\u00c2\u00a0years, or between 6-23\u00c2\u00a0months of age\nSince the risk of influenza rises linearly from the age of 50\u00c2\u00a0years, some promote the vaccination of those aged between 50 and 64 in addition to those above 65\u00c2\u00a0years of age. In a study of health professional attitudes to such a policy in England, both sides were equally divided (Joseph 2005). Vaccination for those above 50\u00c2\u00a0years of age is recommended in the USA, while all those above 6\u00c2\u00a0months are offered vaccination in Canada.\nIn the era of a potentially pending pandemic, other groups also have importance for targeting - poultry workers in the Far East are being vaccinated to prevent infection with circulating human influenza strains. This vaccine will not protect against avian influenza strains, but will help prevent dual infection, if infection with avian influenza does occur, thereby reducing opportunities for reassortment of two strains in one human host. For the same reason, travelers to areas where avian influenza is present are advised to be vaccinated against human influenza (Beigel 2005).\nThe World Health Organisation makes the following recommendations on who should receive influenza vaccines (WHO 2005b-c, WHO 2005f): \nResidents of institutions for elderly people and the disabled.\nElderly, non-institutionalized individuals with chronic heart or lung diseases, metabolic or renal disease, or immunodeficiencies.\nAll individuals >\u00c2\u00a06\u00c2\u00a0months of age with any of the conditions listed above.\nElderly individuals above a nationally defined age limit, irrespective of other risk factors.\nOther groups defined on the basis of national data and capacities, such as contacts of high-risk people, pregnant women, healthcare workers and others with key functions in society, as well as children aged 6-23\u00c2\u00a0months.\nThe CDC guidelines are similar, with a few additions (Harper 2004, CDC 2005) - \nResidents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities\nPersons aged 2-64\u00c2\u00a0years with underlying chronic medical conditions\nAll children aged 6-23\u00c2\u00a0months\nAdults aged >\u00c2\u00a065\u00c2\u00a0years - high risk\nAdults aged >\u00c2\u00a050\u00c2\u00a0years - recommended\nAll women who will be pregnant during the influenza season\nChildren aged 6\u00c2\u00a0months - 18\u00c2\u00a0years on chronic aspirin therapy\nHealthcare workers involved in direct patient care\nOut-of-home caregivers and household contacts of children aged\u00c2\u00a00-23 months\nSouth Africa has the following guidelines (summarised from Schoub 2005), dividing the population into 4 groups who may receive the vaccine -\nCategory 1 - At risk persons (i.e. at risk for complications of influenza)\nCategory 2 - Contacts of high-risk persons - healthcare workers, caregivers of the elderly and high-risk patients, and persons living with high risk persons.\nCategory 3 - Workplace vaccination.\nCategory 4 - Personal protection.\nAustralian guidelines (Hall 2002) -\nEveryone 65\u00c2\u00a0years of age and older\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people 50\u00c2\u00a0years of age and older\nPeople six months of age and older with chronic illnesses requiring regular medical follow-up or hospitalisation in the previous year\nPeople six months of age and older with chronic illnesses of the pulmonary or circulatory systems (except asthma)\nResidents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities\nChildren and teenagers aged six months to 18\u00c2\u00a0years on long-term aspirin therapy (because aspirin treatment puts them at risk of Reye's syndrome if they develop a fever)\nHealthcare and other workers providing care to the high-risk groups above.\nOther groups for whom influenza immunisation should be considered include pregnant women, overseas travelers and persons infected with HIV.\nMost countries with guidelines will have similar recommendations. Canada, although having similar recommendations for priority groups, actively encourages vaccination of everyone above the age of 6 months (Orr 2004).\nIf a pandemic becomes a reality, recommendations will likely extend to everyone. However, frontline workers such as healthcare personnel, as well as police forces and military personnel, might be high priority targets.\nContraindications to influenza vaccination are:\negg allergy - the vaccines are made in eggs, and, although rare, severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis can occur.\nacute febrile illness - vaccination should be delayed. Minor illnesses such as mild upper respiratory tract infections or allergic rhinitis are not contraindications.\nfirst trimester of pregnancy has in the past been seen as a contraindication. However, the ACIP recommendations changed in 2004, and currently the guidelines say that vaccination can occur in any trimester (Bettes 2005, Harper 2004).\nprevious Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome has in the past been considered as a contraindication, but this is now no longer a contraindication for the use of inactivated vaccine. (Fleming 2005).\nContraindications to vaccination with live attenuated vaccine are (Medimmune 2005):\nage <\u00c2\u00a05 or >\u00c2\u00a065\u00c2\u00a0years. \nimmunocompromised patients - the use of the live-attenuated vaccine is contraindicated, and inactivated vaccines should be used instead. Caution should be used when giving the vaccine to those who may come into contact with immunocompromised patients, as this caused controversy in 2004 when vaccine supplies were limited (Manion 2005).  HIV-infected individuals may not have significant immune suppression in the early years of their HIV infection, and it is accepted that certain live attenuated vaccines, such as those for measles and varicella, can be used in these patients. Little information is available on the use of live attenuated influenza vaccine in HIV-infected people, but what is available suggests that this vaccine is safe in adults who are in the CDC class A1-2, and in children who are in the CDC class N1-2 or A1-2, i.e. asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, with CD4 counts higher than 200\/\u00c2\u00b5l in adults (King 2000, King 2001). Both studies conclude that inadvertent vaccination or exposure to the attenuated virus is unlikely to result in significant adverse effects. However, it should be noted that small numbers of patients were involved, and until sufficient data are obtained, extreme caution should be exercised.\nprevious Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome.\nchildren under the age of 18\u00c2\u00a0years who are receiving aspirin therapy should not receive live vaccine, as it is a risk for Reye's syndrome.

All others are inactivated.\nSeveral methods of reducing the amount of antigen in vaccine preparations have been investigated. Most importantly are the use of adjuvants and the exploitation of a part of the immune system designed to elicit an immune response - dendritic cells.\nAdjuvants are used in a number of vaccines in current use, such as those for Diphtheria\/Tetanus\/Pertussis (DtaP) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hib). Examples of adjuvants include alum (a combination of aluminum compounds), liposomes, emulsions such as MF59, Neisseria meningitidis capsule proteins, immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMs), and interleukin-2. They enhance the immune response to a vaccine, allowing a lower dose to be given, while maintaining sufficient protective response (Couch 1997, Langley 2005, Potter 2004).\nDendritic cells can be exploited by giving vaccines intradermally, as they induce T\u00c2\u00a0cell responses, as well as T\u00c2\u00a0cell dependent antibody formation (La Montagne 2004, Steinman 2002). Intradermal vaccination is well established with hepatitis B and rabies vaccines, and has recently been investigated with considerable success for influenza vaccines (and in a study from 1948 (Weller 2005). 40\u00c2\u00a0%, 20\u00c2\u00a0%, and 10\u00c2\u00a0% of the standard intramuscular dose of 15\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00ce\u00bcg antigen given intradermally produces a response similar to the full dose given intramuscularly (Belshe 2004, Cooper 2004, Kenney 2004). While the antibody titre is protective, the levels may not be as durable as those induced by intramuscular vaccination. Subjects over the age of 60\u00c2\u00a0years seem to have a weaker immune response with the intradermal vaccination, and it is likely that the intramuscular injection will be preferable in this group (Belshe 2004). Also not clear yet, is the dose-response relationship between intramuscular and intradermal routes (Kilbourne 2005). Further studies will clarify these matters. One drawback is that the local reactions can be more intense, with increased pain, swelling, and redness; however, these are still mild. \nIn the event of a shortage of vaccine, as happened in the 2004\/5 influenza season, as well as in the event of a pandemic situation, certain individuals, such as those working in the healthcare sector and in the poultry industry, and those exposed on the front lines, will need to be given priority over other groups for access to vaccines. As has happened in the past, leaders may have identify groups for urgent vaccination in order to allow for maximum functioning of essential services, while other groups may have to wait until a greater supply is available (MacReady 2005, Treanor 2004). In the event of a pandemic, this could become problematic, but recent experience in the 2004\/5 shortage showed that it was managed well by most (Lee 2004), with some instances of companies buying up vaccine, leaving private practices and public health services without supply (MacReady 2005). In the UK, there have already been debates about who should get the H5N1 pandemic vaccine first - healthcare workers, or poultry workers - if H5N1 avian influenza were to reach Britain (Day 2005).\nThe purpose of this section is not to be an exhaustive reference on avian influenza vaccine development. That is a rapidly advancing field, and the achievements of those involved will likely change the face of influenza vaccinology, and vaccinology in general. In 10\u00c2\u00a0years from now, it is likely that we will look back on our current influenza vaccines and think of them as primitive. Details and advances noted now will be outdated tomorrow. This section will provide an outline of the current direction, the problems we face at the moment, and where we can hope to be in the near future.\nAs we have seen, vaccination against influenza is a crucial weapon, not only in our fight against seasonal influenza, but against a pandemic that may come tomorrow, next year, or in the next decade. We need to prepare ourselves now.\nThe World Health Organisation is working with leaders of countries and vaccine manufacturers around the world to prepare for the pandemic many fear will arise out of the current H5N1 avian influenza scare (WHO 2005g).\nAlthough it is an ongoing process, initial strains of H5 avian influenza, such as A\/Duck\/Singapore\/97 (H5N3), have been identified for use in vaccine development (Stephenson 2005). However, it should be noted that the focus is not solely on H5 strains - H2, H6, H7, and H9 are not being ignored, although only H1, H2, H3, N1 and N2 have been found in human influenza viruses (Kilbourne 1997).\nOur most urgent needs are a) a stockpile of anti-influenza drugs, b) a vaccine that matches the pandemic strain, c) expedited testing and approval of this vaccine, and d) the capacity to mass-produce enough vaccine to provide the world with a good defense. At present, all of these are still in their infancy.\nA matching vaccine will require knowledge of the pandemic strain, and until the next pandemic begins, we will not know for certain what that strain will be. Current efforts are working with a number of strains, mostly H5 strains, as this seems to be the most likely origin at the present time.\nThe technology to rapidly develop such a vaccine needs to be fully developed. At present, there are several methods being used to develop candidate vaccines.\nCell culture systems, using Vero or MDCK cell lines, are in development, and will increase our production capacity. The cells could be grown on microcarriers - glass beads - to enable high volume culture (Osterholm 2005). However, these will take several years to put in place, and the cost is problematic (Fedson 2005).\nReverse genetics is being used to design candidate vaccines - for example, H5N1 virulence genes have been removed from a laboratory strain. Attenuating the virulence of the virus is important, considering the increased mortality rate of the current highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza when it does enter human hosts. While the H5N1 mortality rate in humans at present doesn't necessarily reflect the mortality rate in an eventual pandemic, serious attention must be paid to the pathogenicity of the current H5N1 strain before it can be used in a vaccine.\nPlasmid systems are in development - several exist, and others are being described in the scientific literature. A generic influenza virus would supply 6 genes in plasmid form, and once the pandemic strain is identified, it would supply the HA and NA genes. DNA vaccine development experiencing a limited success.\nApathogenic H5N3 with an adjuvant is being tested - the immune response will be against the H5 only, but the important aspect here is the use of an attenuated strain (Horimoto 2001).\nLive attenuated cold adapted virus is being considered. This may open even more doors for potential reassortment, however, and it may take considerable time to demonstrate safety in certain populations, such as the elderly and children.\nH5N2 inactivated vaccines exist for poultry, and appeared to be protective against H5N1 from 2002 and 2004, but it is expected that human vaccines will have to be better matched than poultry vaccines (Lipatov 2004).\nIn order to ensure that, when the time comes, a vaccine can be rapidly produced, tested, and shown to be safe, immunogenic, and protective, the WHO has asked vaccine manufacturers and scientists to start developing new vaccines based on strains that may be related to an eventual pandemic strain. These vaccines will likely never be used, and are being developed to demonstrate that when the actual pandemic vaccine is needed, the principle is sound, and the technology is in place and proven on previous vaccines - hence the term \"mock vaccine\". The important aspect is the development of established vaccines that do not need lengthy studies before they can enter the market. They need to contain viral antigens humans have not had previous exposure to, such as the H5N1 antigens, and companies need to take them through clinical trials to determine immunogenicity, dose, and safety, and ultimately be licensed for use in the same stringent procedures used for other vaccines.\nCurrently, an expedited system is in place for the inactivated influenza vaccines against seasonal human influenza - the whole process, from the identification of the strains to be used, to the injection in the consultation room, takes about 6-8\u00c2\u00a0months, because the vaccine is an established one, and only certain aspects need to be confirmed prior to release. This same system needs to be in place for a pandemic vaccine (Fedson 2005, WHO 2004a-b).\nIn an ideal world, 12\u00c2\u00a0billion doses of monovalent vaccine would be available in order to administer two doses of vaccine to every living human being.\nThe reality is that we do not have this much available.\nCurrently, the world's vaccine production capacity is for 300\u00c2\u00a0million doses of trivalent vaccine per year. This amounts to 900\u00c2\u00a0million doses of monovalent vaccine, if all production were shifted to make a pandemic vaccine. Considering that at least two doses will be needed, the current capacity serves to provide for only 450\u00c2\u00a0million people. This is further complicated by the fact that the dose of antigen that will be required is not yet known, but studies indicate that it may be higher than current human influenza vaccines (Fedson 2005).\nThe world has suffered from vaccine shortages before - recently in the 2004\/5 winter season, and closer to the threatening situation, in the pandemic of 1968. Furthermore, many countries do not have their own production facilities, and will rely on those countries that do. Will those countries be able to share vaccine supplies?\nOsterholm asks (Osterholm 2005), \"What if the pandemic were to start \u0085\"\ntonight\nwithin a year\nin ten years?\nThe New England Journal of Medicine had an interview with Dr Osterholm, which is available online for listening to or for downloading:\n http:\/\/content.nejm.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/352\/18\/1839\/DC1\nIf the pandemic were to start now, we would have to rely on non-vaccine measures for at least the first 6\u00c2\u00a0months of the pandemic, and even then, the volumes produced would not be sufficient for everyone, and some sort of rationing or triage system would be necessary. Vaccine and drug production would have to be escalated - for much later in the pandemic, as this will not make a difference in the short term. The world's healthcare system would have to plan well in order to cope with distribution when they become available - at present, it is doubted that it could handle the distribution and administration of the vaccines, never mind trying to handle that under the pressure placed on it by a pandemic. Vaccines may only be available for the second wave of the pandemic, which tends to have a higher mortality than the initial wave.\nIf the pandemic starts in a year's time, it is likely that we will then have some experience in developing mock vaccines, so that a vaccine could be produced relatively quickly using a variety of the technologies currently under investigation. There would still be a significant delay, and it is likely that there would still be insufficient quantities, with rationing required.\nWe don't know when a pandemic will occur - but starting preparation now is essential. If the pandemic is delayed by a few years, we may well have the required vaccine production capacity to minimise the disastrous consequences.\nThe WHO suggests various strategies to solve these problems (WHO 2005d) and is working with governments, scientists, vaccine and drug companies, and other role players around the world to achieve a solution.\nShorten the time between emergence of a pandemic virus and the start of commercial production.\nA number of controversies surrounding the development of a new influenza vaccine need to be dealt with (Fedson 2005, Osterholm 2005).\nFinancial - patents exist for the plasmid-based methods of making virus in cell culture and the legal implications in various countries need to be examined and addressed. Will the owners of the intellectual property benefit in any way? Mock vaccines need to be made, but will probably never be sold and used. Who will fund this endeavour?\nRationing - in the event of vaccine shortage, higher risk groups will need vaccination first, along with those working on the front lines to control the pandemic. In such an event, the definition of \"high risk group\" may need to be revised - will it include children, for instance? Who will get the vaccine first - there is already tension over this issue in the UK: poultry farmers or healthcare workers? (Day 2005)\nEquitable access will need to be ensured - countries without vaccine production, poorer countries, and developing countries will all want to have their share of the vaccine supply.\nLiability issues - due to increased vaccination with current vaccines, greater attention must be paid to liability. Several countries have legislation that limits and\/or covers certain liability for vaccine companies - encouraging such legislation will make vaccine companies feel more free to develop new vaccines, and increase the supply of current vaccines. When the time comes for rapid entry of pandemic vaccines into general use, such legislation will be important.\nBarnett employs a Haddon Matrix to show what sort of planning needs to be done at different stages of the pandemic, from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic (Barnett 2005).\nThe WHO will play an important role in the process. In 2001, the Global Agenda for Influenza Surveillance and Control was established (Webby 2003, Stohr 2005). Its role is to enhance our surveillance abilities, in order to better detect a pandemic, and prepare for influenza seasons until then. It is also charged with the task of increasing our knowledge of influenza, and enhancing vaccine acceptance and use, in order to prepare us for a pandemic (WHO 2005j).\nThe WHO also needs to lead the address of the problems of production capacity, legislation and expedited vaccine availability, and research that needs to be done in order to reach the point where these are possible. It needs to help solve the controversies over financing, patents and intellectual property, equity for developing countries and countries not producing vaccine, and rationing of vaccine when supplies do not meet the demands of a population of more than 6\u00c2\u00a0billion people.\n\"Our goal should be to develop a new cell culture-based vaccine that includes antigens that are present in all subtypes of influenza virus, that do not change from year to year, and that can be made available to the entire world population. We need an international approach to public funding that will pay for the excess production capacity required during a pandemic.\" (Osterholm 2005)\n \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Design:  \n","108":"For many years, the US government and mainstream media have continued to blame the unvaccinated community for the spread of infectious disease. We are constantly being bombarded with statements like the one written by Philip Ross and published in the International Business Times, which stated:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The American classroom has become a battleground for parents who are threatened by the growing number of children not vaccinated against measles, one of the most highly contagious viruses in the world. The ongoing measles outbreak in the U.S. that started at Disneyland and has spread to 14 states has raised concerns over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rising anti-vaccination movement, including whether the decision to vaccinate against such a dangerous disease should be left to parents, and what constitutes responsible childrearing. Should a child whose parents chose not to vaccinate be allowed to share the same pencils and playground as children whose parents did?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAlthough the International Business Times had attempted to present the public with a balanced review of the situation facing parents, it is questionable as to whether they presented any real evidence to support their claims and they left many readers with unanswered questions.\nIn 2011, a team of scientists headed by Duane L. Pierson published the paper\u00c2\u00a0Varicella Zoster Virus DNA at Inoculation Sites and in Saliva After Zostavax Immunization .\nTheir paper discusses whether or not individuals vaccinated with the shingles vaccine can remain infectious with the chicken pox virus after they had been vaccinated. To investigate this concern in more detail, the team studied 36 individuals over the age of 60 who had recently been vaccinated with the shingles vaccine, Zostavax. The scientists discovered that although the vaccine was efficient in reducing the incidence of shingles in the elderly, many of the skin and saliva samples tested positive for the varicella zoster virus (VZV) DNA for up to 28 days after vaccination.\nNote: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus. Primary infection usually causes varicella (chicken pox) in children.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inoculation site samples taken within 10 minutes after vaccination were positive for Zostavax VZV DNA in 18 (50%) of 36 subjects. The VZV DNA copy number per nanogram of total DNA ranged from 28 to 2.1 \u00c3\u2014 106 (Table 1), possibly reflecting the presence of infectious virus since no alcohol or other agent was used to wipe the skin after inoculation.\nNo saliva specimen collected immediately before immunization contained VZV DNA. During the first week after immunization, VZV DNA was detected in saliva of 21 (58%) of 36 subjects (13 men and 8 women). During the 28-day study period, VZV DNA was found in 11 (31%) of 36 subjects (5 men and 6 women) at day 14, in 10 (28%) of 36 subjects (6 men and 4 women) at day 21, and in 2 (6%) of 36 subjects (1 man and 1 woman) at day 28.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIn other words, within ten minutes of being vaccinated with the shingles vaccine, Zostavax, fifty percent of those who had taken part in the study had skin samples testing positive for Zostavax VZV DNA, and could potentially infect unvaccinated individuals with chicken pox.\nThis paper is just one of many proving that it is the vaccinated who put others at risk, not the other way around.

D. Heyes\n Natural News \n August 19, 2013\nIn July, the state of Missouri began offering for free a vaccine aimed at preventing, among other ailments, whooping cough. According to officials, the TDap vaccine, which reportedly prevents tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, was necessary because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153of the rising incidence of whooping cough is reported to be related to the vaccine wearing off if given more than ten years earlier,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says an online report.\nCiting a St. Louis Post Dispatch article, Michelle Goldstein of VacTruth.com says some 41,000 cases of pertussis occurred in the U.S. in 2012, compared to less than 19,000 cases in the previous year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thus the need for the new vaccine.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The news story emphasized that whooping cough is highly dangerous and can lead to vomiting and death, especially in children. The report indicates that diphtheria is a bacterial disease that is highly contagious and can also lead to death,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goldstein writes, adding that tetanus can cause severe muscle spasms.\nNatural remedies, treatments can work without risk\nWhat the paper failed to report, however, is that there are serious health risks associated with the Tdap vaccines. Also, there are relatively benign health implications that are commonly associated with the diseases the vaccine is intended to prevent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153along with the important fact that vaccines have never been proven to prevent any disease,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goldstein said.\nShe adds:\nThe risks that whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus pose to health are low compared to the potential, serious dangers reported as a result of this vaccine. Whooping cough can be treated successfully through a vitamin C protocol developed by Dr. Suzanne Humphries which has been shown to greatly reduce symptoms. In contrast, antibiotic treatments, given routinely by conventional, allopathic physicians to treat whooping cough, have never been shown to positively impact the course of the illness.\nWhatever the standard medical treatments, most people fully recover from whooping cough, which then gives them lifetime immunity from it. If they should become re-infected, Goldstein writes, subsequent episodes are generally \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quite mild.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nMeanwhile, tetanus can be prevented in a number of ways without ever receiving a vaccine. For instance, simply thoroughly washing and cleaning cuts can prevent the disease. And in actuality, contracting the disease in the first place is rare; just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153233 cases of tetanus were reported to the Center for Disease Control between 2001 and 2008,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goldstein points out, citing the federal agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own figures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The incidence of tetanus declined by more than 95% between 1947 and 2008.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nFinally, diphtheria is also a low-risk disease, and one that is not seen widely in the U.S. since an outbreak in the 1970s. Over the 30-year period between 1980 and 2010, just 55 cases of the disease were reported to the CDC.\nVaccine dangers outweigh risk of actually getting the disease\nhe dangers of getting a Tdap vaccine can also be significant. According to Goldstein:\nHealth consequences resulting from the Tdap vaccine include encephalitis, brain damage and death. A comprehensive report made by the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) documents clearly the widespread health dangers associated with the Tdap vaccine. Tdap and DTap vaccines are currently used in the United States, replacing the DTP vaccine in 1996, but all three vaccines contain the dangerous pertussis toxin with unsafe additives.\nFurthermore, experts note, the fact that whooping cough even occurs in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccinated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd populations is a sign that vaccines are not effective at preventing the disease. \n","111":"\u00e2\u20ac\u0153For over 100 years, there has been a strong association with vitamin A deficiency and adverse measles outcomes, especially in young children.

[1] But wait\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 despite a measles vaccine being around for half a century, measles is still considered a major threat by health authorities.\nAt its fifty year anniversary there were universal positive accolades in the media. Anyone who questions the value of measles vaccines or any vaccine is quickly pilloried because the science of the measles vaccine is supposedly beyond reproach. Proponents say that only conspiratorialists and lunatics would question it. \nBut, there are facts regarding the history of measles that almost never reach the light of day. Here are 14 things you may not have been told by public health officials, your doctor, or the media.\n1. Measles death rate had declined by almost 100% before the use of a measles vaccine\nDuring the 1800s, measles was a notable cause of death. Epidemics occurred every few years causing a large influx of children into local hospital wards. In Glasgow, England From 1807-1812 measles accounted for 11% of all deaths. In the years from 1867-1872, 49% of children in a Paris orphanage who developed measles died. [2]  Starting in the mid to late-1800s deaths from all infectious diseases, including measles, began to decline. By the 1930s in England and the United States the chance of dying from measles had dropped to 1-2 percent.\nA killed measles virus (KMV) vaccine came into use in the United States in 1963. What you may not have heard, is that by 1963, the death rate from measles in the United States had already dropped by approximately 98%. [3]\nSome New England states had no deaths at all from measles. During this year, the whole of New England (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) had only 5 deaths attributed to measles. Deaths from asthma were 56 times greater, accidents 935 times greater, motor vehicle accidents 323 times greater, other accidents 612 times greater, and heart disease 9,560 times greater. [4]\nIn England the measles vaccine was introduced in 1968. By this point measles deaths were extremely rare. The actual death rate from measles in England had fallen by an almost full 100%. [5]\n2. The 1963 measles vaccine caused a severe disease called atypical measles\nHistorically, measles would produce a high fever, cough, and measles rash.\nThe early vaccine that was experimented with was a weakened, live measles vaccine. This vaccine resulted in a much higher fever in about half the children that received it. Meaning, they had a 106 degree fever as opposed to the 103 degree fever they might have had with natural measles.\nTo temper this problem, measles-specific antibody was given in the form of immune serum globulin alongside the live vaccines. This practice blunted the obvious reactions (fever and rash) to the live virus in the vaccine, but had serious potential consequences.\nThe data show a highly significant correlation between lack of measles exanthema [rash] and auto-immune diseases, seborrhoeic skin diseases, degenerative diseases of the bones and certain tumors . . . We think that the rash is caused by a cell mitigated immune reaction, which destroys the cells infected with the measles virus. If this is correct, the missing exanthema may indicate that intracellular virus components have escaped neutralization during the acute infection. This may later lead to the aforementioned diseases . . . The presence of specific antibodies at the time of infection interferes with the normal immune response against the measles virus, in particular with the development of the specific cell mitigated immunity (and\/or cytotoxic reactions). The intracellular measles virus can then survive the acute infection and cause diseases manifesting in the adult age. [8]\nIn other words, suppressing the measles rash and fever, which may have seemed like a good idea at the time, interfered with the normal immune response. Interfering with the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune response, in attempt to compensate for a worse vaccine reaction, may have resulted in future problems in the adults that received this treatment. The use of immune serum globulin was recommended to be discontinued in 1968, but continued long after that. [9]  This practice continues to this day.\nA study from 1967 revealed that this killed measles virus vaccine could cause pneumonia and abdominal pain as well as encephalopathy (inflammation of the brain). These severe effects were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unanticipated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAtypical measles was severe and occurred after encountering natural measles or being vaccinated with a live measles vaccine, because of being originally vaccinated with the KMV vaccine.\nNearly 2 million doses of KMV vaccine were distributed in 1963-1967. The killed vaccine was usually given in a series of 2 to 4 doses at monthly intervals. Atypical measles was reported even 16 years after receiving KMV vaccinations. Atypical measles due to use of the KMV vaccine could prove deadly.\nA 13-year-old girl died on February 18, 1978, after being hospitalized at University Hospital, Ann Arbor, Michigan, with a diagnosis of measles encephalitis and pneumonia. The patient had been vaccinated in 1966 or 1967 with 3 injections of killed measles vaccine. One week before admission, and 10 days after a known measles exposure, she developed fever, headache, chills, cough, rhinorrhea, and severe vomiting. A fine rash appeared on her arms and spread to her trunk and face. She was seen by her physician, who diagnosed atypical measles. A week later, on January 23, her fever increased, and she had her first seizure. . . Upon arrival, she was treated with intravenous penicillin and hydrocortisone. Despite anticonvulsant therapy, she continued to have focal and then generalized seizures . . . Over the next several days, the rash began to fade, but the patient remained comatose. She died on the 21st hospital day. [13]\n3. Measles was supposed to be eradicated in 1967\nWith the invention of the killed vaccine and then a live vaccine, a campaign was started in the autumn of 1966 to eliminate measles from the United States. With vaccination of all the susceptible 8 to 10 million children, measles was projected to be eliminated from the United States by 1967.\n15 years later measles rates had declined, but the expected quick eradication did not occur. The response at that point, was to vaccinate all children and not just the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153susceptible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd children. The new plan would be to eliminate measles from the United States by 1982.\nYet, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until 1980 that a stable live vaccine became available. Those vaccinated before 1980 might not be as immune as had originally been believed because it was later determined these older vaccines were not necessarily effective.\nDr. Ralph D. Feigin, physician in chief of Texas Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital in Houston and an expert in infectious diseases, said people born before 1956 are assumed to be immune to measles, because nearly every child was exposed to the disease. The vaccine was first developed in 1963, but it was made from a killed virus and was not widely effective. In 1967 a live vaccine was introduced, but it was an unstable solution and lost its effectiveness if it was not properly refrigerated. It was not until 1980 that a stable live vaccine became available. As a result, people vaccinated before 1980 may not be immune. That is one reason measles is breaking out on college campuses. [17]\nIn the year 2000, cases had declined, and measles was finally declared eliminated from the United States \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 33 years after the original elimination target date. However, in 2012 the CDC pulled back from that declaration, stating that measles reappeared and was spreading. Of the total number of cases, 200 were attributed to foreign travel, but the source for 22 cases was never determined. [18]\n4. A single shot was said to provide lifelong immunity\nEdward Jenner is generally recognized as the inventor of the first vaccine in 1798, although the practice of using diseased human and\/or human pus in an attempt to protect against diseases is known to have been used even in ancient times. Jenner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccine was supposed to guard against smallpox. He erroneously claimed that it would protect someone for life. This statement would later prove to be completely false and the claims for the vaccine were modified to state that the vaccine provided temporary protection that would make the disease \u00e2\u20ac\u0153milder.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nSimilar to this statement, the inventors of the early measles vaccines made claims that the vaccine would provide lifelong immunity to measles with a single shot.\nBefore the era of vaccination, natural measles would mostly occur in younger children. But with the advent of vaccination there was an upward shift in age of infection to adolescents.\nBecause of this shift, the vaccine needed to be administered to this older population that historically would have gotten measles much earlier and had lifelong immunity. A significant percentage of this group developed fevers just as high as or higher than if they had had natural measles.\nThe idea of a single shot has been replaced in the current schedule recommended by the CDC to vaccinate at 12-15 months and 4-6 years [23], and now even adults are often told to get another vaccine. This second shot recommendation was issued after the repeated failure to eliminate measles with the single shot.\nThe idea of lifelong immunity came from the observation that those exposed to natural measles were immune for a very long period of time or for life.\nHowever, unlike natural measles infection, the measles vaccine does not appear to provide such long lasting protection. Protection afforded by vaccination appears to wane in number of years. Length of protection is estimated in this study to be approximately 25 years.\nLike the smallpox vaccine and the measles vaccine, most vaccines were originally claimed to provide lifelong protection. However, actual experience showed that this was never the case as it often is with natural infection.\n5. Large epidemics still occur in highly vaccinated populations\nIn the pre-vaccine era, measles freely circulated providing for natural boosting in the population. After natural measles infection during childhood, reoccurrence of measles was rare. The solid, lifelong protection afforded by natural infection has been replaced with a vaccine-induced immunity that wanes with time. Waning immunity among the vaccinated, combined with lower natural disease boosting will create substantial numbers of measles-susceptible people in highly vaccinated populations\nThis combination of effects can result in large-scale measles epidemics, despite high vaccination rates.\nDr. James Cherry, commented that, in the post-vaccine era, measles had become a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153time bomb.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [29]  Is this why the CDC and health officials go into a state of panic when measles cases erupt in well vaccinated populations? Do officials know that at some point waning immunity will start an epidemic even in a very highly vaccinated population? Think of the impact of this dynamic as the truly immune seniors die out of the population, and are replaced by vaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immune\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd people. \n6. Babies have become more susceptible to measles\nMothers transmit all sorts of protective immune globulins to their babies naturally via the placenta and these last for several months.  She also passes general and specific immunity through her milk.  A mother who has had natural measles yields protection to the baby against measles for about 12 to 15 months while breastfeeding. Mothers who were vaccinated transmit a shorter duration of protection to their babies. In the era of vaccination, babies are now susceptible to measles at a much earlier age.\nBecause of this decrease in maternal antibodies there are calls to vaccinate infants at younger ages. \nThis is already a well-established practice in very young infants in overcrowded, poor countries.\n7. Immunity is not always immunity: Shifting sands.\nBecause of the KMV vaccine, lack of understanding of maternal antibodies, and use of serum globulin, a large number of people were told that they needed to be revaccinated in 1977.\nBy 1989, because of numerous issues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the determination that the older vaccines were not widely effective \u00e2\u20ac\u201c everyone under the age of 32 (anyone born after 1957) was urged to be revaccinated.\n8. Immunity without antibodies\nScientists were surprised when they learned that individuals with a deficit in antibody production, called agammaglobulinemia, recovered from measles just as well as normal antibody producers.  This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disconcerting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd discovery was made in the 1960s when measles vaccinations were just getting under way.\nTherefore the antibody part of immunity is not at all necessary for the natural recovery from measles, nor the immunity upon re-exposure.\nNonetheless, vaccine scientists and public health officials have measured \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd solely focusing on antibodies. Antibody production does occur in natural infection but it is the last thing that happens and not a necessary part of recovery or long-term immunity. It is known that the immune system responds with more than just antibodies, yet because markers of cell-mediated immunity are elusive, antibodies have become the measure of whether or not a person is immune.\nWhen a person gets an infectious disease for the first time, the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system uses its innate powers, which mostly involve cellular immunity. In the process, it prepares for the future. The next time that same infectious agent comes around; the body will use its memory of the first experience so that it can react faster. This is done with or without antibodies.\n9. Vitamins A and C are key to normal measles recovery.\nWith a singular focus on vaccination and antibody response all other approaches dealing with measles were for the most part ignored. However, since the early 1900s it was known that certain vitamins had a significant impact on measles outcomes.\nVitamin A stops the measles virus from rapidly multiplying inside cells by up-regulating the innate immune system in uninfected cells which helps to prevent the virus from infecting new cells. It is well known today that a low vitamin A level correlates with increased morbidity and mortality. Vitamin A is a well-proven intervention for reduction of mortality, concomitant infections, and hospital stay.\nWhen the body fights any infection, but especially measles, vitamin A stores become depleted by various mechanisms. Measles infections and high-titer measles vaccines both impair cell-mediated immunity, in part because of vitamin A depletion.\nDr. Ellison reported in 1932 that well-nourished children rarely died or had serious infectious complications from measles, even without sulfonamides and other primitive antibiotics. As early as 1932, scientists found that mortality dropped by 58 percent when children hospitalized with measles were given cod liver oil, which contains vitamins A and D and omega-3 fatty acids. Later studies in the 1990s showed amazing results of vitamin A reducing deaths by 60 to 90 percent.  \nBy 2010 it was well accepted that supplementing with vitamin A during acute measles illness led to significant drops in both adverse outcomes and death.\nWhat happened to this wisdom in the era of vaccine development? How much faster would the decline in death curve have dropped if this basic fact had been widely accepted when it was first noted in the early 1900s?\nAvailability of vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables was another factor in disease morbidity and mortality reduction. There were improving trends in overall nutrition as seen by a parallel in the decline in deaths from measles and the vitamin C deficiency diseases.\nExperiments done in the 1940s showed that vitamin C was effective against measles, especially when used in higher doses.\nIn 1917 Dr. Drummond used cinnamon in the treatment of head colds and recommended its use for measles. At that time, measles was still considered a serious condition, with approximately 10,000 people, mainly children under five, dying each year in England and Wales.\nIn 1919 Dr. Drummond commented that cinnamon oil was an effective prophylactic against measles or that it made measles milder.\nIt is difficult to know exactly why cinnamon was so helpful, but today we do know that it possesses many beneficial properties; it is an antioxidant, and contains vitamins A and C and minerals like zinc, potassium, magnesium, and manganese.\n10. High titer measles vaccines increased death rates in poor countries\nDue to the lack of understanding that the measles vaccine uses up vitamin A stores, and a complete focus on antibody response, vaccination sometimes resulted in a higher death rate.\nThe study authors concluded that instead of looking for antibody response they should have been looking for long term outcomes to measure real results of their experiments.\n11. You can get measles and shed measles virus from the MMR vaccine\nConventional thinking states that you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possibly get measles from the measles vaccine or transmit it to others.\nAlthough thought impossible, this case illustrates a threat of vaccine-associated measles spreading from a two-year-old patient in British Columbia, Canada, in October 2013. This case of vaccine-induced (PCR-proven) measles occurred 37 days after the MMR vaccine. \nHealth officials were so concerned about viral shedding from the vaccinated child that they gave either a vaccine or measles immune globulin to all susceptible contacts.  Unfortunately, this intervention precluded accurate tracking of vaccine shedding disease to contacts. \n12. Is it really \u00e2\u20ac\u0153measles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the first place?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Flu\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is basically defined as a 100\u00c2\u00b0F or higher fever or feeling feverish (not everyone with the flu has a fever), a cough and\/or sore throat, a runny or stuffy nose, headaches and\/or body aches, chills, and fatigue. So if you have that you think you have the flu. Right? Actually no. What is often poorly understood is that a person actually has a syndrome (influenza-like illness, or ILI) that can be caused by various agents. Only a proportion of this syndrome is caused by influenza A and B viruses, but differential diagnosis on clinical grounds alone is not possible. So in other words, just because you or your doctor think you have the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flu\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean you have the influenza virus.\nIn a 2009 editorial by Thomas Jefferson of the Cochrane Vaccines Field, explained just what the incidence of ILI is and what percentage are actually caused by the influenza virus. Using perspective studies the Cochrane group determined that during the winter season about 7% of people come down with ILI \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 93% don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Of that 7% only a small fraction are from influenza \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 11% influenza, 6% RSV [Respiratory syncytial virus], 3% Rhinovirus, 2% PIV [Parainfluenza virus], and a whopping 77% from unknown causes. Based on this the conclusion was:\nSo what about measles? A 2002 study examined 195 children with rash and high fever. Comprehensive laboratory investigation showed that none had measles or rubella. Children were determined to have parvovius B19, group A streptococcus (GAS), human herpes virus type 6, enterovirus, adenovirus, and group C streptococcus.\nThis study was similar to an earlier study that found a number of measles cases were not in fact measles.\nMeasles incidence always relied on a doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clinical diagnosis with no laboratory confirmation. Now that laboratory tests are available, most \u00e2\u20ac\u0153measles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cases are now found not to be measles.   When you think have the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flu\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd you really have ILI (influenza-like illness) and when you think you have measles you really have MLI (measles-like illness.)\nSo just how accurate were the statistics of measles incidence in the 1950s and after? As an editor questioned in 1997, how could the effectiveness of the measles vaccine be known if diagnosing measles is so difficult?\nOnce vaccination became widespread, were cases of presumptive measles now no longer being diagnosed as measles? Was this refinement of diagnose a large part of the large decline in measles incidence recorded with widely acknowledged earlier poor quality vaccines?\n13. Declining disease incidence?\nAfter the introduction of the 1963 measles vaccine there was an apparent decline in disease incidence. This can be seen in many CDC and other graphs. These graphs form the foundation for much of the praise that the measles vaccines have received.\nKeep in mind that once you had a vaccine, even if you had just as high or even higher fever than expected from natural measles, you were not counted as having \u00e2\u20ac\u0153measles.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Statistics were kept for measles incidence but not how many had adverse reactions. For the more severe disease \u00e2\u20ac\u201c atypical measles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c incidence was not tracked, so those were not part of the statistics. Even today, the MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) vaccine has an acknowledged list of reactions. [51] Yet, if you have any reaction it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t incorporated into the measles incidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even if the reaction was worse than natural measles. MMR vaccine reactions:\nMild Problems\nFever (up to 1 person out of 6)\n Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20)\n Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (about 1 person out of 75)\nModerate Problems\nSeizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses)\n Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4)\n Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 out of 30,000 doses)\nSevere Problems (Very Rare)\nSerious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses)\n Several other severe problems have been reported after a child gets MMR vaccine, including:\n Deafness\n Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness\n Permanent brain damage\nBefore the introduction of the 1963 vaccine, the incidence of measles was already on a slow decline.\nWas measles slowly becoming less prevalent anyway? We know that measles can be sub-clinical 30 percent of the time, [52] and the death rate had already plummeted. Like smallpox, was the disease slowly burning out? Was the rise in breastfeeding and improved nutrition contributing to fewer diagnosed cases? How many cases that were recorded as measles based on a clinical diagnosis really other viruses? Can we at all trust measles incidence statistics in the first place?\nIf the trend continued as seen in the measles incidence graph, then measles incidence would have hit zero in the year 2000 without any vaccine program. Coincidentally, the year 2000 is the same year the CDC declared measles eliminated from the United States.\n14. Measles is not serious in well-nourished people.\nJust how bad is measles? As we have seen, historically measles was a seriously problematic disease which was often deadly. Even today in poorly nourished children the mortality due to measles is 200-400 times greater than in the well-nourished in developed counties. [53]\nIt has been recognized for a long time in the medical and historic literature that in well-nourished children measles is not a major cause of concern and usually a mild disease. Before the advent of a measles vaccine the fact that measles was no longer a major threat was well recognized. From the British Medical Journal in 1959:\nIn the majority of children the whole episode has been well and truly over in a week, from the prodromal phase to the disappearance of the rash, and many mothers have remarked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153how much good the attack has done their children,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as they seem so much better after the measles. . . In this practice measles is considered as a relatively mild and inevitable childhood ailment that is best encountered any time from 3 to 7 years of age. Over the past 10 years there have been few serious complications at any age, and all children have made complete recoveries. As a result of this reasoning no special attempts have been made at prevention even in young infants in whom the disease has not been found to be especially serious. [56]\nWhile no infectious disease should be treated trivially, if managed properly with good nutrition, vitamin A in pharmacologic doses, and adequate rest, there should be little fear of a disease such as measles with the significant resultant advantage of acquiring lifelong immunity. Nutrition and sanitation have always taken a backseat to medical interventions such as vaccination despite the fact that these were the overwhelmingly reasons that the infectious diseases of the past were largely tamed. Yet, when there is a reported case of measles (which we have learned is really MLI) the health officials and media become apoplectic and fill the public with irrational fear instead of using any logical and reasonable attempts at education. For example, public health officials could recommend the use of vitamin A, vitamin C, fluids and bed rest to ameliorate any problems with measles.\nThe efficiency of the cellular immune system is tied to the intake of dietary nutrients, including vitamin A, vitamin C, zinc, selenium, and protein rich in vitamin B. Poor nutrition leads to impaired cellular immune responses, which results in worse outcomes after measles infection or exposure. [57]\nIn 1988 there was an outbreak of measles in an Amish population that had not seen measles in 18 years. The Amish general eschew vaccination based on religious grounds and during the outbreak vaccination clinics were held but only 14 chose to be vaccinated. Of the 130 reported measles cases most has no issues with only 5 patients contacting a physician and 2 who were hospitalized. No details were described for the hospitalized cases, including their overall health and nutritional status. Imagine if the community had been adequately advised on vitamin A and other positive strategies instead of relying singularly on vaccination?\nConclusion\nDigging beneath the thin fairytale of the measles vaccine, it is possible to unearth a large number of facts that question the entire premise of continuously vaccinating the entire human population from cradle to grave.\nWe were told that a vaccine was invented to tame measles and we all lived happily ever after. As we have seen, this is not the case. Unfortunately, the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has achieved a magical cult like status in our society. Simply attach the term vaccine to anything and it instantly becomes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safe and effective\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the vast majority. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter what the ingredients are, who manufactured it, how it was made, or any of its less than stellar history. Vaccines are always the magic wand for any disease. No questions asked.\nWe now know that by the time the measles vaccine was put into place, the death rate had fallen to virtually zero along with a declining incidence of the disease. We were promised that a single shot would provide lifelong protection and that if only the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd number of children were vaccinated the disease would have been eradicated by 1967. Instead, we now have to have all children subjected to at least 2 vaccines with less than lifelong protection. Now, whereas natural measles exposure generally left the person with reliable lifelong immunity, measles vaccines leave the individual with waning immunity. Because the truly immune seniors are dying off, the vaccine immune are now recommended to get adult vaccines. [59] This dynamic of waning immunity means we will probably see measles epidemics even in highly vaccinated populations.\nBecause of an early and simplistic understanding of the immune system there has always been a myopic obsession with a single aspect of the immune system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c antibodies. This obsession continued despite the early understanding that recovery from measles required only a well-nourished cellular immune system with absolutely no antibodies at all. Vital nutrients such as vitamin A and C and any other non-vaccine approach have been virtually ignored. It was these ingredients that were key to a healthy immune system and complete recovery from measles or even other infections. And importantly when someone thought they had the measles they really had MLI (measles-like illness) that might have been the result of a different cause and not the measles virus.\nSadly, the victims of medical experiments are never counted. Those that suffered worse than if they had natural measles, those that developed encephalitis, those that suffered and even died from atypical measles, those that were given high-titer measles that later died of other infections, never make it into pages of a hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairytale, lest it become a graphic novel.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the vaccine seemingly lowered the incidence; however, this was only coincidental with the natural dynamics of measles.\nAs one of many examples involving all infectious diseases of childhood against which vaccines have been developed, ever since any measles vaccines have been introduced and used in mass proportions, reports of outbreaks and epidemics of measles in even 100% vaccinated populations started filling pages in medical journals.\nReports of serious reactions including deaths also appeared with increasing frequency. They are the subject of a separate essay.\nAtypical measles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a new phenomenon only in the vaccinated\nIt is less well known to the general public that vaccinated children started developing an especially vicious form of measles, due to the altered host immune response caused by the deleterious effect of the measles vaccines. It resisted all orthodox treatment and carried a high mortality rate. \nIt has become known as atypical measles. (AMS) \nRauh and Schmidt (1965) described nine cases of AMS which occurred in 1963 during a measles epidemic in Cincinnati. The authors followed 386 children who had received three doses of killed measles virus vaccine in 1961. Of these 386 children, 125 had been exposed to measles and 54 developed it [i.e. measles].\nThe new, atypical measles, occurring in the vaccinated was characterised by high fever, unusual rash and pneumonia, often with history of vaccination with killed measles vaccine.\nRauh and Schmidt (1965) concluded that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is obvious that three injections of killed vaccine had not protected a large percentage of children against measles when exposed within a period of two-and-a-half years after immunization\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nFulginiti (1967) also described the occurrence of atypical measles in ten children who had received inactivated (killed) measles virus vaccine five to six years previously.\nNichols (1979) wrote that atypical measles is generally thought to be a hypersensitivity response to natural measles infection in individuals who have previously received killed measles vaccine, although several investigators have reported AMS-like illness in children who had been vaccinated only with live measles vaccine.\nHe wrote that during a measles epidemic in 1974-1975 in Northern California, a number of physicians reported laboratory-confirmed measles in patients who had signs and symptoms, compatible with AMS\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdWe developed case criteria on the basis of serology and rash distribution and morphology.  In typical measles a maculopapular rash occurs first at the hairline, progresses caudally, is concentrated on the face and trunk, and is often accompanied by Koplik\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spots. In AMS the rash Is morphologically a mixture of maculopapular, petechial, vesicular, and urticarial components.  It usually begins and is concentrated primarily on the extremities, progresses cephalad, and is not accompanied by Koplik\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spots.  Cases were classified as AMS if patients had 1) a rash with the distribution and morphology characteristic of AMS, and 2) a fourfold or greater rise in titer of complement-fixing measles antibody or a convalescent titer of 256\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nContinuing measles outbreaks signal increasing incidence comparable with the prevaccine era.  \nIn the meantime, outbreaks of measles in vaccinated children have continued and intensified to this day.  Contemporary observations of the ineffectiveness of vaccination indicate to me that the incidence of measles has increased and has not continued decreasing as it did for some 100 years before any type of measles vaccination was introduced.\nConrad et al. (1971) published about the dynamics of measles in the US in the last four years and conceded that measles was on the increase and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eradication, if possible, now seems far in the future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nBarratta et al. (1970) investigated an outbreak in Florida from December 1968 to February 1969 and found little difference in the incidence of measles in vaccinated and unvaccinated children.\nRight through the 1980s, measles outbreaks in fully vaccinated children have continued all over the US and all other countries with high vaccination rates all over the world.\nRobertson et al. (1992) wrote that in 1985 and 1986. 152 measles outbreaks in US school-age children occurred among persons who had previously received measles vaccine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every 2-3 years, there is an upsurge of measles irrespective of vaccination compliance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nTo cap it all: the largely unvaccinated Amish (they claim religious exemption) had not reported a single case of measles between 1970 and December 1987, for 18 years (Sutter et al. 1991).  It is quite likely that a similar situation would have applied to outside communities without any vaccination and that measles vaccination had actually kept measles alive and kicking.  According to Hedrich (1933), there is a variety of dynamics of measles occurrence, from 2-3 years to up to 18 years, as later also witnessed by the unvaccinated Amish.\nMMWR (2009) reported that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reminded physicians about the importance of immunization against measles in response to outbreaks of the disease in the US.  64 cases of measles were noted between January 1 and April 15 2008.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Measles outbreaks in Africa threatens gains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reported by Voice of America, July 9, 2010.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6nearly 90,000 cases of measles have occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa since June 2009, including about 1,400 deaths\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nShi et al. (2011) reported on measles incidence rate and a phylogenetic study of contemporary genotype H1 measles strains in China, calling for a new vaccine, since the incidence of measles in China has increased over the last decade.\nA widespread outbreak of measles was reported across Europe during European Immunization Week (April 25, 2011).  Some 6,500 cases of measles were reported in 30 countries according to WHO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press release.\nMMWR Wkly Rep 2012; 61: 253-257 reported a quadruple increase in the incidence of measles in 2011.  Even though the absolute numbers appear small, the actual numbers were no doubt in my mind much higher. The outbreaks were blamed on imported measles cases. [Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the vaccine supposed to protect the vaccinated when in contact with someone with measles?]\nInstead of discontinuing vaccination with obviously ineffective and dangerous vaccines, re-vaccination, meaning further doses of the ineffective measles vaccines and the development of new vaccines are being recommended.\nLinnemann et al. (1973) concluded that measles vaccines were not provoking a proper immunological response in vaccinated children. \nBlack et al. (1984) summarized data on the ineffectiveness of re-vaccination published by several authors, who demonstrated that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153antibody titer in re-immunised children may fall after several months to very low levels, and that children vaccinated twice may still experience clinically recognizable measles, although in a much milder form \u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They concluded that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this state in which a child is immunologically sensitized, but not immune to infection, we shall call inadequate immunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \nUnfounded optimism for measles eradication in the US by 1 October 1982\nDespite the obvious lack of success with measles vaccination, in October 1978, the Secretary of the Department of Health, Joseph A Califano Jr. announced, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are launching an effort that seeks to free the United States from measles by 1 October 1982\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3.\nPredictably, this unrealistic plan fell flatly on its face: after 1982 the US was hit repeatedly by major and even more sustained epidemics of measles, mostly in fully vaccinated populations. First, the blame was laid upon the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ineffective, formalin-inactivated (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dckilled\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) measles vaccine, administered to hundreds of thousands of children from 1963 to 1967\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3. However, outbreaks and epidemics of measles continued occurring even when this first vaccine was replaced with two doses of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 measles virus vaccines and the age of administration was changed.\nThese warnings have not been heeded.  As the Swiss doctors wrote (Albonico et al. 1990), \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we have lost the common sense and wisdom that used to prevail in the approach to childhood diseases. Too often, instead of reinforcing the organism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defences, fever and symptoms are relentlessly suppressed. This is not always without consequences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nDestruction of transplacentally-transmitted immunity by vaccination\nMany researchers warned straight after the introduction of measles vaccine in the US that the generations of children born to mothers who were vaccinated in childhood will be born with poor or no transplacentally-transmitted immunity and will contract measles and other diseases too early in life.\nLennon and Black (1986) demonstrated that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153haemaglutinin-inhibiting and neutralizing antibody titers are lower in women young enough to have been immunized by vaccination than older women\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.  The same applied to whooping cough.  It explains why so many babies before vaccination age develop these diseases, and most particularly the much publicised whooping cough.\nDeranged cholesterol due to measles vaccination\nSoon after measles mass vaccination started, concerns about increased cholesterol levels and deranged ratio of high-density to low-density lipids in young children started filling pages in the medical press. \nVikari et al. (1979.  Effect of measles and measles vaccine on serum cholesterol.  Lancet; February 10: 326) quoted Drs Matthews and Feery (1978) who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6reported that immunisation with influenza vaccine seemed to be followed by an increase in serum-total-cholesterol and by a decrease in HDL cholesterol.  They suggested that immunisation with viral antigens or natural virus infection might contribute to variation in lipid levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nAnd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have measured serum-total-cholesterol in 97 children (average age 2 years) before and 6 weeks after measles vaccination (Rimevax, R.I.T. Belgium) and in serial serum samples of 27 measles patients (average age 4 years).  Children were fed ad libitum.  Antibody titres were assayed by haemagglutination inhibition and serum-cholesterol was measured with the method of Leppilnen.  Samples from the same child were measured in the same series\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Five children showed exceptionally high relative increase (more than or equal to 40%) of serum-cholesterol after vaccination, although the absolute values remained within normal limits.  No correlations were observed between the initial cholesterol values or changes in cholesterol values and measles antibody responses.  After 8 and 10 months the relative increase of serum-cholesterol was still recorded in two children. After natural measles infection the mean serum-cholesterol was low in the specimens collected 1-7 days after the onset of symptoms\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nVikari et al. (1979) then concluded, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our data show that natural measles decreases serum-cholesterol values in the acute phase of the disease.  This accords with the observations of Lees et al., who showed that experimental infection with sandfly virus infection decreased serum-cholesterol values for at least 10 days. Whether the same kind of decrease of cholesterol level occurs also after measles vaccination and, possibly, after other virus vaccinations needs to be clarified.  Our observations support the view presented by Matthews and Feery (1978) that natural virus infection or immunisation with viral antigens induces changes in serum-lipid levels in man\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nBell et al. (2012) wrote, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a large population-based sample of Australian school children we found a higher frequency of abnormal lipid profiles when compared to American data.  In addition, many children have levels outside reported healthy norms for Australian children.  Research tracking lipid profiles of Australian children to adulthood is needed to understand the association of these levels with future cardiovascular risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nIn her 72-page doctoral thesis, Louise Strandberg (2009) looked at length and exhaustively into interactions between nutrition, obesity, and the immune system.  \nImportantly, she writes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the 1950\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, it was first recognised that dietary fat could contribute to cardiovascular diseases in the Western World.  However, the Greenland Eskimos were known to eat large amounts of fat but still had a very low incidence of cardiovascular disease.  In the 1970ies, Bang and Dyerberg found that the Eskimos had low levels of cholesterol and lipoproteins, except for the high-density lipoproteins that is [sic] now known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the good cholesterol\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6quality of dietary fat rather than quantity is important for development of cardiovascular disease\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nThat would have represented the generation of non-vaccinated Eskimos.\nBased on medical research, a logical conclusion is that an important primary cause of the observed abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels in children may be an invasive medical intervention in the form of vaccination.\nContinue to part II HERE\nRelevant reading\nRauh LW, and Schmidt R. 1965.

After an eminent scientific career in micropalaeontology during which she published 3 books and some 90 scientific papers in refereed scientific journals in Australia and overseas, she studied babies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 breathing patterns with the Cotwatch breathing monitor developed by her late husband Leif Karlsson in the mid 1980s. Babies had alarms after vaccination, indicating stress. This introduced her to the subject of vaccination. She then started systematically studying orthodox medical papers dealing with vaccination issues. To this day she has collected and studied more than 100000 pages of medical papers.\nDespite such extensive research of orthodox medical papers published on vaccines over the past 100 years, she established that there is no scientific evidence that these injections of highly noxious substances prevent diseases, quite to the contrary, that they increase susceptibility to the diseases which the vaccines are supposed to prevent and also to a host of related and unrelated viral and bacterial infections. Vaccines are involved in a great number of modern ills of childhood such as immunoreactive diseases (asthma, allergies), autoimmune diseases (diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosis), cancers, leukaemia, degenerative diseases of bone and cartilage, behavioural and learning problems, to mention just the most important conditions.\nHer research into vaccination has culminated so far in two books and a number of shorter and longer individual papers published in a variety of scientific and medical publications. She has also conducted frequent international lecture tours to present the results of her research to parents, health and medical professionals and anyone else who is interested. She has also provided a great number of expert witness reports for court cases relating to deaths and injuries caused by vaccines, such as so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shaken baby\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd syndrome.\n","113":"Resources\nSingle Vaccines\nJABS is not primarily a provider of vaccine information but a support group of parents who feel their children have suffered a severe reaction to vaccines and been left with severe disabilities or have died. However, as we are asked on a regular basis for information on clinics and doctors who offer a choice on vaccines we are pleased to provide the following information which you may find helpful in making an informed decision.\u00c2\u00a0\nSingle Vaccine Petition\nhttps:\/\/submissions.epetitions.direct.gov.uk\/petitions\/46642\nJabs comment: The UK Department of Health appears to be enforcing an MMR or nothing policy. Please help parents to have a choice by signing the e-petition. We would be very grateful if you could also forward the e-petition link to anyone you feel might support this issue via email or any social networks you may be active on (Facebook, Twitter, Mumsnet etc.) Let us send a strong message to the Government that choice is the way to go not compulsion. Thank you to the creator of this petition Rachael Jenkins.\nIn the UK no childhood vaccine is compulsory so you have control over if, when and how you proceed with vaccinations for your child.\u00c2\u00a0\nJABS believes that the MMR vaccine should be suspended and parents should have a right under the NHS system to request the single component vaccines. Parents need to be aware when considering single dose vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella that Merck and Co USA, the manufacturers of Mumpsvax (Jeryl Lynn strain) announced in January 2010 that it would no longer provide mumps vaccines as single doses.\u00c2\u00a0\nParents need to be aware that single dose vaccines also carry a risk of side effects so please ensure you have accurate information on the potential side effects and also accurate information about the diseases when making your decision.\u00c2\u00a0\nOne way to access this type of detailed information is to ask your chemist or your doctor to provide a copy of the manufacturer's information leaflet on any vaccine that you are interested in.\u00c2\u00a0This is the patient information leaflet from within the vaccine boxes.\nThis leaflet details the contents of the vaccine, the contraindications and the adverse reactions known to be associated with the vaccine.\nThe MMR vaccine manufacturers' information sheets specify that the live vaccines should not be given\u00c2\u00a0to anyone with a compromised immune system and gives a specific warning if there is a family or\u00c2\u00a0personal history of neurological problems or if the child has had a seizure of any kind. Some of the\u00c2\u00a0families registered with JABS\u00c2\u00a0who believe that their children were damaged from a single measles\u00c2\u00a0vaccine have learned with hindsight that there were contraindications to the vaccine that the vaccinating\u00c2\u00a0GP had not identified.\u00c2\u00a0\nYou could also ask at your library for copies of medical text books on childhood illnesses that were published in the early 1960s. The single dose vaccines were introduced into the UK programme from 1967 upwards so any text book printed before this date should give you an accurate description of the diseases.\nWe currently have 2,000 children registered with JABS believed to have been severely affected by childhood vaccines. About two-thirds of the families who have completed questionnaires report a family history of allergies e.g. asthma, hayfever, antibiotics etc, and\/or a family history of immune system problems like diabetes, arthritis, epilepsy, Crohn's disease etc. What we suspect, but the Department of Health senior advisers reject, is that if a child has inherited a sensitive immune system then he\/she may not cope as well with a vaccine virus.\u00c2\u00a0\nThousands of parents have contacted JABS asking how to obtain the single dose vaccines.\u00c2\u00a0\nParents should contact their GP who, if he\/she agrees, can issue a prescription on a named patient basis and provide medical advice relevant to each individual child. If the GP or other health professional has trouble in sourcing a single dose vaccine please ask them to contact JABS.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe term 'Medically indicated' or a similar phrase on the prescription allows access through the 'named patient' procedure. This CAN be done under the UK NHS system if your GP is willing to help. The chemist seeing this term on the prescription is allowed to order the single dose vaccine from the licensed importer. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has asked doctors to explain the medical reason by adding a note to the prescription but this could be seen as breaking patient confidentiality. The doctor may justify the term to him\/herself in that the child may be left unvaccinated without the choice of single doses and 'it is better to offer something rather than nothing'.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf your GP wishes to check this information ask him\/her to contact the practice suppliers.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe Health Care Commission commenced as a Government regulatory body on April 1st 2004. This body has now been replaced by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) . The main purpose of the\u00c2\u00a0Care Quality Commission\u00c2\u00a0is to ensure that all organisations that have to register have been through a robust set of checks to ensure they are safe and competent people to provide the service to the public and have in place appropriate safeguards and quality assurance arrangements for their patients, to ensure that patients are properly protected.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe CQC has asked us to include in our information the need for parents to ensure that the clinics, and exclusively private doctors, parents choose to attend are registered by the CQC. Although JABS does not recommend nor endorse any of the following establishments or individual doctors, we list them for information purposes only. Please ensure that you ask the doctor\/practitioner all relevant questions regarding the vaccines offered. (E.g. availability, time interval between vaccines, name of manufacturer, date of manufacture, safety, efficacy, contra-indications to use of vaccine etc.)\u00c2\u00a0\nPLEASE NOTE. JABS neither recommends nor advises against vaccination knowing that many children will continue to be damaged by combination and single dose vaccines. However, it is for the parent(s) to take full responsibility for vaccine decisions which involves some degree of research before making an informed consent or refusal. JABS is trying to support free choice and full information on the real risks of vaccination and childhood diseases.\u00c2\u00a0\nParents should appraise themselves of the registration status of the following doctors and clinics with the Care Quality Commission. www.cqc.org.uk\u00c2\u00a0 Tel: 03000 616161\u00c2\u00a0\n1)\u00c2\u00a0Independent Family Healthcare\u00c2\u00a0\nLeeds clinic: The Orchard, Town Street, Horsforth, North Leeds LS18\u00c2\u00a0 5BL\nManchester clinic: Calderbank Medical Chambers, 87 Palatine Road, West Didsbury, Manchester M20 3JQ\nSouth Yorkshire and Lancashire ring 01625 441630 for your closest clinic\nHealth professionals in the private sector have set up Independent Family Healthcare\u00c2\u00a0to offer\u00c2\u00a0immunisation choices, e.g single MMR vaccination,\u00c2\u00a0chickenpox, tetanus,\u00c2\u00a0BCG, polio,\u00c2\u00a0rotavirus etc\u00c2\u00a0that are\u00c2\u00a0not available through the NHS, or only available to restricted vulnerable groups.\nIn addition, we also offer\u00c2\u00a0Private General Medical\u00c2\u00a0and Paediatric Specialist Consultations with complete confidentiality and run\u00c2\u00a0Company Health Scheme\u00c2\u00a0(to include routine health screening, medicals, business travel clinic, occupational health services, flu jabs) Allergy Testing,\u00c2\u00a0Childrens Health Checks\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Nutrition for Children.\nThe Clinic is based in Horsforth, North Leeds on every other Saturday of the month.\u00c2\u00a0 For more information or to book an appointment please call 01625 441630 or visit our website\u00c2\u00a0 www.familyhealthcare.org.uk\u00c2\u00a0 .\u00c2\u00a0\nA second clinic is based in West Didsbury, Manchester.

My degree should speak and people should listen, that was my attitude as seems is yours. But the more I worked and learned about the system (from being in the system), I was humbled in ways that made me realize that things ain't as good as we were lead to believe. There is still a lot of \"mad\" in our science. I slowly  realized that often the underlying science is good, but the delivery or application is often flawed or corners are cut, sometimes even knowingly. I have also seen cases where the science was just bad, we all have seen new evidence bring about a new era of understanding.  My point of caution to you is that this community as a whole is not nearly as pristine and as efficient (i.e. safe) in its practices as you seem to believe, otherwise you would not be so vocal in your efforts.  Believe me, you just wouldn't.\nI have seen cases where vaccines have maimed and hospitalized grown strong men and where specific lots and\/or brands have been quietly pulled from the shelves after causing infections at an alarming rate.\nThat blog on package inserts is B.S. There are obviously individuals that are much more susceptible to problems when vaccines are administered than are others, just as  certain foods or natural particles can maim some and not affect others. These are real and possible outcomes that are rare for most, but more dangerous for a small percentage of folks that have autoimmune issues, allergies etc. (probably a larger group than we want to admit).  I am here to speak for these people who want a choice to not be forced by some authority that knows better than a a patient and their doctors. You can't make a blanket statement or rule that applies to the safety of all when it comes to vaccines. All I ask is that we keep this in mind and stop the over-posturing and overly generalized authoritative advice. Both sides of this argument have blind spots and I am here to point out yours. You argue from an academic stance, and I can appreciate the science behind vaccines as well. However, I spread caution from experience and the understanding that the world is not as wholesome and our science is not as pretty as many have led you to believe. \n","115":"The day has come and your little bundle is here. The wonder of it is overwhelming: this human grew out of two cells, inside you, and despite those last couple of days feeling like a year each, all of this happened in 9 months, without your doing much but standing by. If you are in a hospital, your baby is likely to be snatched away from you upon entry into the world, and subjected to all manner of empirical interventions aimed at damage control for all of his weaknesses and lurking dysfunctions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c antibiotics in his eyes, vitamin K in his blood, a good scrubbing with some 1, 4-dioxane and formaldehyde-containing baby wash, and, since 1991, the Hepatitis B vaccine.\nWhat is That? Why Does my Baby Need it?\nAccording to the\u00c2\u00a0CDC, everyone needs it. As far as we understand it, this is a communicable infection that can, in debated percentages, progress to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. Populations at risk are those having unprotected sex, using IV drugs (not most babies!), those transfused, or in blood contact with an infected party. Of adults infected, 90-95% clear the virus on their own, without intervention, according to my medical school textbook,\u00c2\u00a0Harrisons Principals of Internal Medicine. The concern for infant contraction of the virus is that the immature neonatal immune system \u00e2\u20ac\u0153allows\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the virus to hang out chronically in up to\u00c2\u00a090% of cases. Then, in the second or third decade of life, most of these infected infants enter the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HBeAg+ phase,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where they may be at escalating risk for cirrhosis, progressive liver damage, and cancer. Viral replication, the genotype of the virus (8 are known), liver cell damage as measured by enzymes, and characteristics of the host immune response render the movement through different phases of chronic infection quite variable. So, in those mothers with active infection as determined by testing for viral DNA and antigen\/antibody, managing the transmission to the baby is a compelling concern. I will address how we may be failing to address this compelling concern in an effective way.\nBut what about the rest of the babies born to non-infected mothers?\u00c2\u00a0Your\u00c2\u00a0newborn, fresh-out-of-the womb, baby needs this injection of genetically engineered recombinant viral DNA inserted into a yeast cell because they are reportedly easy to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153capture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at that point, and to assure compliance (unlike higher risk adults); however, prevention of vertical transmission from mother to child is thought of as the primary indication (despite ease of assessing whether or not the mother is actually infected) as this is a primary source of disease burden.\nMuch is unknown and difficult to quantify about the effects of the vaccine including that antibody production, if it occurs, may be very short-lived and certainly may not be carrying children into their teen years when they may be at higher behavioral risk for contraction. Assessments of prevalence pre and post vaccine introduction seem to have suggested that vaccination was responsible for a decrease in chronic hepatitis B infection in children\u00c2\u00a0age 6-19, but these papers use blood levels of HBcore antigen and surface antigen rather than\u00c2\u00a0polymerase chain reaction testing for\u00c2\u00a0viral DNA. What if all of this data were invalidated by outdated testing that fails to truly identify chronic infection?\nAn\u00c2\u00a0illuminating paper, just published in the\u00c2\u00a0Journal of Viral Hepatitis, may shed light on the true outcomes of this approach and its basis in a flawed conceptualization of the virus and its interaction with our immune system. This trial assessed for the infectious status of 259 pregnant women with Hepatitis B by looking at the presence of viral DNA, viral antigens called HBeAg and HBsAg which indicate that the body is actively infected, and antibodies to both antigens.\nAll of the babies in the study were vaccinated at 0,6,10, and 14 weeks, so as has been the case in every study of vaccine efficacy and safety, there was no naturalistic placebo group. One group of these babies received Hepatitis Immunoglobulin (HBIG) which is derived from actively infected adults, and the other group did not, and they assessed their levels of infection over a two year period. They looked deeper than in previous studies because they looked at the presence of the viral DNA in these babies over time, not just the antibody production or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immune response.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what they found:\nThe implication of this is that immune response to the vaccine, which is heralded as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of efficacy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in fact had no statistical bearing on infectious outcomes.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Only exposure\u00c2\u00a0to active maternal infection at birth correlated with future outcomes. Giving the babies HBIG (not the vaccine) may have suppressed overt infection in some cases, but it just sent it underground, to something called covert infection, so that fully 49% of babies remained infected after these interventions.\nContrary to claims (often industry-funded:\u00c2\u00a0refs 5 and 9;\u00c2\u00a0ref 11) of cited studies which assert 85-95% efficacy of the vaccine alone and in combination with HBIG in preventing acute and chronic infection in babies born to infected mothers,\u00c2\u00a0this\u00c2\u00a0study found that, not only were babies going on to develop chronic infection, but the type of infection they developed did not prompt the expected antibody response and would likely smolder there chronically without routine detection including when these individuals may go on to donate blood, donate organs, and have sex.\nNo historical studies claiming vaccine efficacy have ever actually tested for the persistent presence of viral DNA. In fact, most have assessed only for the presence of antibodies.\nThis covert infection is theorized to develop as a result of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immune pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from these treatments, which result in viral mutations eluding the host, and result in failure to produce detectable antibodies. These mutations\u00c2\u00a0accumulate in vaccinated children\u00c2\u00a0and can be transmitted from mother to child.\nWhat this means is that, current practice, as applied to the group of people most appropriate for the intervention (those infants of infected mothers we were hoping to protect), is not effective at preventing infection and may contribute to mutations in the virus that allow for covert infection.\nSo, if it works even 1% more than a coin toss in preventing infection, than why not just do it?\nBecause it is a toxic exposure that has unknown and unpredictable effects. It has never been appropriately studied in humans (true placebo control), and what we are observing from population-based reports is that 443,093 adverse events (headache, irritability, extreme fatigue, brain inflammation, convulsions, rheumatoid arthritis, optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and neuropathy ) have been registered including >1500 deaths, often labeled as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. NVIC discusses:\nAn historic report in 1994 published by the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, reviewed the medical literature for evidence that vaccines, including hepatitis B vaccine, can cause a variety of immune and neurological health problems. An independent committee of physician experts concluded that\u00c2\u00a0there were no case controlled observational studies or controlled clinical trials conducted on hepatitis B vaccine either before or after licensure to scientifically evaluate persistent reports that hepatitis B vaccine can cause sudden infant death syndrome; Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and other central demyelinating diseases including transverse myelitis, optic neuritis, and multiple sclerosis; and immune system dysfunction including chronic arthritis.\nThe Institute of Medicine feels that causal relationships cannot be established between vaccination and adverse events because of inadequate data. This data seems imperative to begin formally accumulating.\nWhy is it so Toxic?\nHow it is prepared:\nAnd\u00c2\u00a0causes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nAs someone interested in the role of inflammation in chronic diseases including mental illness, cardiac disease, cancer, and autoimmunity, this quoted mouse study concerned me in that it demonstrated cumulative inflammatory stimulation and damage with vaccine exposure lasting after the first day of injection.\nAluminum activates microglia in the brain and is strongly linked to\u00c2\u00a0Alzheimers, Parkinson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease and autoimmune disorders. This is a known neurotoxin and potent immune stimulant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c added because the newborn immune system is actually built not to respond. This has been referred to as the\u00c2\u00a0anti-inflammatory phenotype\u00c2\u00a0and speaks to the powerful interplay between an infant, their mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s milk, and the priming of their immune system in the first 2 years of life. Several exploratory analysis have argued for a causative role for aluminum in autism incidence including\u00c2\u00a0one by Lucija Tomeljenovic and Shaw\u00c2\u00a0and by MIT researcher,\u00c2\u00a0Stephanie Seneff who states:\nAnother\u00c2\u00a0study\u00c2\u00a0found that children who received the Engerix B Hepatitis B vaccine were\u00c2\u00a074% more likely to develop \u00e2\u20ac\u0153central nervous system inflammatory demyelination\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than children who did not receive the vaccine, and 177% more likely to develop multiple sclerosis.\nStimulating immune response in the presence of a toxic additive or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adjuvant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like a metal, likely also contributes to autoimmune phenomenon according to current immune theories and is corroborated conceptually by the similarity between the HBV amino acid structure and human proteins.\nThe only\u00c2\u00a0primate study\u00c2\u00a0done with an\u00c2\u00a0unvaccinated\u00c2\u00a0control group, concerningly demonstrated delayed acquisition of neurodevelopmental reflexes in the thimerosol (ethylmercury-forming preservative) Hep B vaccinated group (particularly in those with low birth weight and gestational age) relative to the unexposed group. Studies such as this, along with other such as the one that discovered a 9x greater risk for receipt of special educational services in boys receiving the pre-2001 Hep B vaccine series, and one that suggested a\u00c2\u00a03-fold greater risk of autism\u00c2\u00a0diagnosis likely led to the removal of thimerosol from the product in 2001. The thimerosol-containing vaccine was on the market for 19 years before this change (and it is still an ingredient of the flu vaccine and tetanus), which may raise concerns for some about the delay in remediating dangers associated with these products. These dangers are learned of post-hoc, in the field, after many children have paid the price of inadequate placebo-controlled, long-term studies.\nAs a clinician, I go to great lengths to support healthy immunity in my pregnant patients. I do this through diet, minimization of environmental exposures, promoting exercise and mitigation of stress response through meditation. There is much to be learned about our immune system and particularly about its interaction with environmental factors, and other systems in the body, including neuroendocrine. Until we know more, we must tread lightly, lest we \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first do harm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something we doctors promised not to do.\nThank you for talking about this subject. I regret that I did no vaccine research prior to having my son. I relied on my doctors opinion. In 2012 they gave my newborn the hepatitis b vaccine when he was 2 days old directly before we where released from the hospital to go home. By the time we made it home (about 30 minutes) he was screaming intermittently and began to turn red. After six hours he began to turn purple in his head and continued to scream off and on. We ended up in emergency (it took us a long time to decide to go because the misinformed nurse at the hospital told me there were no adverse reactions to hep b vaccine). They admitted us, but conducted no testing. By the next day he returned to normal color, the crying had ceased; he nursed for the first time in 20 hours. He never again slept peacefully. He never again nursed normally. At two years old he was diagnosed as autistic. I know the hepatitis b vaccine causes brain damage which is later diagnosed as autism. The CDC scientists need to be held accountable for destroying an entire generation of babies.\nThere appears to be sufficient research and evidence that this vaccine can cause harm.  A  newborn infant should not be given these potent and risky injections.  I would opt to NOT have them vaccinate my child.  I had my births at home with a qualified midwife,  so this is one more vote for the advantages of home birth.  \nI acquired Hepatitis B when I was 18, still in High School. I still have no idea how I got it, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know anyone that had it that I had been exposed to, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a mystery to me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I recovered by taking high potency vitamins and a healthy diet. As far as I knew I was fully recovered and there was no risk of anyone getting the virus from me.  \nWell, in all the years I have gone to doctors for routine medical care, and filling out the paperwork for the initial visit,  I always indicated that I had had Hep B, but was never informed I could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccarrier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 until I met Dr. Mark Song at Harbor UCLA family clinic. He did several different blood tests to determine this, and ordered  an Ultra Sound of my liver\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6very thorough screening, and determined I am not a carrier.  Later I learned if I had been a carrier I could have passed it on to my husband and to my babies, but I had no idea and no one ever told me this. It seems someone should have told me I might be a carrier, but no one ever did, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense that I was never informed about this. \nWell 47 years since my illness, my kids are healthy, and I never passed it on to anyone.  When I went to work for a hospital they were requiring their staff to have the Hep B vaccine, so when I told them I had recovered from it many years ago, they were satisfied when they took a blood sample and identified the antibodies in my blood indicating my immunity, and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to take the vaccine.  \nThis article is the first I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard of this vaccine for newborns, and I really am glad i wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t faced with this decision, and if I were today I would decline for certain.\nMy biggest question I have about the Hep B Vaccine is my Chinese wife is currently pregnant with our first child. My wife has Hep B, but the tests always show that the virus count is so low in her body that each time they test to monitor it, its usually not even detected yet still comes up as positive. So would I still want to risk giving my child the Hep B vaccine when they are born or is the risk too high not to? I really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find any info out there on this very situation. If she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have Hep B I certainly wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be considering it in the first place.\nAs a specialized liver surgeon with years of experience, I applaud discussions such as these.  Though vaccinating your children against diseases such as Hepatitis B have been known to dramatically decrease infection rates, I feel that each person is free to decide for themselves when a safe time to vaccinate is.  Talking with your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pediatrician, as well as a liver specialist, may help to ease your fears of vaccinations.  However, as I take an individualized approach to all of my patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment options when they do contract a disease such as Hepatitis B, I feel physicians should listen to what their patients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fears are and ultimately what their decisions are regarding their own health.\nMy son was two days old when he recieved the HEPB vaccine. I had a bad feeling about him recieving it but my husband went ahead and allowed it. I believed my son is autistic. He is only two months but i saw strange behavior since he was one month. Im waiting now for tests to be ran although people im saying im overacting but my son is not as other two month olds. Its very scary and emotional but i will love him and make sure he recieves all the care in the world. Please do research before vaccines, i truly hate myself bc i watch my son everyday and i know he is not normal and its hard but i love him and thats all that matters.\nWhile I agree with you Dr. Brogan, just call a spade a spade. The CDC and big pharma, have teamed up in a greedy venture to line their own pockets. Newborns need a hep b shot like they  need a second ass. The people behind this despicable department and business, need to be taken out and replaced with HONEST, caring citizens and vaccines need to be given on a voluntary basis ONLY! To mandate them is a violation of our constitutional rights. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like saying to a parent, this might kill your child but you HAVE to give it to them. That is beyond WRONG! We need to join forces and fight this massive miscarriage of justice and the despicable people behind it.\n","116":"This is a guest post written by a fellow\u00c2\u00a0pediatric provider in our local healthcare community here in Arizona. I was extremely saddened to read of his children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent exposure to measles due the Disneyland outbreak. To read about my journey leaving the anti-vaccination movement, click here.\nTo the parent of the\u00c2\u00a0unvaccinated child who exposed my family to measles, \nI have a number of strong feelings surging through my body right now. \u00c2\u00a0Towards my family, I am feeling extra protective like\u00c2\u00a0a papa bear. \u00c2\u00a0Towards you, unvaccinating parent, I feel anger and\u00c2\u00a0frustration at your choices. \u00c2\u00a0\nBy now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all heard of the measles outbreak that originated in Disneyland. \u00c2\u00a0Or more accurately, originated from an unvaccinated person that infected other similarly minded\u00c2\u00a0vacationers. \u00c2\u00a0I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into a debate about the whole anti-vaccine movement, the thimerisol controversy (no longer even used in childhood vaccines), or the myth that MMR causes autism (there are changes in autistic\u00c2\u00a0brain chemistry prior to birth).\nLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk measles for just a minute. \u00c2\u00a0It once was widespread in the US. \u00c2\u00a0It is now considered \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceliminated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the US (not continually circulating in the population \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only contracted through travel out of country). \u00c2\u00a0Measles is highly contagious (>90% infectious)\u00c2\u00a0and can survive airborne in a room\u00c2\u00a0and infect someone\u00c2\u00a0 two hours later . \u00c2\u00a0Another fun fact is that measles is transmittable before it can be diagnosed\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c four days before the characteristic rash appears. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Measles itself is unpleasant, but the complications are dangerous. Six to 20 percent of the people who get the disease will get an ear infection, diarrhea, or even pneumonia. One out of 1000 people with measles will develop inflammation of the brain, and about one out of 1000 will die.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0That sounds fun! \nCalm down self. \nI assume you love your child just like I love mine. \u00c2\u00a0I assume that you are trying to\u00c2\u00a0make good choices regarding their care. \u00c2\u00a0Please realize that your child does not live in a bubble. \u00c2\u00a0When your child gets sick, other children are exposed. \u00c2\u00a0My children. \u00c2\u00a0 Why would you knowingly expose anyone to\u00c2\u00a0your sick unvaccinated child after recently visiting Disneyland?\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0That was a bone-headed move. \nWhy does this effect me and mine? \u00c2\u00a0Why is my family at risk if we are vaccinating? \u00c2\u00a0I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad you asked. \nRegarding measles, there are four groups of people. \u00c2\u00a0 \nFirst, the MMR vaccine results in\u00c2\u00a0immunity for most who receive it. \u00c2\u00a0Two doses provides protection that can be confirmed with blood titers. \u00c2\u00a0My wife is in this group.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \nSecond, about 3% of\u00c2\u00a0fully vaccinated children\u00c2\u00a0do not develop a lasting\u00c2\u00a0immune\u00c2\u00a0response. \u00c2\u00a0They\u00c2\u00a0have low blood titers and are not protected\u00c2\u00a0against measles. \u00c2\u00a0If exposed, this group will likely get the illness. \u00c2\u00a0I am in this group. \u00c2\u00a0I was thankfully not exposed. \nThird, we have the unvaccinated. \u00c2\u00a0My son,\u00c2\u00a0Eli, is ten months old. \u00c2\u00a0He is too young to received the MMR vaccine and thus has no protection. \u00c2\u00a0Whether by refusal or because they are too young, exposed unvaccinated\u00c2\u00a0children have a\u00c2\u00a0 90% chance \u00c2\u00a0of getting\u00c2\u00a0measles. \nFourth, there are children like my\u00c2\u00a0Maggie. \u00c2\u00a0These are child who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be vaccinated. \u00c2\u00a0Children who have cancer. \u00c2\u00a0Children who are immunocompromised. \u00c2\u00a0Children who are truly allergic to a vaccine or\u00c2\u00a0part of a vaccine (i.e anaphylaxis to egg). \u00c2\u00a0These children remain at risk. \u00c2\u00a0They cannot be protected \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 except by vaccinating people around them. In August of 2014, Maggie was diagnosed with\u00c2\u00a0pre-B acute lymphoblastic\u00c2\u00a0leukemia, a form of childhood leukemia. We have been fighting leukemia since then. \nUnvaccinating parent, thanks for screwing up our three week \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vacation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from chemotherapy. \u00c2\u00a0Instead of a break, we get to\u00c2\u00a0watch for measles symptoms and pray for no fevers (or back to the\u00c2\u00a0hospital we go).\u00c2\u00a0 Thanks for making us cancel our trip to the snow this year. \u00c2\u00a0Maggie really wanted to see snow, but we will not risk exposing anyone else. \u00c2\u00a0On that note, thanks for exposing 195 children to an\u00c2\u00a0illness considered \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceliminated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the U.S. \u00c2\u00a0Your poor choices don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just affect your child. \u00c2\u00a0They affect my family and many more like us. \nPlease forgive my sarcasm. \u00c2\u00a0I am upset and just a little bit scared. \nPhoenix Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital has been great though this whole ordeal. \u00c2\u00a0We have done what is\u00c2\u00a0physically possible to protect our children. \u00c2\u00a0Now we pray. \u00c2\u00a0Please pray alongside us. \u00c2\u00a0 \nWe are not currently contagious. \u00c2\u00a0Rest assured, if measles visits our house, it will not spread to anyone else. \u00c2\u00a0 \nThank you for your prayers and\u00c2\u00a0support.\nDr. Tim Jacks, DO, FAAP is board certified by the American Board of Pediatrics and a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\u00c2\u00a0Originally from Elmhurst,\u00c2\u00a0Illinois, Dr. Jacks has lived in the greater Phoenix area for the past 25 years.\u00c2\u00a0When not working as a pediatrician, Dr. Jacks enjoys spending time with his wife and two children, running, playing with computers, exploring the great outdoors, and being involved at his church.\nThis post was originally published on Maggie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CareBridge Journal.

But most people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know something very important about me. I have a history with vaccinations that I have kept quiet for a long time.\nI am the first born of four children to wonderful parents. My mom and dad would go to the moon and back for any of us kids, and many of their selfless actions still continue to amaze me today. My mom is an educator, and a very good one at that. She can make a research topic out of anything. I remember while planning my wedding, my mom researched for days the exact style and order of every single word on my wedding invitations, even finding historical invitations from different time periods to serve as guides. So, in 1992, when I was born, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising that she did her homework when it came to vaccinating me. After researching, she decided to vaccinate me based off of what she found and her pediatrician\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendations. Then she vaccinated my little sister. After all, my parents both still have a small scar on their arm from the smallpox vaccination they received as a children, serving as a reminder of the fight against the disease that ravaged mankind for a millennium. Even as recently as the decade they were born in the 1960\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, smallpox killed as many as 2 million a year. But as these life-threatening diseases began to slowly fade away, the accusations started flowing out of the media. Immunizations cause Autism. Immunizations aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t effective. They contain mercury that could ruin your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brain. Maybe children will be allergic to them. They will overload the immune system. Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t natural immunity better than vaccine immunity anyway? The vaccination schedule is a get-rich-fast scheme for physicians and pharmaceutical companies. I have heard them all.\nWith the growing voice of the anti-vaccination movement, my mom, with her master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degree in education, heard them too. The allegations against vaccinations could make any parent cautious. As a result, the third daughter in our family received very few vaccinations and by the time my brother was born, he received almost none at all. As likeminded people tend to congregate, we were surrounded by friends and family that chose not to vaccinate as well. These parents, like my own, would have died for their kids in a minute they loved them so much. With the rising vaccine accusations, they absolutely believed they were doing the safest thing for their children. Fast forward to my college days when I decided to become a nurse practitioner, and a pediatric nurse practitioner at that. I remember discussing with my mom that the only down-side to my specialty would be giving vaccinations to children. She told me that I would figure that out later though, and just to let parents pick out the vaccines that they wanted. Something like that. In coming up with topics for my thesis, I wanted to study the adverse effects of vaccinations and all the children suffering from them. I wanted to study the link between immunizations and Autism; look into all the shattered immune systems from combination vaccines. I wanted to learn about what I had heard from my community for so long, and represent their opinions in the scientific community.\nAnd that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when I started to change my mind.\nThere was nothing to finish a thesis on. The evidence just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there.\nMaybe vaccinations weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so bad after all.\nOver the course of my education, I went on to care for a 1 month old fighting for her life against pertussis who was too young to be vaccinated. Her horrific cough and her helpless parents will stay with me forever. I learned from a case study of a child born in my county who later died because her mom developed chickenpox a few days before delivery. I was alerted by the health department when measles was found in my area. My own great uncle is in a wheel chair to this day from a childhood case of polio. I studied a child whose legs and arms were amputated after meningitis nearly cost him his life.\u00c2\u00a0 I watched a toddler almost die from dehydration due to rotavirus. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cared for many children with cancer and immunodeficiencies who I worry about due to daily declining herd immunity.\nBut most of all, I learned that this suffering is preventable.\nSo I graduated, and now I give vaccines. I started with my siblings, my family, and my friends. Over time, I have given thousands and thousands of vaccines, and I think it is one of the best accomplishments of my career. I can scientifically rebut the arguments against vaccinations that I heard as a child, and I do so on a daily basis. In fact, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to provide and discuss the science behind vaccines in more depth here on my blog. But at the end of the day, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try to convince parents of the anti-vaccination movement to vaccinate because I am raking in money or because I am a public health nazi, as I have been accused of. Rather, I work to convince them because I truly care. I have walked in their shoes, read their articles, and even believed their philosophies for a portion of my life. I worry for the anti-vaccination community that I grew up in. With most of these highly contagious diseases infecting 80-90% of the unvaccinated children and adults who come in contact with them, epidemics are not far away. In fact, California declared a pertussis epidemic last month. These diseases are lurking in our neighborhoods, and I have to speak out. I love what Jeffrey Kluger wrote in TIME magazine, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccines save lives; fear endangers them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I want my friends in the anti-vaccination community to not be afraid, and as someone who knows them best, I want to continue sharing my story, my personal experiences, and the science to help eliminate vaccination fear and protect their children.\nWhat do you think about vaccinations? Leave me a comment!\nAny comments that are deemed\u00c2\u00a0inappropriate, vulgar, or attacking-in-nature will be taken down. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s keep the conversation positive for all!\n","118":"AUSTIN (KXAN) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Joann Saathoff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14-year-old Pomeranian, Lexy, died on Sept. 24, and she believes the round of vaccinations Lexy received 12 days earlier led to her death.\nNow Saatoff is trying to raise awareness about the options owners of senior pets have when it comes to getting shots for their furry friends.\nIt all started when Lexy went in for her annual check up. She was evaluated by the vet first, who said Lexy was in good health. Then Lexy received five shots, the same exact group of shots she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d received the year before. Within a few hours, Saathoff said her active dog had grown lethargic.\nShe took Lexy back to the vet the next day and they said her reaction was common, so they gave her an antibiotic and fluids. But Lexy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s condition continued to decline, the six pound dog threw up everything she ate. When she died, she weighed only three pounds. Saathoff said the cause of Lexy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death was starvation, but the veterinarian told her that it started with the vaccinations which were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too much for her system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nSaathooff began researching.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I found out there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of senior dogs out there that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handle the full regimen of vaccinations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.\nShe says she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame her vet, she just wishes she knew about other options. Now she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s urging other pet owners to ask about what is best for their pets.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153My message to the community is you have options with your senior level dogs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.\nThe rabies vaccine is required by law and others like DHLPP and Bordatella are recommended for dogs.\nJenna Mize,\u00c2\u00a0 associate veterinarian at the Firehouse Animal Center in Austin, explained that while many pets have mild symptoms after vaccinations, most of those disappear after a few days. It is rare to see pets die after vaccinations, though it is more common in smaller dogs, Mize said. In most cases, the potential benefits of vaccinations far outweigh the costs, she added.\nShe said the best bet for any pet owner is to have a conversation with their vet about how vaccinations may affect their animal.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In any animal old or young, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always consideration for their age, lifestyle and also geographic location,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she explained.\nMize recommends getting a vaccination plan that is individualized to your pet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs and the diseases that are common in your area.\nOne option for pet owners who are not comfortable with vaccinating their dogs, running a test called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153titer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mize said. The titer is a blood sample pet owners have to pay for which measures antibody levels, which could show the veterinarian whether a vet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous vaccinations are still protecting them.\nSome vaccinations can last five to seven years and others need to be updated annually, which is why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all the more important to work with your vet on a plan that is tailored to your animal, Mize said.\nMize hopes that in the future, the veterinary and academic worlds invest more in looking into the health issues older dogs may face with vaccines.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problem is there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t data on vaccines and older dogs, the science isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there, the research isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.\n","119":"The most recent outbreak of measles, set off by an unvaccinated visitor to Disneyland, may be contained before it spreads too far. With luck, there will be no deaths or serious, long-lasting complications. But it has already sickened more than 30 people in four states \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all traceable back to this single Patient Zero. That should worry and enrage the public because it is a reminder of the far worse scenario that could occur if the anti-vaccine movement doesn't get over its ignorant and self-absorbed rejection of science.\nThis is exactly what epidemiologists worry about: One unvaccinated person with a disease that is highly contagious traveling to a tourist destination that draws people from throughout the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even before she knows she's ill. In this case, the woman was packed in with others at the theme park, including babies too young to have been vaccinated. She traveled in the tight confines of two airliners, and she visited other attractions as well.\nWhat has kept this from becoming a nightmare scenario so far is the fact that most Americans still do the right thing; they continue to be vaccinated. That \"herd immunity\" of the vast majority protects the vulnerable \u00e2\u20ac\u201d those too young to have been inoculated, or people with medical conditions that make vaccination-risky, as well as the few who receive the vaccine but don't derive immunity from it.\nBut that protection is being eroded as the anti-vaccination movement grows, laying the groundwork for ongoing and bigger outbreaks \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even though the risks associated with the vaccine are rarer than the risks associated with the illness. Getting vaccinated is good for the health of the inoculated person and also part of one's public responsibility to help protect the health of others.\nThe prospect of a new measles epidemic is disturbing. So is the knowledge that many ill-informed people accept a thoroughly discredited and retracted study in the journal Lancet that purported to associate vaccination with autism, and that others mumble darkly about mercury in the inoculations. The kind of mercury that used to be in vaccines was ethylmercury, which is eliminated from the body quickly, not the truly dangerous methylmercury. In any case, the measles vaccine no longer contains it. \nIt's bad enough that a nasty strain of flu has now hit 46 states; our ability to fight that is limited because doctors must make an educated guess, many months in advance, about which flu strains will be dominant. This year, the guess didn't work out, and flu shots have been less effective.\nBut measles is a disease that has been beaten by modern medicine. That makes it all the more frustrating that anti-science stubbornness has proven, in the case of the Disneyland-related measles, that when it comes to contagious diseases, it's a small world after all.\n","120":"Heather Crist Paley loved the private Facebook page where she could seek out advice from other mothers on such topics as finding a good nanny and the safety of raw milk.\nThere was only one subject she knew was prohibited \u00e2\u20ac\u201d vaccines.\nBut when another member linked to an article on measles, the Los Feliz mother of two couldn't help but chime in.\nWithin minutes, Paley was banned.\nAs the national debate on childhood vaccines grows more intense, Internet forums such as Mommy2Mommy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d gathering places for parents to discuss child-raising \u00e2\u20ac\u201d are pushing back by restricting or banning the topic, sometimes banishing offenders.\n\"For the moment we ask you to refrain from posting about vaccines or measles,\" read an updated rule for the Moms of Inglewood and Surrounding Communities page. \"It's a very heated topic that rarely gets debated but instead gets personal and even hurtful.\"\nBut for Paley and other young mothers who said they enjoy the free-flowing conversation, turning off the microphone feels like censorship.\n\"Everyone's all adults,\" Paley said. \"They can handle themselves even if conversations do get heated.\"\nThe current measles outbreak has put vaccines back in the spotlight. Although the medical and public health communities are unified in their endorsement of vaccines, a minority continues to challenge that thinking.\nThe Internet is brimming with pro- and anti-vaccine sentiments.\nThere are \"Vaccine Zombie\" and \"Immunize (Vaccine Anthem)\" music videos. Articles are posted with headlines such as \"Benefits of Contracting Measles\" and \"Harm Measles Can Cause Even Worse Because Its Preventable.\" And there are online order forms for \"DNT VCN8\" and \"Fully Vaccinated\" T-shirts.\nFor Los Angeles mother Michelle Turner, the online forums were a \"lifesaver\" as she navigated the many questions of raising twin girls.\nSo when Turner saw warnings that vaccine-related posts would be prohibited on Mommy2Mommy and Moms of Inglewood and Neighboring Communities she was infuriated.\n\"I like to read the different opinions,\" said Turner, whose daughters are vaccinated but who follows forums on natural alternatives for a range of issues. \"I like to be educated and challenged in my thinking.\"\nAnother parent in the Inglewood Facebook group, who asked not to be identified because she risks being removed from the forum, said the restriction smacks of a misguided assumption that a group of \"grown women can't have an intellectual conversation about this without attacking one another.\"\nThe woman, who is having her 4-year-old son vaccinated on a delayed schedule, said she considers posts about measles to be important health alerts, especially for parents of unvaccinated children.\n\"It's about being informed,\" she said.\nStill, the conversations can grow caustic. As the number of confirmed measles cases ticked up in recent weeks, pro-vaccine parents increasingly vocalized concern \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or anger \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that choosing not to immunize harms the community overall.\nThe broad conversation has been \"very ugly and very unpleasant,\" said Santa Monica pediatrician Dr. Jay Gordon, who advocates for parents' right to choose whether to vaccinate.\nGordon said that even some politicians have begun demonizing parents who question immunization. He urged pro-vaccine parents to try to understand the other side.\n\"Coercion doesn't work, shaming doesn't work,\" he said, speaking at a Hollywood premiere Wednesday for a vaccine-related documentary.\nOrange County pediatrician Dr. Bob Sears, who recommends a delayed timetable for parents who choose to vaccinate their children, agreed.\n\"We do not need to hate them and ostracize them and, frankly, discriminate against them,\" Sears said of the sharp criticism of so-called anti-vaxers.\nSears posts a daily message on his Facebook account, which has more than 39,000 \"likes,\" and said he will \"ban the haters on both sides\" if users' comments include name-calling or hurtful language.\nStill, the tone of the language shows signs of degenerating.\n\"We can't get along because the anti vaxers are going to end up killing people! So if we put them all on one submarine and send them far away, that would be awesome!,\" one commenter wrote in response to Sears' post on why both sides need to \"figure out a way to get along and love each other.\"\nAnother commenter wrote: \"We don't take the claims from the flat earth society seriously because they are patently ridiculous, how are the claims from the anti-vaccine movement any less so?\"\nEven for Atlanta-based advocacy group Voices for Vaccines, conversations come close to \"going off the rails,\" said Karen Ernst, who leads the group and oversees its Facebook page.\n\"No human was ever born with a needle in them!\" wrote one Facebook user. \"This guinea pig practice is rooted in Nazi Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Our mad medical regime has successfully hijacked the collective mind of our nation.\"\nErnst, a former classroom teacher, said she attempts to keep the conversation civil and on course by filtering out profanity, forbidding people to post just links and steering commentators back on topic.\n\"I don't want to turn away dissenting viewpoints, even though my perspective is that those viewpoints are not based in science,\" she said.\nIn the Los Angeles-area family forum Peachhead.net, founder Linda Perry typically moves lengthy or ugly threads about vaccines off the main page.\nTo her surprise, the topic hasn't been a problem this year, but she said commenters usually like to have the last word \u00e2\u20ac\u201d an often futile desire in a group of more than 15,000.\n\"I feel like at this point you've heard everybody's opinion and it's never going to end,\" she said.\nAleigh Lewis, who said she was once \"vaccine-hesitant,\" said she found reassurance in her decision to vaccinate her daughter after reading the posts from others on a Yahoo forum for Los Angeles-area mothers.\nLewis said she has continued to post messages in the group, hoping to reach those as wary of vaccines as she was.\nemily.foxhall@latimes.com \n","121":"Alison M. Buttenheim, PhD, MBA\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153So how about that Disneyland measles outbreak?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0 As a researcher who studies vaccine refusal, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been asked this question a lot recently. More than 50 people have come down with measles after exposure at the iconic Southern California amusement park, and nationwide measles diagnoses exceeded 90 in the month of January alone. (For the record, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of measles cases to see in one month in the US in recent years, although 2014 was also banner year for the virus.)\nLast week a colleague posed a particularly compelling question: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDisneyland effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning, could this widespread outbreak produce a backlash against vaccine refusal and thereby reduce rates of vaccine exemptions, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alternative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vaccine schedules, or opting out completely of recommended childhood immunizations.\u00c2\u00a0\nParents less likely to refuse vaccines now?\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reasonable to expect a Disneyland effect. After all, there was strong evidence of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Katie Couric effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on colon cancer screening rates after Ms. Couric underwent an on-air colonoscopy in 2000. Similarly, an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Angelina Jolie effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on breast cancer screening rates for women with a family history followed Ms. Jolie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disclosure of her double mastectomy in 2013.\u00c2\u00a0\nSeveral features of the Disneyland measles outbreak are also conducive to moving the needle on parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 beliefs and decisions about childhood immunization: First,\u00c2\u00a0 the outbreak has high salience: news stories have run in major print and broadcast outlets almost daily, and the internet and blogosphere are packed with posts from all perspectives. If vaccine hesitancy and worries about the measles virus were just lurking in the back of your brain last month, they are top-of-mind now. The universality of Disneyland may make parents feel more vulnerable in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this could happen to us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd way\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no longer possible to imagine that measles outbreaks or high rates of vaccine refusal are happening in another state or another school community.\nSecond, the Disneyland outbreak could shift both the social norms around vaccine refusal and the framing of the importance of childhood immunization. \u00c2\u00a0In recent years, people arguing against the safety, efficacy, and necessity of vaccines have created a powerful social norm that validates vaccine refusal and privileges claims about vaccine-related harms. In the Disneyland outbreak coverage, we are seeing more stories framed from the perspective of the potential harms of measles: for example, the stress and financial burden associated with quarantining an exposed infant; or the request from a father of an immune-compromised child to keep unvaccinated children out of his son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s school. This could in theory produce more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153something must be done about this\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sentiment that could then lead, for example, to stricter state vaccine exemption laws.\nThird, this recent outbreak very simply plays on inherent present bias\u00e2\u20ac\u201dour tendency as humans to heavily discount future costs and benefits of a decision or behavior while overweighting current costs and benefits. For most parents, the benefits of vaccinating are intangible (we take an action so that something doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen), probabilistic (vaccines are not 100% effective, and the chances of being exposed to measles are small), and in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reasonable to imagine why parents with any level of concern about vaccines might opt out. The Disneyland outbreak shifts this calculus by making the cost of not vaccinating very immediate and tangible, and might therefore lead to decreased refusal.\nDespite these prior effects and reasonable assumptions, I hereby predict no such Disneyland effect this time. While I would be delighted to be proven wrong, I think there are at least three reasons why we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a lasting impact of the outbreak on exemption or refusal rates.\nFirst, our attention span is limited. While the Disneyland outbreak is getting a lot of coverage now, this will likely last for only a few more news cycles. (Caveat to this point: If someone were to die of measles from this outbreak \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which I decidedly hope does not happen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the salience and duration of the outbreak in the news cycle would both increase.)\nSecond, the parents whose vaccine beliefs and behaviors are most likely to be affected by this outbreak are the slightly hesitant and the undecided. We are not likely to see much shift in the more adamant, hard-core anti-vaccine folks.\u00c2\u00a0 In one anecdote from a news article on the outbreak, a non-vaccinating parent in Los Angeles reported that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153she hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even been aware of the Disneyland outbreak because she refused on principle to follow the mainstream news media. But she was in no doubt, even without reading the coverage, that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthey have skewed the facts in favor of trying to sell people more pharmaceuticals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\u00c2\u00a0 The same facts about the outbreak that might convince a moderately hesitant parent to vaccinate will only reinforce previously-held beliefs in a strongly anti-vaccine parent.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn a terrific recent paper, Brendan Nyhan and colleagues demonstrated this effect in a study in which parents were exposed to information about the dangers of vaccine-preventable diseases and the lack of evidence for an MMR-autism link. This information actually reduced intention to vaccinate among parents with previously unfavorable views of vaccines. Similarly, images of sick children with vaccine-preventable diseases increased beliefs in an MMR-autism link. So, the people whose beliefs we would most want to change in response to the Disneyland outbreak are the least likely to be persuaded. Unfortunately, these beliefs and the vaccine-refusing behaviors that accompany them tend to cluster socially and spatially\u00e2\u20ac\u201cand it is this very clustering that leads to outbreak \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot spots\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where herd immunity is most compromised.\nFinally, I am skeptical about a Disneyland effect because I have spent a lot of time looking for a similar effect in other recent, highly-publicized outbreaks (including a 2008 measles outbreak in San Diego, California) and have failed to find one. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen this time. I will continue to look for shifts in social norms, beliefs, and behaviors in response to vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, and work towards developing interventions that reduce vaccine hesitancy and boost herd immunity in the population.\u00c2\u00a0 Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not let any more trips to Disneyland be ruined by Mickey Mouse science.\n","122":"What vaccines does my pet need? \nAre vaccines and annual boosters really necessary?\nWhat does each vaccine prevent against?\nAre there adverse side effects to over-vaccination?\nThese are just a few of the questions we get on a regular basis regarding vaccines. Keeping track of the various pet vaccines and their associated inoculation schedules can be confusing and a bit overwhelming. Coupled with the often heated and sometimes emotional national discussions regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines, you may wonder if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth vaccinating your pet at all. Well, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here to tell you it is!\u00c2\u00a0 We want to cut out all of the confusion and give you the facts about vaccines and why they are an essential part of your pet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preventative wellness care, helping your furry companion lead a long and healthy life!\nWhat are vaccines? How do they work?\nVaccines offer the greatest protection against specific infectious diseases caused by a virus or bacteria. We offer vaccinations for common dog and cat diseases that attack the immune, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems.\nVaccines are made from chemically-altered forms of the virus or bacteria that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause a disease, but stimulate the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system to produce antibodies against the disease instead. Antibodies work by destroying the disease-causing virus or bacteria if it tries to infect the body, then \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remembers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it, to fight against the disease in the future. The protection provided by vaccines gradually decreases over time and is specific to each vaccine. This is why boosters are required. Many vaccines are on an annual booster schedule, however some require a booster every six months (like kennel cough) and others can be once every 2-3 years.\nOf course, not all pets need all vaccines. The vaccines your pet needs depends on their age, health status, lifestyle, and what diseases are present in our area. At Leesburg Veterinary Hospital, we tailor vaccine plans to each indivdiual pet, so we are not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153over-vaccinating,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but providing the best comprehensive protection for that pet based on their lifestyle and risk factors.\nWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll discuss LVH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommended vaccines and immunization schedules below.\nRabies is an extremely serious (most-times fatal) virus that infects the brain and spinal cord of all mammals (including humans!). Rabies is spread through the saliva of mammals, most commonly by wildlife such as foxes, bats, raccoons, skunks, cattle, wild dogs and feral cats. Your pets would most likely get rabies by getting bit by a wild animal infected with the virus.\nSeizures, aggression, depression, excess salivation, weakness, coma\nVaccination is the most effective way to prevent the transmission of the disease in animals.\u00c2\u00a0 Vaccinating animals is the best safeguard to prevent the spread of rabies to human as well.\nBecause of the serious health risks to both pets and humans, the rabies vaccine is required by law in most areas of the country, including Virginia. Virginia law states that all domesticated dogs and cats must be rabies vaccinated by four months of age by a licensed veterinarian (this is why rabies vaccines cannot be administered by our LVTs at technician appointments). All dogs living in Loudoun County must be licensed with the county. This license runs concurrently with each pet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rabies vaccination schedule, therefore if a dog does not receive their rabies booster, they will not be lawfully licensed in the county. While cats do not need a license, their rabies vaccine should always remain up-to-date. This includes indoor cats too! There have been cases where rabid bats have gotten into people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s homes or indoor cats have accidentally gotten outdoors, potentially exposing themselves to rabid animals.\nRelated to older pets, there are very few cases where we would not keep an older pet updated on their rabies vaccine. We still advise cats with kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, many cancers, diabetes, etc. to keep their rabies vaccination status current. Of course, every pet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s medical history and conditions are different. Our veterinarians will determine the best option for your pet.\nPuppies and Dogs:\nKittens and Cats:\nDHPP is a combination vaccine. When not named using the acronym above, it is commonly referred to as just canine distemper. The vaccine also protects against hepatitis, parvovirus, and parainfluenza. Along with rabies, DHPP is considered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153core\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vaccine by the American Animal Hospital Association. Core vaccines are recommended for all pets because they protect against serious, highly contagious, and oftentimes fatal diseases.\nA life-threatening virus that attacks the respiratory, digestive, and brain\/nervous system of dogs. Distemper is highly contagious, spread from one dog to another through respiratory secretions from coughs, sneezes, and eye discharge.\u00c2\u00a0 Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, pneumonia, and seizures.\nCaused by canine adenovirus-2 and adenovirus-1 and transmitted among dogs by contact with secretions such as saliva, urine, or feces.\u00c2\u00a0 Hepatitis causes liver failure, eye damage, and respiratory problems. Symptoms are similar to those in the early stages of distemper.\nP=Parvovirus\nA highly contagious and life-threatening virus that attacks the digestive and immune systems and is spread through infected feces. The disease is more commonly seen in puppies. Symptoms include severe vomiting and diarrhea and usually requires several days of hospitalization to treat.\nA highly contagious viral respiratory infection that is a contributor for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kennel cough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in dogs. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go into kennel cough in greater detail when we discuss its other contributing virus, bordetella.\nPuppies will receive a series of three DHPP vaccines by the time they are five months old. Healthy pups nursed from a healthy mother receive antibodies in their mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s milk that will protect the pup and help him\/her build immunity until the first round of vaccines at 8-10 weeks old:\nLeptospirosis is a contagious bacterial disease carried by wild animals such as deer, raccoons, mice, and cows. It is spread through an infected animal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bodily fluids (urine, specifically) or by drinking contaminated water from lakes, streams, etc., and is absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes. Leptospirosis can be passed from pets to humans.\nSevere diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, weakness, liver and kidney failure\nPets exposed to potentially contaminated water such as streams or ponds, go walking on hiking trails, or swim in our local rivers and lakes are at risk for leptospirosis. We recommend all of our canine patients who fit this criteria be vaccinated against leptospirosis.\u00c2\u00a0 \nLeptospirosis is available as part of the distemper combo vaccine (DHLPP). Puppies will receive the leptospirosis vaccine as a 2 series booster during the DHPP vaccination between 12- 16 weeks of age as discussed above, then once annually. Since the distemper vaccine is only given every 3 years after year 1, the leptospirosis vaccine is given individually on the years when distemper is not needed.\nLyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted through tick bites, most commonly by the deer tick.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Lyme disease can be transmitted to both dogs and humans from tick bites. It is not transmitted directly from animal to animal or from dogs to people.\nLyme disease is a debilitating disease causing joint pain and arthritis, decreased appetite, fever, lethargy, and in more rare cases, kidney or heart failure\nLyme Disease is extremely prevalent in Loudoun County. While we have one of the highest rates of Lyme infection in the country, it is preventable through a combination of regular tick checks by you, vaccination, annual blood testing, and a year-round preventative such as Frontline. We highly recommend all of our canine patients be vaccinated against Lyme Disease. Remember, deer commonly roam in residential neighborhoods and yards, so even dogs that are mainly indoors can contract Lyme Disease when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re out to go to the bathroom.\nThe initial Lyme vaccine can be given during the puppy exams with a booster 2-4 weeks after:\n*An update on our Lyme Vaccine:\nLeesburg Veterinary Hospital strives to practice the best medicine.\u00c2\u00a0 A more protective Lyme vacccine (Zoetis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 crLyme vaccine) is now available to the veterinary profession and we have chosen to offer this vaccine in our preventative medicine repertoire. To receive the full protective benefits of this annual vaccine, a first time inoculation is advised, followed by a booster in 3-4 weeks.\u00c2\u00a0 For pets who have already been vaccinated with our previous Lyme vaccine, an initial inoculation followed by the booster with the new vaccine is recommended by our doctors.\u00c2\u00a0\nAn infection of the trachea (windpipe) and the large air passages of the lungs. It is caused by the bacterium bordetella bronchiseptica, and the virus, parainfluenza.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Kennel cough is highly contagious and earns its name because it is easily transmitted through direct contact or through the air and rapidly spreads where dogs are confined together, such as kennels, dog parks, pet stores and grooming facilities.\nA harsh, dry cough, sneezing, retching, gagging, vomiting\nVaccination is the best preventative measure against kennel cough. We recommend the kennel cough vaccine for all dogs that have the potential to come into contact with infected dogs in public places.\nFor puppies: \nFor adult dogs:\nRecommended time to get vaccine before potential exposure: TWO WEEKS prior to boarding, visiting parks, puppy classes, etc.\nThe FVRCP is the core vaccine for cats. It is a combination vaccine, protecting against three serious airborne viruses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, and panleukopenia. It is commonly referred to as the feline distemper vaccine.\nAn upper respiratory infection caused by the common feline herpes virus. Symptoms include sneezing, drooling, runny nose and eyes, lethargy, and decreased appetite.\nAn upper respiratory infection with symptoms and clinical signs similar to rhinotracheitis. This virus prefers the oral cavity, so oral ulcers are also common; if left untreated, pneumonia can occur. Kittens and senior cats are most susceptible to the virus.\nCommonly referred to as feline distemper (but not related to canine distemper), this viral infection is extremely common and highly contagious among non-vaccinated cats. It is common in kittens who have not been vaccinated yet or strays that have exposed to feral cat colonies, other shelter cats, etc. The virus is especially harmful to young kittens as the virus attacks the new white blood cells in the bone marrow and intestinal tract, causing fever, respiratory illness, and severe vomiting and diarrhea.\nA virus that only affects cats, it is the most common cause of feline cancer (lymphoma), responsible for various blood disorders, and immune deficiency. Because it suppresses the immune system, it predisposes exposed cats to serious infections. FeLV is spread from one cat to another through bodily fluids \u00e2\u20ac\u201c saliva, blood, and to some extent, feces and urine. Transmission can also occur from an infected mother to her kittens, either before they are born or during nursing. Cats at greatest risk for infection are those allowed outdoors where an infected cat may bite them or those exposed to cats of unknown infection status.\nDecreased appetite, weight loss, poor coat condition, enlarged lymph nodes, inflammation of the mouth and gums.\nKeep indoor cats indoors! If you do allow cats to go outside, supervise them and provide an enclosed space to keep them from wandering or fighting with other cats. We strongly recommend the FeLV vaccine for all cats that spend any time outdoors. \nAre there risks associated with over-vaccination or adverse side effects to vaccines?\nVaccinations are one of the best tools we have in preventive veterinary medicine. Vaccines have protected millions of animals from illness and death caused by infectious diseases. The key to using vaccines appropriately is to determine which diseases your pet may be at risk for and then vaccinate for those diseases no more than necessary. As we mentioned above, the vaccines your pet needs depends on their age, health status, lifestyle, and what diseases are present in our area. \nVaccines work by mildly stimulating an animal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system in order to create protection from specific infectious diseases. Because of this, pets may experience mild side effects after receiving a vaccine, usually starting within hours of the vaccination. This includes:\nThese symptoms should last no longer than a day or two. Many pets experience no symptoms at all.\nFar less common, more serious allergic reactions may occur. These reactions usually occur more quickly, within minutes or hours of vaccination and require immediate veterinary care. These symptoms include persistent vomiting and diarrhea, itchy skin that looks bumpy (similar to hives), swelling of the muzzle, face, neck, or eyes, severe coughing, difficulty breathing,\nWith that in mind, we believe the benefits of vaccinations far outweigh the risks and are vital in keeping your pet healthy against infectious diseases. More importantly, we believe strong communication between you and your LVH veterinarian is the key to getting your pet on the appropriate vaccination schedule.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 With the facts in hand, you can now feel prepared to discuss the various vaccines or ask questions at your next appointment!\n","123":"UPDATE (Nov. 12): Kenya's government has launched an investigation into the Catholic Church's allegations. See follow up article here.\nKenya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Catholic bishops are charging two United Nations organizations with sterilizing millions of girls and women under cover of an anti-tetanus inoculation program sponsored by the Kenyan government.\nAccording to a statement released Tuesday by the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, the organization has found an antigen that causes miscarriages in a vaccine being administered to 2.3 million girls and women by the World Health Organization and UNICEF. Priests throughout Kenya reportedly are advising their congregations to refuse the vaccine.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We sent six samples from around Kenya to laboratories in South Africa. They tested positive for the HCG antigen,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dr. Muhame Ngare of the Mercy Medical Centre in Nairobi told LifeSiteNews. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were all laced with HCG.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nDr. Ngare, spokesman for the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, stated in a bulletin released November 4, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine. This evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization but was ignored.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nBut the government says the vaccine is safe. Health Minister James Macharia even told the BBC, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would recommend my own daughter and wife to take it because I entirely 100% agree with it and have confidence it has no adverse health effects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0\nAnd Dr. Collins Tabu, head of the Health Ministry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immunization branch, told the Kenyan Nation, that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is no other additive in the vaccine other than the tetanus antigen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nTabu said the same vaccine has been used for 30 years in Kenya. Moreover, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there are women who were vaccinated in October 2013 and March this year who are expectant. Therefore we deny that the vaccines are laced with contraceptives.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nNewspaper stories also report women getting pregnant after being vaccinated.\nResponds Dr. Ngare: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Either we are lying or the government is lying. But ask yourself, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat reason do the Catholic doctors have for lying?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dr. Ngare added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Catholic Church has been here in Kenya providing health care and vaccinating for 100 years for longer than Kenya has existed as a country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nDr. Ngare told LifeSiteNews that several things alerted doctors in the Church\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far-flung medical system of 54 hospitals, 83 health centres, and 17 medical and nursing schools to the possibility the anti-tetanus campaign was secretly an anti-fertility campaign.\nWhy, they ask does it involve an unprecedented five shots (or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jabs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as they are known, in Kenya) over more than two years and why is it applied only to women of child-bearing years, and why is it not being conducted without the usual fanfare of government publicity?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Usually we give a series three shots over two to three years, we give it anyone who comes into the clinic with an open wound, men, women or children.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Dr. Ngare. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this is intended to inoculate children in the womb, why give it to girls starting at 15 years? You cannot get married till you are 18.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The usual way to vaccinate children is to wait till they are six weeks old.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nBut it is the five-vaccination regime that is most alarming. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only time tetanus vaccine has been given in five doses is when it is used as a carrier in fertility regulating vaccines laced with the pregnancy hormone, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) developed by WHO in 1992.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIt is HCG that has been found in all six samples sent to the University of Nairobi medical laboratory and another in South Africa. The bishops and doctors warn that injecting women with HCG , which mimics a natural hormone produced by pregnant women, causes them to develop antibodies against it. When they do get pregnant, and produce their own version of HCG, it triggers the production of antibodies that cause a miscarriage.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We knew that the last time this vaccination with five injections has been used was in Mexico in 1993 and Nicaragua and the Philippines in 1994,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Dr. Ngare. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause miscarriages till three years later,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which is why, he added, the counterclaims that women who got the vaccination recently and then got pregnant are meaningless.\nNgare said WHO tried to bring the same anti-fertility program into Kenya in the 1990s. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We alerted the government and it stopped the vaccination. But this time they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nNgare also contrasted the secrecy of this campaign with the usual fanfare accompanying national vaccination efforts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They usually bring all the stakeholders together three months before the campaign, like they did with polio a little while ago. And they use staff in all the centres to give out the vaccine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But with this anti-tetanus campaign, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only a few operatives from the government are allowed to give it out. They come with a police escort. They take it away with them when they are finished. Why not leave it with the local medical staff to administer?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nBrian Clowes of Human Life International in Virginia told LifeSite News that WHO was not involved in the Nicaragua, Mexican and Philippines campaigns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They try to maintain a spotless record. They let organizations like United Nations Population Fund and USAID do the dirty work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIn the previous cases, said Clowes, the vaccinators insisted their product was pure until it was shown not to be. Then they claimed the positive tests for HCG were isolated, accidental contaminations in the manufacturing process.\nLifeSiteNews has obtained a UN report on an August 1992 meeting at its world headquarters in Geneva of 10 scientists from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Australia, Europe, India and the U.S.A\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and 10 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health advocates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from around the world, to discuss the use of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fertility regulating vaccines.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It describes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the most advanced. \u00c2\u00a0\nOne million Kenyan women and girls have been vaccinated so far with another 1.3 million to go. The vaccination is targeting women, according to the government, in order to inoculate their children in the womb against tetanus as well. The government says 550 children die of tetanus yearly.\nIn covering the contest of words the pro-government Nation found plenty of women who had been vaccinated and were now pregnant, even one who was the wife of a former Catholic priest who left the Church to marry. The paper ignored Kenya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reliance on the Catholic medical system, while setting the bishops\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stand in a questionable historical context of irrational responses \u00e2\u20ac\u0153largely based on religious beliefs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the more recent murder of vaccination teams in Nigeria, and even of CIA conspiracy theories.\nWhy would the UN want to suppress the population in developing countries? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Racism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is Brian Clowes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first explanation.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Also, the developed countries want to get hold of their natural resources.

Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, told reporters on Jan. 10 that President-elect Donald Trump asked him to chair a commission on vaccine safety, CNN reported.\n \tWhile Trump's team denied making the specific request that Kennedy referenced, a spokeswoman said that Trump is considering forming a commission on autism, reported CNN and other outlets.\n \tThe Trump team's response, which brought up autism in response to a question about a vaccine committee, appears to draw a connection between the condition and vaccines, despite overwhelming evidence debunking the claim that vaccines cause autism. [5 Dangerous Vaccination Myths]\n \t\"Claims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature,\" the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement released on Jan. 10, in response to the news reports.\n \tA 2016 study in the journal Pediatrics found that more parents are refusing to vaccinate their children now than a decade ago. Interestingly, the study also found that the percentage of parents who were concerned about the autism link has dropped in recent years. In 2006, 74 percent of pediatricians said the supposed link was a top reason for parents' refusal to vaccinate, but in 2013, only 64 percent of pediatricians said the same.\n \tStill, beliefs about the much-discredited link persist \u00e2\u20ac\u201d why? \u00c2\u00a0\n \tThe anti-vaccination viewpoint is a product of two colliding ideas, Jennifer Reich, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Denver told Live Science in March, 2016.\n \tFirst, parents may think that they \"are in this alone\" and not responsible in any small way for other children in their communities, said Reich, who is the author of \"Calling the Shots: Why Parents Reject Vaccines\" (NYU Press, 2016). In other words, these parents don't feel that it's important to contribute to herd immunity, which protects individuals in a community who are unable to receive vaccines, Reich said.\n \tSecond, there is an idea that individuals hold all responsibility for their own health, and that society bears none for people's health decisions, Reich said.\n \tTogether, these beliefs may lead parents to view it as their duty to go it alone, and combine individual parenting with individualized health care, Reich said. These parents may spend a substantial amount of time researching information about vaccines and deciding whether the information applies to their children, she said.\n \t\u00c2\u00a0\"They begin to doubt whether population data [on vaccine safety] applies to their own families,\" she said.\n \tReich also noted that parents may believe that the diseases prevented by vaccines are not very serious. For example, parents may think that if their children do get sick with the measles, they will not develop the severe complications, such as encephalitis or deafness, that the disease can bring, she said.\n \tIndeed, the 2016 Pediatrics study showed an increased in the percentage of pediatricians who said that parents refused to vaccinate their children because of a perception that the vaccines were unnecessary.\n \tAnother study, published in 2014 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that peer pressure plays a role in vaccination rates but can act as a double-edged sword. For example, social norms can keep vaccination rates high, even in the absence of obvious disease risk, but if people become scared of a vaccine risk, social norms can keep vaccination rates depressed long after the scare ends, the study found.\u00c2\u00a0\n \tOriginally published on Live Science.\n","125":"Childhood vaccines protect children from a variety of serious or potentially fatal diseases, including diphtheria, measles, polio and whooping cough (pertussis). If these diseases seem uncommon \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or even unheard of \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's usually because these vaccines are doing their job.\nStill, you might wonder about the benefits and risks of childhood vaccines. Here are straight answers to common questions about childhood vaccines.\nA natural infection might provide better immunity than vaccination \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but there are serious risks. For example, a natural chickenpox (varicella) infection could lead to pneumonia. A natural polio infection could cause permanent paralysis. A natural mumps infection could lead to deafness. A natural Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection could result in permanent brain damage. Vaccination can help prevent these diseases and their potentially serious complications.\nVaccines do not cause autism. Despite much controversy on the topic, researchers haven't found a connection between autism and childhood vaccines. In fact, the original study that ignited the debate years ago has been retracted.\n","126":"\u00c2\u00bb Download a printable PDF of this document.\n There are two types of laws, statutes and regulations, that mandate actions in the state of Mississippi to prevent and control rabies.  State statutes are laws enacted by a legislative body and these are listed first.  Regulations are orders issued by an executive authority of a government and have the force of law. These are the current rabies laws and regulations for the state of Mississippi. The Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) has the legal authority to promulgate regulations to enforce the rabies law. The State Veterinarian licenses the vaccines that are approved by MSDH and regulates rabies requirements for animals entering the state of Mississippi.  Both agencies follow the recommendations set by the Compendium of Animal Rabies Control promulgated and updated by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians.\n41-53-1. Rabies inoculation of dogs and cats required.\n Every person in the state of Mississippi who owns, or has in his or her possession, any dog or cat of the age of three (3) months or over shall have said dog or cat inoculated (vaccinated) against rabies as provided herein with the recommended dosage of an anti-rabic virus (vaccine) approved by the State Board of Health, and it shall be unlawful for any person within the state of Mississippi to own or have in his or her possession within the state of Mississippi any dog or cat three (3) months of age or over which has not been inoculated (vaccinated) against rabies with the approved dosage of an approved anti-rabic virus (vaccine).

For a failure to comply with this section said person shall be subject to the penalties provided in Section 41-53-13. \n41-53-5. Who may administer virus.\n All inoculations (vaccinations) done in accordance with this chapter must be done by either a licensed veterinarian or other competent person granted a permit to administer virus (vaccine) by the State Board of Health.\n41-53-7. Tags.\n It shall be the duty of the manufacturer or manufacturers contracted with to furnish virus (vaccine) to furnish with each ampoule (dose) of virus (vaccine), a suitable metal tag approved by the state board of health, which may be securely bradded to the collar of the dog inoculated (vaccinated).  Said tag shall have stamped thereon the serial number of vaccination and the year in which said dog was inoculated.  This tag shall be furnished to the owner when said dog is inoculated (vaccinated), and it shall be his duty to securely attach same to the collar, and each dog owned by or in the possession of any person within the state of Mississippi shall wear at all times a collar or other device which shall have securely bradded on to it the metal tag provided for above.  Any such tag shall not be transferable to any dog other than the dog for which it was issued.\n41-53-9.  Certificate of inoculation; records.\n All persons administering virus (vaccine) in accordance with this chapter shall furnish the owner of each dog or cat inoculated (vaccinated) a certificate of inoculation (vaccination) for each dog or cat inoculated (vaccinated) indicating the breed of each dog or cat inoculated (vaccinated), the sex of each dog or cat inoculated (vaccinated), and the markings and the serial number of the tag attached to the collar or some other device on each dog.  Persons administering virus (vaccine) in accordance with this chapter shall maintain records of each inoculation, indicating the owner of each dog or cat inoculated (vaccinated), the breed of each dog or cat inoculated (vaccinated), the sex of each dog or cat inoculated (vaccinated ), and the markings and serial number of the tag furnished to the owner of each dog.\n41-53-11.

The measures proposed in the sixteenth or later edition of the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, published by the American Public Health Association shall be considered as supplementary. \n (Number 12 in this section refers to Rabies)\n12.  Rabies\n             Class 1 case report required. (Class 1 diseases are of major public health importance which shall be reported directly to the State Department of Health by telephone within 24 hours of first knowledge or suspicion.  Class 1 diseases and conditions are dictated by requiring an immediate public health response).\nControl in Animals\n             The Mississippi State Department of Health subscribes to the Compendium of Animal Rabies Control, parts I, II, and III, prepared annually by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians.  The provisions of this compendium have been endorsed by the CDC, U.S. Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services; the American Veterinary Medical Association; the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists; and other public and private agencies.  The following are state specific modifications to the Compendium.\nVaccine Administration\n             All animal rabies vaccines are restricted to use by or under the supervision of a veterinarian or person specifically licensed or designated by the State Board of Health to administer rabies vaccine.\nVaccine Selection\n             The current Compendium lists vaccines licensed for use in the United States.  Only licensed vaccines shall be used.  Vaccines selected for immunizing dogs and cats shall be licensed as providing 3-year immunity.\nWildlife Vaccination\n             Vaccination of wildlife is not recommended since no vaccine is licensed for use in wild animals.  Offspring of wild animals bred with domestic dogs or cats are considered wild animals.\nPre-Exposure Vaccination\n             Dogs and Cats**\n        All dogs and cats shall be vaccinated against rabies at three months of age, revaccinated one year later and every three years thereafter, using a rabies vaccine approved as providing a 3-year immunity.\n        Post-Exposure Management\n        Any animal bitten or scratched by a wild, carnivorous mammal or bat that is not available for testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies.\n     Dogs, Cats, and Ferrets\n        Unvaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately.  If the owner is unwilling to have this done, the animal should be placed in strict isolation for 6 months and vaccinated 1 month before being released.  Animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Dogs, cats, and ferrets that are currently vaccinated should be revaccinated immediately, kept under the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control, and observed for 45 days.\nManagement of Animals that Bite Humans\n        A healthy dog, cat or ferret that bites a person shall be confined and observed for 10 days in a manner acceptable to the local health officer or his or her designee.  Rabies vaccine shall not be administered during the observation period.  Such animals shall be evaluated by a veterinarian at the first sign of illness during confinement.  Any illness in the animal shall be reported immediately to the local health department.  If signs suggestive of rabies develop, the animal shall be euthanized, its head removed, and the head shipped under refrigeration to the State Department of Health Laboratory for examination.  Any stray or unwanted dog, cat or ferret that bites a person may be euthanized immediately, in lieu of 10 days of observation, and the head submitted as described above for examination.\n Animals other than dogs, cats, or ferrets that might have exposed a person to rabies should be reported immediately to the health department.  This is not to include low risk animals such as small rodents and lagomorphs (e.g., squirrels, rats, mice, gerbils, and rabbits).  Prior vaccination of an animal does not preclude the necessity for euthanasia and testing if the period of virus shedding is unknown for that species.  Management of animals other than dogs, cats, and ferrets depends on the species, the circumstances of the bite, the epidemiology of rabies in the area, and the biting animal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history, current health status, and potential for exposure to rabies.  The need for euthanizing and testing the animal shall be decided upon consultation with the Division of Epidemiology.  Post-exposure management of persons should follow the recommendations of the ACIP.\n* Although ferrets are not mentioned in this section, the Compendium of Animal Rabies Control and Prevention does recommend that ferrets be prevaccinated and therefore it is a recommendation of the State Board of Health as well.\nFor questions call your local health department or the State Epidemiologist at 601-576-7725\nAnimal Rabies Control \n        The Board of Animal Health adopts as a regulation the Compendium of Animal Rabies Control as promulgated and amended by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, with the exception that 1 year rabies vaccines are not allowed for use in dogs and cats in Mississippi. \nVaccine Administration\n             All animal rabies vaccines are restricted to use by or under the supervision of a veterinarian or person specifically licensed or designated by the State Board of Health to administer rabies vaccine. \nEntry Requirements by the Mississippi Board of Animal Health\n             \u00c2\u00bb Dogs\n        All dogs three (3) months of age and older transported or moved into the state for any purpose shall be accompanied by an official health certificate with the following compliance: \n\u00c2\u00bb Cats\n        All cats three (3) months of age and older transported or moved into the state for any purpose shall be accompanied by an official health certificate with the following compliance: \n","127":"Shots may hurt a little, but the diseases they can prevent are a lot worse.  Some are even life-threatening. Immunization shots, or vaccinations, are essential. They protect against things like measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). Immunizations are important for adults as well as children.\nYour immune system helps your body fight germs by producing substances to combat them. Once it does, the immune system \"remembers\" the germ and can fight it again. Vaccines contain germs that have been killed or weakened. When given to a healthy person, the vaccine triggers the immune system to respond and thus build immunity. \nBefore vaccines, people became immune only by actually getting a disease and surviving it. Immunizations are an easier and less risky way to become immune. \n","128":"Vaccination has become as much as a social and emotionally-driven debate as it has been a medical one.\nOne in which the risks, misinformation, and personal experiences have all played a part.\nFor whether you're pro-vaccination or anti, your decision as a parent regarding immunisation may affect others and their health.\nOne mum recently has highlighted this potential impact, as she shared her heartbreaking story.\nHaving lost her daughter over two years ago, her grief has prompted her to speak out about the situation leading to her death.\n\"I loved her more than anything in the world.\"\n\"Three years ago I had a baby girl, her name was Emily and I loved her more than anything in this entire f***** up world,\" began the mum and Reddit user throwaway44321424 .\nBy her own admission, the mum had wondered if the pregnancy was something she should go with, given what was happening in her life at the time.\n\"But in the end,\" she continued, \"I planned things out and did everything to make sure I could afford her and we wouldn't be living in poverty.\n\"I did everything I could for my baby with doctors visits and medicine and working a s*** retail job at eight months pregnant all by myself just so I could bring some happiness into my life.\"\nRelated video - Mother posts footage of her baby's severe whooping cough in response to anti-vaccination lobbyists\nWith her daughter's arrival in October, the mum felt it was anew start for their little family. she was born in October and was so so beautiful.\n\"Then when she was eight months old, too young yet for an MMR shot, she got sick.\"\nThe US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recommends children get their first dose against measles at 12 months old.\n\"She was sick for a while and I'd never seen anything like it.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve addressed the ridiculousness that is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd here, and here.\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re as tired of the bullying as I am, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to stand up for our rights and take the world back. \u00c2\u00a0We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to listen to hate speech because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made a different medical decision.\nFirst, sign this petition. \u00c2\u00a0It protects our rights to make our own medical decisions. \u00c2\u00a0It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around 2300 signatures right now; let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get it to 10,000! \u00c2\u00a0You can sign if you fully  vaccinate, partially, or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as long as you believe parents should have the right to make that decision for themselves.\nSecond, share the facts. \u00c2\u00a0Feel free to copy and paste any of the facts from above (citations are hyperlinked) and share them on any threads where people are blaming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-vaxxers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or getting nasty or scared over the measles. \u00c2\u00a0Help to correct the misinformation. \u00c2\u00a0Feel free to share this post, too.\nThird, speak up. \u00c2\u00a0If people are being rude, call them out. \u00c2\u00a0Be respectful, but say something. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We all make different medical decisions for our children. \u00c2\u00a0The evidence is not clear cut. \u00c2\u00a0Being rude isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to change anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m asking you to stop talking to others like this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00c2\u00a0I suggest deleting and banning anyone who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remain civil. \u00c2\u00a0If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ready, share some information on your personal Facebook profile, or talk to friends in person. \u00c2\u00a0Remain calm and let everyone know how hurtful and harmful this sort of negative attitude is.\nFourth, report hate pages. \u00c2\u00a0There are a number of different ones on Facebook. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anti-Vax Wall of Shame.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Things Anti-Vaxxers Say.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Banned by Modern Alternative Mama.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00c2\u00a0There are many others. \u00c2\u00a0Report them for hate speech. \u00c2\u00a0Their entire purpose is to take screenshots from groups where they troll and mock the people \u00e2\u20ac\u201d some of you may recognize your own comments being mocked on those pages!\nFifth, write to your Congress representatives and let them know how important preserving\/adding to  vaccine exemptions is to you, and preserving medical freedom. \u00c2\u00a0Search \u00e2\u20ac\u0153state representatives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153state senators\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to find your state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, and your local representatives. \u00c2\u00a0In some states there are specific efforts underway; check www.nvic.org for updates on these.\nStand up for your rights, or others will take them from you. \u00c2\u00a0We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow that.\nEDIT: Plenty of people are upset that I noted that we could see up to 800 measles deaths annually if no one vaccinated. \u00c2\u00a0First, that will never happen \u00e2\u20ac\u201d because unlike some people, I believe everyone should have a *choice* in their medical care, and many will choose to  vaccinate. \u00c2\u00a0That is fine. \u00c2\u00a0(Although vaccination isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t 100%, as we all know.) \u00c2\u00a0Second, those people completely ignored that there are currently 400,000 deaths annually from\u00c2\u00a0preventable medical mistakes. \u00c2\u00a0I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how this is acceptable, but even *one* death from the measles is not. \u00c2\u00a0Are you serious? \u00c2\u00a0Where is your commonsense? \u00c2\u00a0How can you be angrier about theoretical deaths than hundreds of thousands of\u00c2\u00a0actual deaths? \u00c2\u00a0I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wrap my brain around that one.\nFinally, if you post nastiness and hate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as many have attempted to do \u00e2\u20ac\u201d don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect it to get published. \u00c2\u00a0It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. \u00c2\u00a0Call me Hitler, Stalin, Kim Jong Il, a baby killer, whatever you want. \u00c2\u00a0I control what gets posted here. \u00c2\u00a0Keep it civil or you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never see it live.\nI have to say, I love how the statistics you quote come straight from the CDC and other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153credible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sources; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying I discount the websites that are blatantly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-vax,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but I know a lot of other people do, especially the kinds of people who are posting and reposting all of the hateful posts out there right now.  \nGreat post! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m disgusted with the behavior I have been seeing over the last couple of years. Ironically, these bullies are the very reason I started questioning vaccines in the first place. I was pretty pro-vax until I saw the hateful backlash that happened to any medical professional that dared to speak against the mainstream medical (i.e., big pharma funded) community. I have even see some of these people whip each other up and encourage each other to make false claims to CPS, removing healthy children from loving homes and putting them in overcrowded foster care systems where they are then more likely to be exposed to all kinds of neglect and abuses. (There are certainly some wonderful foster families out there and I know some, but the norm is that these kids do not do well.) CPS and DHS should not have their time and resources taken away from kids who are suffering from true neglect and abuse and it makes me sick that these pieces of garbage are so attached to their vaccine dogma that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consider that. \nWe can manage some of the negative effects trolling and cyber-bullying is having on us by remember to unplug. Step away from the hate. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re experiencing it in your personal world by pressure from family members, refuse to discuss the issue. As I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve told my very well-meaning family members \u00e2\u20ac\u0153my child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s medical history is between us and him and his physician. We are not going to discuss it with you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to answer general questions, debate information as long as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civil, but they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a say in this. Simple as that. \nMay we remember to focus our energy on the the things that matter (demanding *real* safety studies, pushing for legislation to protect our rights and hold vaccine manufactures financially accountable for the products, for example). All this arguing is a distraction. \nIt is said that one day the Buddha was walking through a village. A very angry and rude young man came up and began insulting him, saying all kind of rude words.\nThe Buddha was not upset by these insults. Instead he asked the young man, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tell me, if you buy a gift for someone, and that person does not take it, to whom does the gift belong?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe Buddha smiled and said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is correct. And it is exactly the same with your anger. If you become angry with me and I do not get insulted, then the anger falls back on you. You are then the only one who becomes unhappy, not me. All you have done is hurt yourself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe way that some of this has come about is unfortunate. It is clear that anyone who believes so strongly in anything would not change their stance so readily, especially when opponents do so in an attacking and self-righteous manner. I would like to apologize on behalf of such people, as over time they have forced you and others to take an extreme position. I do not believe that you, or anyone who follows you and the anti-vaccination movement, wishes to harm children, you are trying to do the opposite. However, I invite you to consider other sides of your arguments and their basis before disregarding them. I would like everyone to keep an open dialogue about the issues involved in order to solve them for the future. Thank you everyone, please keep an open mind and respectful dialogue while we all work out the issues.\nHere ya go:\nVaccinations aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for preventing. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a medical assistant and too many people get that miss info. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s keep you from having fatal symptoms like blindness, men not able to have kids as adults and death. Works the same with the flu. It means you can still get it but a softer case of it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in the middle. I gave my son some of the vaccines but not all of them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hard subject. I struggle with it all the time. I hear so any things. I mean I was told other things with raising my son and have sort of proved them wrong. Maybe my son is one of the exceptions. I had to bottle feed my son. I was told that breastfeeding will help them not get sick as much. My son is rarely sick. My brothers kids are breastfed and seems they get sick all the time. I found out about this whole vaccine thing after I gave my son the vaccinations. Even not knowing he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive four of them. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just in the middle. As a health care professional  I see the pro vaccination side of it and on the other hand is see the right to choose has valid points too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overwhelming sometimes. But hate is stupid. We live in a free county for a reason to live freely and raise our children we think is best. Hate and bullying is never the answer to anything.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to know who said they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for preventing disease. Are they health related professionals or is it others who have automatically assumed it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to prevent. Wrong info can spread like wild fire and then cam be considered what is. In all my classes every single one of my professors have drilled it into our minds about vaccinations because because we have to be advocates on the information about what we are doing or giving them. If you look at every single adverse side affect in every procedure done or down to things over the counter people would not do anything. You know in studies, even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one person out of thousands who who get that side effect, they have to legally list that as a possible side effect but it is listed as rare. The ingredient that everyone said is toxic was a preservative that the FDA pulled from being allowed to use I believe  it was like 2006. Yes it may happen but you have a higher chance of your child dying from a car crash then from them having adverse side effects from vaccines. I just want to make sure true info is being put out there. I have no problems with parents not vaccinating or vaccinating. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your right as a parent but please make sure you really get all info that is considered non biased.\nKate,  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wondering what proof would be enough for you?  I agree bullying doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work but it seems that evidence doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t either.  What proof and from whom would be enough to prove to you that if your children are healthy, you should vaccinate them?  99% of the pediatricians in this country support vaccinations, 100% of scientists support them, and so do a vast majority of parents.  That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough evidence for me but obviously not for you.  What would it take for you to change your mind?  If 99% of pediatricians told me that vaccines were not safe, I would believe them.  They were trained (for years) to protect and heal our children so when essentially every last one of them tells me that vaccines are safe for healthy children, I believe them.  Oddly enough they all also vaccinate their own children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so that old \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are in big pharma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd either makes them psychopaths or willing to risk their own children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives.  If you believe that about pediatricians, I certainly hope you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring your children to one.\nMy personal struggle is because after deciding to vax (selectively, slowly, not really believing in it) and taking all sorts of heat for not doing it the usual way, my daughter had an adverse reaction to IPV, her first shot.  The doctor we first took her to pooh poohed it and gave her the first shot of the DTaP series, and she reacted again.  So suddenly I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a credible person, because we have a history of adverse reactions.  But my original hesitancy to vax was not respectable, even though it turned out to be well-founded.  The lack of respect has been astounding to me.\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also frustrating that while the angry voices say I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m okay, an exception to the rule, when they say there should be criminal liability, or that unvaxed kids should be prohibited from attending school (or Disney world!), if they are being consistent, they have to include my unvaxed kids, who are every bit as dangerous as the unvaxed kids whose parents simply chose not to, before they had any adverse effects to wave around.\nI am not angry. I will not be hateful. I am simply stating a few facts from the other side which I do hope you please share. I have never gotten upset at another persons choice to not vaccinate. Ever. When I was a child I was exposed to the chicken pox so my friend and I could be sick together too. Guess what happened? The virus caused a seizure. The seizure caused a benign lesion in my brain and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had epilepsy ever since. This is not a pity party. It has made me the person I am today  So many things could be so much worse. I know a woman who because of the measles developed an autoimmune disorder and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to conceive. Had 2 terrible miscarriages, one with twins at 5 months. I know of far too many people who have had to avoid others because of illness in their family (cancer, elderly parents, etc.)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they have small children and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have friends over if they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinated or if their children were not of the age yet to get the vaccines making them vulnerable to them, at which point making the ill parent (cancer, stem cell recipient) vulnerable to the illness. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m only 35. I feel this is young enough to know far too many people (and this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the entire list) which this affected. My father got whooping cough when my son was born 4 years ago and he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet him until he was 2 months old (they live 10 miles away). Like I said. I respect the decisions that other people make, but I do find it frustrating at the same time. To say that there are just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd examples is very hard for me to hear when I know so many people that have been affected by that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd population. I do realize it sure sounds like all I know is a bunch of sick people, that is not the case. I live in a place where many people choose not to vaccinate and this is the result. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had entire preschools shut down because the entire (entire) school came down with whooping cough. Now, think about the fact that when the child gets sick it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just the child. The siblings (if there are any) get sick as well. The parents (who then have to miss work) the other people they have come in contact with, if the sibling goes to another school and the siblings go to a different school where they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t immunized then it is then spreading there to those families (parents, siblings, people they have come in contact with \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what if they have older siblings who go to different schools). Then what about the co-workers of the parents? This is the mindset of the pro-vaccine people. Much of the time people are too upset to bother explaining any of it. I know it sounds like a big conspiracy theory. If you stop and think about how the common cold is spread, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same. The exact same, but the illness are so much more powerful and when we have the gift (how our side views it) of prevention (when people like me have had unfortunate lifelong side effects from them) we snatch them up.\n I really hope you choose to post this seeing how I have put this in the kindest way I know how.\nWhen making our decision, we called the CDC (whom I will not call a reputable source for anything, but maybe a vaccine agenda monger).  I was particularly wanting statistical facts regarding the hib b vaccine. My specific question was: in any given recent year of the cases of meningitis that could have been prevented by the vaccine, how many of the cases reported of infected were vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. Their response was, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do not keep that kind of data and if we did, it is a hippa violation to release any information.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  I like facts, statistics and truth.  The pro vaxxers think an unvacinated child poses a threat to their child.  The logic is bad fundamentally. If vaccines worked no amount if unvaccinated would pose a threat. Thank you for your article.\nHi Kate. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a physician, and I just wanted to address one thing you mentioned:  the preventable medical errors that happen in hospitals. They do happen, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unacceptable. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak for every hospital, of course, but I can promise you that the hospital system in which I work, those are taken VERY seriously.  When one happens, it is not covered up.  It is discussed, reviewed, and reviewed again. Root cause analysis meetings are held to determine what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again. Let me give you an example:  in our Neonatal ICU (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a neonatologist) we were having an unacceptably high rate of central line-associated bloodstream infections. We had 3 or 4 in a six month period. Not okay, period. We met, discussed, reviewed, and changed our practices. This July 4th will be FOUR YEARS without an infection!  We are very proud of this change and have worked very hard to maintain that status. \nIt doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter who lives and who dies, or if anyone at all dies this time.  People die of Measles and the other diseases that are making a comeback because of the anti-vaccination movement.  These diseases are becoming a problem again because people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get vaccinated and then they keep the virus alive.  These illnesses were beaten down with vaccines and are growing again because people choose not to get them.  The more people get the disease the more people will die from it.  That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics for you.  A certain percentage of people die from a disease; if more people have it, more people die.  People that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afraid of diseases because their kids are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153healthy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are deluding themselves.  Every kid is healthy, until they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not.  Herd immunity is only effective if over 95% of the population is resistant to the disease.  Thanks to the anti-vaccination movement this number is just over 70% and dropping.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got news for you people, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all be in the 5%.  You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better get concerned with infection, because this outbreak could be mild, but the next one could be the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic all over again, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spread by people who get infected and pass it on and keep it alive.\nThank you for being open about your beliefs, reasons, and science for this very complicated decision.  I do not have children yet, though we are trying, and so I decided to start researching some of these issues so that I would know my position when the time came.  This issue is by far the most difficult\/complicated one I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m struggling with.  The evidence-based part of me comes down on the site of not vaccinating, mostly because I think that the vaccine manufacturers have the burden of proof of safety, efficacy, and necessity and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just not convinced they have it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this bullying\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this INSANITY\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. and I lose my confidence that not vaccinating is the right decision.  If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m honest, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m VERY strongly motivated to vaccinate simply because I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to have to have this fight their whole lives\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. how terrible of a reason is THAT?! All this name-calling and fear-mongering does nothing but obscure the facts that everyone has a right to so that we can make educated and informed decisions about what we put in our bodies.  I really appreciate that you are so outspoken about this issue so that those of us out here have some place to start finding real data to make this very important decision for ourselves and our family.\nI disagree with your post on many levels, but in aim of brevity and constructive conversation:  I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but find your post to be hypocritical.  Please try to understand why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m saying this, as it is not a personal attack, just something I think you should try to be aware of.  There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much hypocrisy in demanding your right to be heard, while signing petitions against others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights to voice opposite opinions.  Also, keep in mind that everyone has a choice.  If your choice is to NOT vaccinate your children, you must accept the (potential) consequences.  Which could be as extreme as illness (again, POTENTIAL consequence) or as inconvenient as not being able to register with some schools, churches, doctors offices, etc.  As it is the equally valid right of people and places to limit access to children that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t participating in herd immunity.  Everyone has a right to choose.  You have a right to chose not to vaccinate and take action how you feel necessary, no matter how much others disagree.  And others have the right to disagree, or take action how they feel necessary, no matter how much YOU disagree.\nI know you will not publish this comment, as you have stated above, but I hope you take the time to read this article and consider the other side of the issue. Not vitriolic arguments and accusations against you, which as you say are completely unproductive.  I agree. I am instead asking you to re-evaluate your beliefs with new information in hand. Do not limit your research to evidence which supports your existing beliefs, but truly evaluate the core reasoning, and ramifications to real, loving, kind, and deserving people, who rely on their community of friends, neighbors, peers, and families, to keep them safe, as we ALL do, in many ways. \nThe biggest problem is that you assume that the idea that herd immunity, the general idea that my child could impact another\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health, is a NEW idea to me.  Do you realize hundreds and hundreds have yelled this at me?  Some respectfully (like you) and some\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6well, I just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t repeat what they said.  This is NOT NEW to me whatsoever.  I do not even understand how someone could even think that it would be when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s they key focus of the propaganda that is published multiple times a day.\nI read that story.  And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the thing: that child is at risk from SICK PEOPLE, not unvaccinated people.  Do you understand the difference?  His father clearly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.  A lot of kids show up to school with bad colds, strep throat, bronchitis (even if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that bad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), stomach viruses, etc.  This is the real danger.  They should be advising kids in his son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s class to err on the side of caution and stay home if they have any symptoms.  And, they should be having the boy wear a mask because these illnesses we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have vaccines for could be just as deadly as the ones we do, in this case.\nShould any child get exposed to the measles, or even think they might have been (vaccinated or not), they should stay home.  Sure.  But there is still the possibility that a vaccinated child could catch and spread measles (or pertussis, also common because of massive vaccine failure \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I could pull up half a dozen recent studies on that easily).  Or that ANY child could bring in strep throat (which in a child with cancer could lead to scarlet fever and death).\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to know who said they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for preventing disease. Are they health related professionals or is it others who have automatically assumed it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to prevent. Wrong info can spread like wild fire and then cam be considered what is. In all my classes every single one of my professors have drilled it into our minds about vaccinations because because we have to be advocates on the information about what we are doing or giving them. If you look at every single adverse side affect in every procedure done or down to things over the counter people would not do anything. You know in studies, even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one person out of thousands who who get that side effect, they have to legally list that as a possible side effect but it is listed as rare. The ingredient that everyone said is toxic was a preservative that the FDA pulled from being allowed to use I believe  it was like 2006. Yes it may happen but you have a higher chance of your child dying from a car crash then from them having adverse side effects from vaccines. I just want to make sure true info is being put out there. I have no problems with parents not vaccinating or vaccinating. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your right as a parent but please make sure you really get all info that is considered non biased.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m SOOO glad to see someone else able to view this with a rational mind. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out why everyone is upset about the unvaccinated people getting Measles\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and not a word about the vaccinated people getting it. Seriously? Nothing to say? Schools not letting unvaccinated kids attend for 2 weeks? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry, but if there were an outbreak somewhere, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want my vaccinated kids included either\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not invincibility. Who knows that they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the 5% the MMR doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work on? Sooo, we only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153care\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the unvaccinated kids but not the risk for the vaccinated? The whole thing is ridiculous. I would love more people to set aside their propaganda and take an honest look at this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 one that does\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involve serious kick-backs and national funding and actually considers what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best for kids\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and lets us parents make that decision. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know a single anti-vaxxer who made that choice flippantly, without a ton of research, or with the hope of being saved by a herd. As you said in a March post\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 ultimately, each parents loves their child (hopefully) and is doing the research and making the best choice for their family, whatever that is. The bullying is ridiculous.\nIf your thinking of vaccinating, great, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got nothing to worry about, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never catch \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd disease, will you, your vaccinated. So why worry, your safe, your children are safe. Vaccinations always work, right ? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never been a recorded complication, right? And if so, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small risk, it wont happen to your child, will it. If however, your unsure, perhaps you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to know the composition of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being injected directly into your soft tissue, or your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, by passing you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re GI tract, or skin for that matter. Well, in that case, ask for an independent analysis, form the an independent laboratory, with the requisite scientific standards in place, guaranteeing, objective, unbiased reporting. Then, you can make an informed decision, right? Or perhaps, ask the medical practitioner to sign off on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that vaccines are 100% safe & effective, making them liable, in case they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face it, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all the same aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we, gene\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or gene expression & genetic mutations couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possibly influence how a foreign synthetic substance will effect our biology & respective response, after all vaccines where designed as a panacea, catering for the whole bell curve, right? If in doubt, you can always fall back on blood letting, or just rub some mercury on your chest; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bound to kill something.\n","130":"By Danielle, Contributing Writer\nYou can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a more controversial topic than  vaccines today. The CDC just released their 2016 Schedule, requiring over 70  vaccines by the age of 18. Considering one flu shot contains 250 times the amount of mercury the EPA considers liquid hazardous waste, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe to say that any amount of  vaccine can, and does, damage a child.\nThe debate is over,  vaccines are toxic and damage your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health.\nBefore we move on, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tackle the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but how many?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd issue. Your pediatrician and his handy marketing piece, the  Vaccine Information Statement (VIS), will tell you that reactions are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one in a million.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Vaccine Adverse Reporting System (VAERS) is where reactions are documented, although there are no requirements for doctors to do so, so the CDC itself admits the reaction statistics are more like 1-10% of the true numbers. In 2014, there were just under 37,000 reports filed filed.\nTimes that by 10 or 100. One in a million? Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think so.\nIf you believe you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen a  vaccine reaction, you probably truly have, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize (or your doctor would not admit) that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you were seeing. Here we will go over the most common reactions (which are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by how often they occur, but are by no means \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when your child swells up, seizes, or dies). \u00c2\u00a0Vaccine reactions can occur anywhere from immediately following  vaccination, such as a swollen arm or leg, fainting or seizing, or for a month or more post  vaccination. Research shows us the most critical days are days 5-7 and 14-16 post  vaccination, where serious reactions are most likely to occur.\n#1 High-Pitched Crying or Arching Back\nHigh-pitched crying and discomfort, such as arching the back when laid down, is a clear indication of encephalitis, brain inflammation, which is a common vaccine reaction. Large amounts of bacteria, viruses, and toxins create a hyper- immune response, prompting severe, sometimes deadly, inflammation in the brain.\nIf your child will not sleep, is uncomfortable, and crying incessantly post vaccination (up to 21 plus days), take them to the emergency room immediately.\nSevere inflammation at the injection site can be a sign of an allergic reaction or other hyper- immune reaction. Review the vaccine insert (before vaccinating) and try to outline what allergy (peanut, milk, egg) may have been created. If your doctor cannot explain what reaction occurred, then you should consider not vaccinating to prevent any further damage.\nRead the vaccine insert before vaccinating, and be sure the doctor is using the correct method of injection. Injecting in the incorrect method can deliver a serious reaction.\nTell me where in nature you would normally be exposed to upwards of ten bacteria and viruses at once? Nope, never. So when your child receives this many  immune threats (accompanied by toxins) at once, your immune system goes into overdrive. \nThis can produce a very high fever, and if the fever moves up or down in temperature fast enough, a febrile seizure. Head to the emergency room, and demand a review of your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health if a febrile seizure or fever lasting over 3 days is seen post vaccination, as other vaccine reactions are likely occurring.\nA rash is simply a toxin leaving your body through your skin. A rash post-vaccination can be caused by the virus vaccinated against (measles, for example), or an allergic reaction producing eczema. If your child develops a rash, monitor the child for the symptoms of the vaccinated virus or bacteria, and consider eliminating any possible allergies created by the vaccine. \u00c2\u00a0Your child may also be detoxing the large quantities of adjuvants in the vaccine through the skin.\nVaccines were designed to sensitize your immune system to viruses and bacteria. Although many immunologists and doctors warn that this process does not work the same via muscular and blood injection versus introducing a substance through normal means of the mouth, nose, and eyes (to pass through your immune system process regularly and the vast immune system in your gut), many still trust in the theory of vaccination.\nWhen you  vaccinate, you are surely sensitizing your child to not only the bacteria and virus, but also the food and chemical additives in the vaccine, which include milk proteins, other human and animal proteins, egg, peanut and much more. If your vaccinated child develops eczema, allergies or asthma, which are all autoimmune responses to allergies, you need to consider stopping vaccination to not worsen the allergy.\nIf your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breathing post vaccination (see suggestion below to get a breathing\u00c2\u00a0monitor and use overnight for at least one month following every round of vaccines, if you  vaccinate) is delayed or slowed, it is cause to make a trip to the emergency room and check for allergic response or brain damage.\nAnaphylactic shock is also a common vaccine reaction, where your airways (or other body systems) go into shock from an autoimmune, allergic response. If your child has responded in this way to vaccines, it is time to stop, and review the possible allergies created.\n#7 Loss of Facial and Eye Symmetry and Itching\/Numbness in Extremities\nWhen your immune system responds to a threat, it produces more white blood cells. Your white blood cells are substantially larger than your red, and this becomes an issue when your immune system is kicked into overdrive and delivers large quantities of white blood cells to your smallest blood vessels, your capillaries. Your capillaries are so small that white blood vessels have to squeeze through one by one.\nThe smallest of these vessels are located in your hands, feet, nose and brain, particularly by the area which controls speech. When too many white blood cells\u00c2\u00a0are released, they cannot squeeze through and the blood and oxygen supply is limited for a period of time, and if severe enough, forever. This causes stroke in the brain, and can be seen by loss of facial asymmetry (one side of the face looks different than the other) and loss of tone around the eyes, cheeks, and mouth.\nYou would also feel this, if happening in your extremities rather your brain, as tingling, burning or numbing. Your child may not be able to articulate this to you, but if you see them generally uncomfortable, struggling with using those parts, or pulling at the parts, I would consider a possible reaction and a trip to the emergency room.\n Photo submitted by parent of vaccine injured child and Healthy Alternatives to Vaccines\nAs noted above, vaccines are designed to sensitize your system to a bacteria or virus. Theoretically, every time you  vaccinate, you get that bacterial or viral illness. If your child falls ill post vaccination, bring them back to your pediatrician and demand that the child be examined for the illness against which they were vaccinated. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that your doctor will ignore your requests and be adamant that the vaccine cannot cause the disease.\nVaccine-strain illnesses, such as asymptomatic measles, are often more serious than the wild version of the disease, so you need to be extra vigilant and require the doctor to treat your child. (If your doctor refuses, take your child to another doctor or to an emergency room. Pride is not a valid reason to not treat a child).\nSince your child will be receiving the bacteria or viral illness vaccinated against, as well as a load of other toxins and allergenic substances, their bodies will try to  detox these substances post vaccination. \u00c2\u00a0This is a vaccine reaction. If your child exhibits vomiting or diarrhea for a day or more post vaccination, have your doctor or an emergency room evaluate the child for the diseases against which they were vaccinated (and treat them for dehydration and the disease).\nA normally functioning child does not regress (lose speech, lose eye contact and social interaction) for no reason. Heavy metal toxicity, loss of oxygen to critical areas of the brain and a body in constant hyper-immune response lead to a child who cannot function and develop. \nIf you notice your child losing abilities once mastered, exhibiting attention or aggression issues, or withdrawing from social interaction, you are likely viewing a vaccine reaction. The good news is that there are many natural ways to  detox and heal vaccine damage. Check out The Thinking Mom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Revolution if this has happened to your child, and explore how you can truly heal against heavy metal, vaccine damage.\n If your child has had a vaccine reaction, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never too late to research vaccines and choose to build natural immunity and a healthy lifestyle instead. You should also look into detoxing from the vaccine toxins. If you still choose to vaccinate, consider a delayed schedule and using a\u00c2\u00a0breathing\u00c2\u00a0monitor.\nIf you suspect damage, do not take \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this could not be from the vaccine you had 3 days ago\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from your doctor. Your child deserves better than a denial of clear symptoms because of pride. Find a doctor who is willing to help you, even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chiropractor, naturopath, or biomedical doctor.\nHave you or your child had a vaccine reaction? How did you heal from it?\nDisclaimer:\u00c2\u00a0I am not a doctor (yet), but you should find one you trust that understands, listens and treats you how you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like.

I am grateful that my daughter is alive after her first set of shots at 2 months old 22 years ago. She screamed turned Blue and started seizing right there at the Dr office. In 94 they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do hep b at the hospital she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a vitiman k shot either. She spent a week in icu and out here the seizures when she was 6. Her pediatrician also never said anything about vaccines again even when I had my son. I told him I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing any vaccines and he agreed because he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know which one my daughter had reacted to. My children both have medical exceptions and will continue. My daughter is pregnant. And her ob\/gyn tried telling her she needed a dtap and fly and she showed him her medical records from when she was two along with the medical exemption she had as a child. He is a smug bastard to say the least.\nMy second child was vaccine injured. In 2007. But , it took me until last year (2015) to realize this and piece it all together. After his 4mo. Vaccinations, he had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on his upper right thigh, 5 days after, I took him into the pediatrics office 4 different times regarding this. I was told 4 different opinions \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flea bites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd..no fleas \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spider bites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd..no spiders .. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153allergic reaction to new laundry soap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ..no new soap.. ..nothing new in his diet, bathing, etc..this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd went on swelling like hives for 3 weeks , his only relief was benadryl.  I knew this was some type of  hives but they had no answers for me. Finally it swelled up so raised and inflamed that I took a picture and pleaded for another Dr. To look at the email picture I was sending them. He Called immediately and asked me to bring my baby in. He brought 3 medical books in the room, comparing pictures, reading a lot .. he said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have been a pediatrician for 20 years and never have I seen this in person. I need to refer him to a dermatologist but I think this is mastocytosis- uticaria pigmentosa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd..he was correct,  that was ultimately my son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diagnosis. What causes this?  I ask\n  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unknown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd..it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very rare..\n eventually it went away (or hid in his mast cells) but I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen it in years. During this same month, we also began noticing his head tilting, out of nowhere. Another diagnosis that month -\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Torticollis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.. cause? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unknown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd also \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rare\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\n  He only had one more round of vaccines after this. After that round, he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153night terrors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so bad that I rushed him in ..what causes this? I ask..\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdunknown cause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. After all this I completely stopped all vaccines.. even though I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure it was best idea at that time , I did that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just in case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \n   Last year when his private school thought that the new law was required vaccines in our state and he needs to be up to date,the laws changed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c (highly incorrect & over my dead body was my exact response). I began researching intensively on vaccines. What I uncovered was horrific.  I have studied this to the fullest and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate a dying animal.\n This past summer I ran across his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153official vaccine record\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ..what was folded inside of it ?  All of his diagnoses & referral(s)- from 2008. All within a 3 month period -All of those issues  From vaccines! He has been to the Dr. One time since that year and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rarely sick, never had an antibiotic and hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t missed a day of school, ever. 3rd grade-age 8. Sorry for this long essay- but to find All these issues listed on the Vaers website, as vaccine injury actually put me through the roof! This has become a passion for me now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to speak truth and knowledge . I always say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If I can save one baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brain- it will all be worth it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThank you so very much for this article, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re awesome!! My son was diagnosed with Complex A typical febrile seizures & has only had the Hepatitis B shot but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m curious if the vaccine did this to him! I vaccinated my daughter for the first year until I realized what vaccines really do to the human body & I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m kicking myself for it. She luckly hasen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had any issues. My son has had Total of 7 seizures & he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 2 1\/2, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done an EEG & it came back normal ( I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the EEG he had though bad doctors & two of the prongs weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even attached!!) We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to look for a new doctor since the one we were seeing refuses to see my children since their unvaccinated ( all they did was tell me febrile seizures are normal!! What!! How are they normal? ) Now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working on getting my son a proper EEG done & making sure him & my daughter are exempt from all these toxic poisions their trying to inject in their body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.  Please keep up with your articles, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very informative & make me feel like I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not alone in this horrible battle.  Once again thank you so much.\nMy 8 year old daughter developed eczema over most of her body after her first vaccine. The doctor told us it was normal. She continued to have eczema for years and then developed allergies and asthma.  She hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had a vaccine in 5 years. She has been seeing a naturopath for 2 years. She healed from 70 food sensitivity through probiotics, l-glutsmine powder. Eating organic. Not consuming a lotof sugar (none for months) some occasionally. She was in a health crisis when I put her on an elimination diet when I realized she had leaky gut from vaccines and dietary factors. As well as from antibiotic use from skin infections re:eczema vaccine injury. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a long road. But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gotten through. Fermented food and grass fed antibiotic hormone free meats. Bone broth. It takes time to dig to the root and heal it from there. But it can be done. Stay strong parents. And try not to feel to guilty. I remind myself that I did the best I could with the information I had when I allowed my child to be vaccinated. And I would and have done everything to bring her body into good health and recovery. The nectar in the poison is that our whole family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way of life has changed for the better because of this. Organic food.  No chemicals or proccessed crap in our food.  No toxic laundry detergent or body care products. Home made everything. Ferments! We all feel better for those changes even though she suffered so much for it.\n","131":"What was I doing in mid-December? I was at Disneyland. What happened at Disneyland during mid-December? A highly contagious, airborne disease was apparently entering the lungs of crowds of people.\nNow, nine Disneyland and Disney California Adventure visitors \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from ages 8 months to 21 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201d are suffering through a case of measles, a totally preventable disease.\nAm I, a self-proclaimed germaphobe and hypochondriac, freaking out right now? No. You know why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not rushing my 8-year-old daughter to the hospital or checking out the symptoms of the measles on WebMD? Because my daughter and I (back in the day) have been vaccinated against the measles. We are safe.\nRELATED: I'm a Vaccine-Wary Mom \nMeasles had been eliminated in 2000, after the vaccinations against the disease became commonplace. But now, thanks to those who are against vaccinations, measles is on the comeback trail. It should be noted that most of those who contracted measles at Disneyland had not been vaccinated. What's tragic is that two of them are too young for the vaccine.\nFirst, I want to defend Disneyland, a place that I love. People are actually blaming the popular park\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe happiest place on earth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor the outbreak. While Disney Parks make sure that there is safety in terms of their rides and crowd control, there is nothing they can do to stop the spread of germs. This outbreak could have happened at a county fair, your local zoo, or a museum \u00e2\u20ac\u201d any place where people congregate.\nDisneyland isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to blame: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the people who have opted themselves and their children out of vaccinations that are.\nOK, I know all those anti-vaxxers peeps are getting their panties in a bunch right now, thinking that vaccinations lead to autism, mind control\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor whatever it is that they believe. But this measles outbreak could have been totally avoided.\nThe Los Angeles Times warned of the spread of measles (and whooping cough) in the U.S. in their piece, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The toll of the anti-vaccination movement, in one devastating graphic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 [I]n the developed world it's an artifact of the anti-vaccination movement, which has associated the vaccine with autism. That connection, promoted by the discredited British physician Andrew Wakefield and the starlet Jenny McCarthy, has been thoroughly debunked. But its effects live on, as the map shows.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On this map, right in the Los Angeles area, is a purple dot showing the presence of measles.\nBottom line: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame the house of the mouse, blame those who opt to not vaccinate.\nRELATED: Vaccinations Shouldn't Be Optional\nSign up for our awesome newsletter ...

The final section presents a preliminary research agenda of possible or putative links in these areas.\nInfection-causing microbes and the vaccines designed to combat them have portions of proteins called antigens. These antigens stimulate a number of cells in the immune system, including macrophages, T cells, and B cells. An immune response begins when macrophages ingest antigens such as proteins entering the body and digest them into antigen fragments. A molecule called MHC (major histocompatibility complex) carries certain of these fragments to the surface of the cell, where they are displayed but they are still locked into the cleft of the MHC molecule. These displayed antigen fragments are recognized by T cells, which stimulate B cells to secrete antibodies to the fragments as well as prompt other immune defenses. According to Berkower, studies suggest that because T cells only recognize antigen fragments from proteins predigested by macrophages, they cannot distinguish between a specific antigen fragment that comes from an infecting microbe and the same antigen fragment that comes from a vaccine (Chisari and Ferrari, 1995).\nStimulated immune cells secrete a variety of chemical substances called cytokines, which determine which class of antibodies are generated. The cytokine interleukin 4, for example, can prompt B cells to secrete immunoglobin E (IgE) antibodies, which trigger allergic reactions. Other cytokines cause B cells to preferentially secrete IgG, which is mainly found in the blood, or IgA, most of which is found in body fluids.\nDifferent MHC molecules bind to different antigen fragments; the set of MHC molecules and the genes that commandeer their production vary widely from one individual to another. Therefore, although the immune systems of two people may respond to the same protein in a vaccine, their T cells may respond to different portions of that protein. This diversity fosters differences in responses to vaccine antigens.\nThere are at least nine chemically distinct classes of immunoglobulins, and the balance of the various types of cytokines that stimulate antibody secretion determines the final response to a vaccine. Consequently, vaccine responses can differ between individuals because the same vaccine stimulates different individuals to generate different amounts of the various cytokines. Vaccine responses might not only differ in the short term, but they could also vary in the\nlong term if they trigger a predominantly IgE response. This response could trigger an allergic reaction to future immunizations with the same antigens (IOM, 1994a).\nTo prevent the body's immune system from destroying its own tissues in what is known as an autoimmune response, immature T cells that react against self-antigens are thought to be destroyed in the thymus gland, creating what is known as central tolerance. Peripheral tolerance might also occur, whereby those T cells that could potentially react to self-antigens and that are not destroyed in the thymus are somehow prevented from causing an autoimmune reaction. Although studies suggest that peripheral tolerance exists, at least in experimental animals, the mechanism for the process is not yet known. If peripheral tolerance exists in people, an autoimmune response might occur in response to vaccination if the vaccine somehow disrupts that peripheral tolerance or if peripheral tolerance is not strong on the day of vaccination (Miller et al., 1989).\nSome people have suggested that vaccines can stimulate autoimmune reactions if some of the antigen fragments in vaccines resemble a person's self-antigens. However, it is unclear why an immune system that is tolerant of its own self-antigens would respond to a self-antigen mimic in a vaccine. Berkower speculated that vaccines might counter peripheral tolerance and foster an autoimmune reaction if they contain molecular mimics of self-antigens that are usually not exposed to T cells, because peripheral tolerance seems to depend on the continuous presence of an antigen.\nNakhasi suggested that an autoimmune response might be instigated by a vaccine or by natural infection if the microbial antigens bind to self-antigens in infected cells and change the antigens' shape such that they are no longer tolerated and can elicit an immune response.\nAccording to McFarland, researchers suspect that molecular mimicry, which could possibly lead to an autoimmune disorder, might be occurring between self-antigens and antigens from microbes or vaccines if the two antigens share much of the same chemical structure. Recent studies suggest, however, that they need to have a similar structure only in the narrow region that binds to the T-cell receptor (Vogt et al., 1994; Wucherpfennig et al., 1994). In addition, the amino acids in this region do not have to be identical; rather studies suggest that they must have the same basic chemical and charge properties (Vogt et al., 1994; Wucherpfennig et al., 1994; Vergelli et al., 1996).\nSome researchers have hypothesized that autoimmune diseases may be stimulated by viruses (Fujinami et al., 1985; Westall and Root-Bernstein, 1983). Westall and Root-Bernstein have postulated that this may occur if three criteria are met. The first one is that antigens are present that have molecular structure similar to self antigens found in certain human tissue (Westall and Root-\nBernstein, 1983). The second one is that an adjuvant derived from walls of the bacterial cells used in the vaccine's manufacture is present. The third one is that antigens exhibiting complimentarity are present. When these three criteria are present an antigenic challenge to the host evokes autoimmunity. This hypothesis has been named Multiple-Antigen-Mediated-Autoimmunity (MAMA) Syndrome. Root-Bernstein has presented evidence that it exists in AIDS patients who develop encephalomyelitis (Sela and Arnon, 1992). Waisbren suggested that the MAMA Syndrome might be a mechanism that induces autoimmunity in susceptible individuals after vaccination with virus components that are also present in human tissue. These antigens may be associated with other complimentary viral antigens and bacterial cell wall components present in the patient who has been vaccinated.\nEach year about 300,000 premature infants are born in the United States, and most of these survive past infancy (Ventura et al., 1996). Preliminary studies suggest that premature large birthweight infants have the same or less risk of experiencing the usual adverse effects reported for full-term infants following vaccination with HBV or DPT (Bernbaum et al., 1989; Koblan et al., 1988; Ramsay et al., 1995; Losonsky, unpublished data). However, recent data with DPT immunization in very low birth weight infants suggest that moderate to severe adverse reactions can occur following routine vaccination with DPT in infants born less than 1,000 grams (Sudhakarow et al., 1996). Routine immunization of extremely premature infants is associated with significant adverse events. According to Losonsky, larger studies that cover the full range of vaccines given to infants need to be done to assess the risk of common adverse events in premature infants.\nCurrent vaccine schedules are based largely on the immune responses seen in full-term rather than premature infants. The human immune system matures throughout fetal life and up until about 2 years of age, however, so even full-term infants do not develop an adequate protective immune response to most vaccines administered in the first weeks of life. Losonsky expressed concern that premature infants given vaccines at the standard times may not develop adequate immunity to the diseases against which the vaccines are designed to protect. There is also speculation that some premature infants might develop immunologic tolerance to the viral or bacterial antigens in vaccines such that\nthey do not develop an immune response to subsequent vaccines given later in life.\nAccording to Losonsky, 98 percent of full-term infants achieve protective immune responses after receiving the third dose of HBV (Losonsky, unpublished data). A study of HBV given to premature infants, however, found that only 54 percent of infants with birth weights of less than 1,000 grams and 70 percent of infants with birth weights of 1,000 to 1,500 grams attained protective immune responses after receiving the third dose of the vaccine. Thirteen of the premature infants with little or no detectable antibody responses to the three doses of HBV were given a fourth dose of the vaccine at 9 to 12 months of age. Only 46 percent of these revaccinated infants achieved protective antibody levels (Losonsky, unpublished data).\nThese data suggest, Losonsky noted, the possibility that tolerance develops in some premature infants. Researchers are following those infants who did not respond to the fourth HBV dose to see if their lack of response is permanent. Other studies suggest that the immune systems of premature infants given DPT and oral polo vaccine at standard times respond as well as those of full-term infants (Koblin et al., 1988; Conway et al., 1993; D'Angio et al., 1995). However, a decreased immune response to some enhanced-potency inactivated polio-oral polio vaccine combinations and to certain Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines was seen in premature infants. The response depended on gestational age and weight at the time of the first immunization (Munoz et al., 1995; D'Angio et al., 1995).\nAccording to Losonsky, these findings suggest that vaccine schedules, dosages, and combinations for preterm infants may have to differ from those for full-term infants. She added that the best schedule and dosage for each vaccine cannot be predicted on theoretical grounds but can only be determined by further study. Care must be taken, she said, not to leave premature infants vaccinated but unprotected from disease. A representative of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) pointed out, however, that the risk of inducing tolerance to vaccination for a specific disease must be balanced with the risk of the infant dying or suffering long-term consequences from natural infection. Premature infants, for example, are more likely to have respiratory abnormalities that may put them at greater risk for complications from the respiratory disease pertussis (whooping cough).\nOn November 6, 1995, the Institute of Medicine's Vaccine Safety Forum convened a workshop on detecting and responding to adverse events following vaccination. Workshop speakers and participants discussed the difficulties in detecting adverse events, current adverse events detection and response methods and procedures, suggestions for improving the means of detecting and responding to adverse events following vaccination, and future areas of research. This document represents a summary of that workshop.\nYou're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

Today, it is 1 in 150 births and still climbing.\nA significant number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder suffer a loss of previously-acquired skills, suggesting neurodegeneration or a type of progressive encephalopathy with an etiological basis occurring after birth.\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the age at which children got their first Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine on autism incidence. This is a reanalysis of the data set, obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), used for the Destefano et al. 2004 publication on the timing of the first MMR vaccine and autism diagnoses.\nBrian S Hooker embarked on a\u00c2\u00a0study to evaluate whether a relationship exists between child age when the first MMR vaccine was administered among cases diagnosed with autism and controls born between 1986 through 1993 among school children in metropolitan Atlanta. The Pearson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chi-squared method was used to assess relative risks of receiving an autism diagnosis within the total cohort as well as among different race and gender categories.\nWhen comparing cases and controls receiving their first MMR vaccine before and after 36 months of age, there was a statistically significant increase in autism cases specifically among African American males who received the first MMR prior to 36 months of age. Relative risks for males in general and African American males were 1.69 (p=0.0138) and 3.36 (p=0.0019), respectively. Additionally, African American males showed an odds ratio of 1.73 (p=0.0200) for autism cases in children receiving their first MMR vaccine prior to 24 months of age versus 24 months of age and thereafter.\nThe present study provides new epidemiologic evidence showing that African American males receiving the MMR vaccine prior to 24 months of age or 36 months of age are more likely to receive an autism diagnosis.\nThere a connection between autism and vaccines and we urge you to keep your child and yourself away from all vaccines. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Nation19 Magazine \/ APDTA\nSr. Government Scientist, Dr. William W.

According to a Jan. 23 Health Advisory issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no source case for the outbreak has been identified.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 2\nThe U.S. has a population of more than 320 million people and 38 million people live in California, so it is curious why a handful of measles cases prompted one California newspaper to quickly place blame on parents making informed vaccine choices, calling them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ignorant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and engaged in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-absorbed rejection of science.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 3 Astroturfers 4 and trolls 5 6 saw that kind of talk as a green light to do more of it on public comment boards, suggesting that children with vaccine-related brain injuries are genetic mutants and calling mothers of vaccine injured children \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153witches.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 7\nDr. James Cherry, 8 a prominent UCLA pediatrician and infectious disease expert, publicly joined in the blame and shame game, hurling insults at parents declining to give children every one of the government recommended 69 doses of 16 vaccines, including two MMR shots. Dr. Cherry said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are some pretty dumb people out there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 9 and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some people are just terribly selfish.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 10\nName-calling is a convenient way to deflect attention from inconvenient truths about vaccine failures and the dissolving myth of vaccine acquired herd immunity. 11\nCase in point: there were 644 cases of measles reported in America in 2014, 12 even though 95% of children entering kindergarten 13 have gotten two doses of MMR vaccine, which is also true for 92% of school children ages 13 to 17 years. 14 Plus, less than one percent of children under age three are completely unvaccinated and 92% of them have gotten one or more MMR shots. 15 In some states, the MMR vaccination rate is approaching 100 percent. 16\nAccording to Dr. Cherry, measles vaccine acquired herd immunity is in effect with a measles vaccination rate of more than 90 percent. 17 Well, that has been true in America since 1981 with one dose of MMR vaccine 18 and since 2000 for two doses of MMR vaccine, which is one reason why the CDC declared measles eradicated from the U.S. in 2000. 19\nBut, clearly, measles virus has not been eradicated from the U.S., just like measles has not been eradicated from any other country and emerging scientific evidence suggests it never will be - no matter how many doses of MMR vaccine are mandated for every man, woman and child in the world. 20 21 22 23\nWhy is a big deal being made out of 51 cases of measles reported in the U.S.?\nPerhaps public health officials would prefer that the media and the public focus on a handful of measles cases at Disneyland and not focus on the fact that millions of Americans have gotten flu shots that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work and health care workers are being fired if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get flu shots that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. 24 25 If you got a flu shot this year, it will do absolutely nothing to protect you from the influenza strain making most people sick. 26 27 28 Worse, scientists have confirmed that the more often you get an annual flu shot, the less effective it is! 29 30\nHow many vaccinated people are attending schools, going to grocery stories and working in hospitals and doctors offices without a clue they are infected with and shedding and transmitting influenza virus because they only have mild flu symptoms or no symptoms at all. 31 32   And it is anybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess how many children are getting sick after live virus influenza vaccine is sprayed up their noses 33 or are shedding vaccine strain live virus that could make other people sick. 34 35\nThe pertussis vaccine is failing, too. 36 37\nLike measles, in recent years there have been huge increases in reports of B. pertussis whooping cough among children and adults in California and other states and many of those people have been vaccinated. 38 39 That was true for pertussis outbreaks in the U.S. 30 years ago, too. 40 41\nNow public health officials are finally admitting the truth that many scientists have been publishing for a long time: you can be fully vaccinated for pertussis, get infected and show atypical or no symptoms and spread whooping cough to vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. 42 43 44\nIn fact, Dr. Cherry himself admits that there are millions of undiagnosed B. pertussis whooping cough cases every year in America, 45 even though 95% or more of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s school children have gotten multiple doses of pertussis containing vaccinations. 46 In 2013, Dr. Cherry wrote, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Neither B. pertussis infection or pertussis vaccination elicit long-lasting immunity. Infection and illness repeatedly occur in all ages throughout life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 47\nSo much for the myth of pertussis vaccine acquired herd immunity. 48\nIt isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very scientific to blame pertussis or influenza outbreaks on unvaccinated people. And it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very scientific to blame measles outbreaks on unvaccinated people, either.\nIn some outbreaks of measles in California last year, nearly 20 percent of the people had been vaccinated. 49 The CDC says that 12% of the measles cases associated with Disneyland were vaccinated, some of them with at least two doses of MMR vaccine. 50\nMeasles vaccine acquired herd immunity is a dissolving myth, too. 51 52 53\nPublic health doctors are scrambling to explain leaks in measles vaccine immunity 54 55 and have come up with this lame excuse: they say they just discovered that 1 measles vaccinated adult in 10 is now susceptible to measles because vaccine immunity wears off. 56 They call it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waning immunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 57\nNow get ready for the sucker punch: Dr. Cherry told a TV network last week that the solution to waning measles vaccine immunity is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153give additional doses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of MMR vaccine to adults. 58 59\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just mandate more MMR shots for millions of Americans and make Merck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stockholders really happy. 60\nBut who is Dr. Cherry kidding? We all know that adults are way too hard to pin down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unless you threaten them with loss of a job or medical care or put them in prison - so I predict that the third MMR shot will more likely target high school students and people trying to get a college education. 61\nDr. Cherry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solution to reported measles cases at Disneyland reminds me of when doctors told parents in 1990 that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize one dose of MMR vaccine would fail to provide lifelong immunity after all, so kids are going to have to get a second dose of MMR. 62\nThe inconvenient scientific truth about measles in Disneyland and around the world is that public health doctors do not know how many vaccinated people can be infected with measles, show few or no symptoms and transmit measles to other people. 63 Government health officials do not conduct rountine active surveillance of vaccinated people to find out if they are experiencing asymptomatic or atypical measles and transmitting it to others.\nIn addition, there are published studies demonstrating that people given live virus measles vaccine can be infected with vaccine strain measles virus and shed vaccine strain measles virus. 64 65 66 Health officials do not conduct routine active surveillance of people getting live MMR vaccine to monitor for vaccine strain measles virus infection, shedding and the potential for transmission.\nMost doctors and parents don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that the CDC warns, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153During outbreaks, measles vaccine is administered to help control the outbreak, and in these situations, vaccine reactions may be mistakenly classified as measles cases. A small proportion of measles vaccine recipients experience rash and fever 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14 days following vaccination. 67\nYes, MMR vaccine can cause vaccine strain measles infection that looks just like measles. 68\nPlus, other common viral infections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like adenovirus infections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can look just like measles with rash, fever and conjunctivitis symptoms 69 70 and be misdiagnosed as measles UNLESS there is expensive RNA lab testing done to confirm that what looks like measles really is wild type measles. 71\nAnd now for the second sucker punch, at least for families living in California: Dr. Pan, the pediatrician politician who lobbied in 2013 to pass a bill restricting non-medical vaccine exemptions for children to attend school, told one California newspaper last week that he intends to introduce new legislation to do more damage to the ability of parents to weigh the benefits and risks of vaccination and make voluntary vaccine choices for their children. 72\nWill California health officials take away religious and conscientious belief vaccine exemptions and leave doctors like Dr. Pan and Dr. Cherry in charge of who gets a public education?\nThe hype about 51 cases of measles reportedly linked to Disneyland 73 has more to do with covering up vaccine failures and propping up the dissolving myth of vaccine acquired herd immunity than it does about protecting the public health. It has a lot to do with defensive doctors trying to blame a minority of parents who are refusing to place irrational faith in them and their moving goal posts, 74 and are choosing instead to think and act rationally. 75\nThat third MMR shot is coming to America and so is a massive Pharma-led lobby attempt to demonize and punish 76 77 all Americans who defend the human right to exercise informed consent to medical risk-taking, including vaccine risk-taking. 78 The calls to strike down those who do not use every dose of the growing list of government-mandated vaccines, is on a fast track.79 80 It will include banning the unvaccinated from exercising the right to get a public education, medical care,81 employment and many other human and civil rights.\nPosted: 1\/28\/2015 5:56:51 PM | with 62 comments\n","136":"What is Chickenpox?\nChickenpox is caused by the varicella zoster virus, which is a member of the herpesvirus family and is associated with herpes zoster (shingles). Chickenpox is highly contagious but for the majority of children it is a mild disease characterized by small round lesions on the skin that cause intense itching. It lasts from two to three weeks and recovery from the disease usually gives permanent immunity to it. Half of all cases occur in children between the ages of 5 and 9. It has been estimated that only 10 percent of Americans over the age of 15 have never had chickenpox.\nCan Chickenpox Cause Injury and Death?\nYes. 3.7 million cases of varicella were estimated to occur in the US annually in the early 1990s. Data from 1992 showed that about 158,000 cases of chickenpox were reported and 100 deaths were reported. More than half of the deaths were in adults because chickenpox is more serious in adults than in children. Up to 20 percent of adults who get chickenpox can develop severe complications such as pneumonia. Other rare complications from chickenpox include serious bacterial infection of the lesions and brain inflammation, which is reported in less than one percent of children who get chickenpox. Most children and adults who develop severe complications from chickenpox disease have compromised immune systems or other health problems.\nWhat is Chickenpox Vaccine?\nThe Varicella Zoster (chickenpox) vaccine is made from the Oka\/Merck strain of live attenuated (weakened) varicella virus. The virus was initially obtained from a child with natural varicella, introduced into human embryonic lung cell cultures, adapted to and propagated in embryonic guinea pig cell cultures, and finally propagated in human diploid cell cultures. The vaccine contains sucrose, phosphate, glutamate and processed gelatin as stabilizers.\nHow Effective is Chickenpox Vaccine?\nAll vaccines only provide temporary immunity. Only recovery from natural chickenpox disease will provide lifelong immunity. When the chickenpox vaccine was licensed for public use in 1995, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimated that it was 70 to 90 percent effective in preventing disease. A recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) study (Dec. 2002) reported that \"the effectiveness of the vaccine was 44 percent against disease of any severity and 86 percent against moderate or severe disease.\" Some are suggesting a second dose of chickenpox vaccine may be needed. Another study in 2002 confirmed that adults exposed to natural chickenpox disease were protected from developing shingles and that there is concern that mass vaccination against chickenpox may cause a future epidemic of shingles, affecting more than 50 percent of Americans aged 10 to 44 years.\nCan Chickenpox Vaccine Cause Injury and Death?\nYes. Between March 1995 and July 1998, the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) received 6, 574 reports of health problems after chickenpox vaccination. That translates into 67.5 adverse events per 100,000 doses of vaccine or one in 1,481 vaccinations. About four percent of cases (about 1 in 33,000 doses) were serious including shock, encephalitis, thrombocytopenia (blood disorder) and 14 deaths. The VAERS data has led to the addition of 17 adverse events to the manufacturer's product label since the vaccine was licensed in 1995, including secondary bacterial infections (cellulitis), secondary transmission of vaccine virus infection to close contacts, transverse myelitis and Guillain Barre syndrome (brain disorders) and herpes zoster (shingles). There have been documented cases of transmission of vaccine virus from a vaccinated child to household contacts, including a pregnant woman. A study in 2002 confirmed that adults exposed to natural chickenpox disease were protected from developing shingles and that there is concern that mass vaccination against chickenpox may cause a future epidemic of shingles, affecting more than 50 percent of Americans aged 10 to 44 years.\nShould Chickenpox Vaccine Be Mandated?\nNo. The majority of children who recover from chickenpox disease do not suffer complications and they are left with lifelong immunity to the disease. The chickenpox vaccine only gives temporary immunity and leaves children vulnerable to disease later in life when complications from chickenpox can be much more serious. Vaccine reaction reports suggest that the vaccine is more reactive than it was thought to be before licensure and there are too many outstanding questions about the true adverse event profile of this live virus vaccine. Parents should have a choice about whether or not to vaccinate their children with the chickenpox vaccine.\n","137":"In 2015, the National Vaccine Information Center continued a national vaccine education billboard and ad campaign launched in 2013 to advocate for vaccine risk awareness and the right to exercise voluntary, informed consent to vaccination.\nNVIC's \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No Forced Vaccination\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd message is currently being displayed in Times  Square on the 48 by 60 foot digital screen at 1500 Broadway and W. 43rd  Street; in Philadelphia on the Pennsylvania Turnpike bridge leading  west toward Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and also on  southbound I-95; and in New Jersey on both \u00c2\u00a0the high traffic East  Brunswick I-95 exit northbound to New York City, as well as on Rt. 22  west approaching the headquarters of Merck & Co.

Ironically, it's the vaccinated children who are the prime \"carriers\" or \"shedders\" of live viruses that they've been injected with recently, so who should we really avoid?\nIt is a scientific fact that any person injected with a live virus, even if it's weakened or \"inactive\" due to toxic formaldehyde, can shed that virus via saliva or mucus to any person whether they are inoculated or not. This is even true when the inoculated \"shedder\" doesn't come down with the disease or those particular strains of influenza themselves. When you also consider the fact that injecting mercury (thimerosal), aluminum, MSG and formaldehyde weakens the immune system by unnaturally shocking it into \"fight or flight\" mode, it turns out that the vaccinated children are even more vulnerable to their vaccinated counterparts who are carrying around and shedding the live viruses with which they themselves were injected.\nTo make matters worse, the vaccine manufacturers are immune to vaccine violence damage control because they have their own court of law with their own judges, who are paid shills of the industry. They also have a slush fund to keep the parents quiet whose children are suffering from autism spectrum disorder, brain damage, central nervous system damage and other chemical violence outcomes from the typical CDC nightmarish vaccine schedule. In other words, if every child stayed home from school for two weeks after each live virus inoculation, they would miss so much school that they could never graduate any grade, according to the CDC recommended vaccine schedule that is currently in place.\nThe CDC counts on the public NOT reading, synthesizing and utilizing the information they publish on their website, and most Americans have no clue that the most critical information is not on television or in the newspapers. On page 5 of the 14-page PDF on the CDC website, the public is warned:\nFecal shedding of vaccine virus was evaluated in a subset of persons enrolled in the phase III trials. Vaccine virus was shed by 9% of 360 infants after dose 1, but none of 249 and 385 infants after doses 2 and 3, respectively. Shedding was observed as early as 1 day and as late as 15 days after a dose. The potential for transmission of vaccine virus was not assessed in trials. In a post-licensure evaluation in the United States, stool samples were collected from infants for 9 days following the first dose. Rotavirus antigen was detected in stool of 21% of 103 infants, as early as day 3 post vaccination and as late as day 9.\nLet's just repeat that to ourselves one time: shedding was observed as early as one day and as late as 15 days after a dose, and the potential for transmission of the vaccine virus was not assessed in trials.\nThe year is 1955 and the Polio virus inoculation is declared \"safe, potent and efficient\" and released as the new \"miracle vaccine of the century\" all over the world. Immediately following the proclaimed prevention medicine for Polio, the Foundation for Infantile Paralysis ran press releases in all forms of available media that Dr. Jonas Salk invented and tested this miracle drug.\nThe foundation called for the manufacture of enough vaccines to inoculate more than nine million children and pregnant women. American Press and Radio declared victory for Salk and the \"greatest medical discovery of the century.\" Then came disastrous news: inoculated children began contracting polio. More and more cases were being reported by the day, including satellite cases where parents and siblings of inoculated children were contracting the disease, even when the inoculated child was not suffering. This was the \"carrier\" and \"shedding\" effect that science would later discover happens with measles, mumps and polio. The vaccinated children became the new carriers, and Western Medicine would blame anything else in the name of saving Big Pharma and the new reign of invasive, carcinogenic, immune-compromising and neurologically-impairing medicine.\nVaccinated Americans are therefore incurring weakened immunity from the toxins in today's vaccines and are more susceptible to catching live viruses from the shedders, \"the herd\" with which they surround themselves, at schools and at work. \"Herd immunity\" is a hoax and always has been. This is a public service message.\n","141":" (NaturalNews) The Disneyland measles outbreak has America in a panic -- a fact that's totally out of proportion to reality given that so far only 644 people have even caught the measles across the country during the entire year of 2014 vs. the 100,000+ Americans who die every year from the side effects of prescription medications. (The Disneyland outbreak, at least count, was just 39 people.)\nNevertheless, lots of parents are asking the question, \"Should I get my children vaccinated against the measles?\" I'm going to try to give you the most rational answer here regardless of whether you're pro-vaccine or opposed to vaccines on principle. But first, realize that the one-dimensional advice from the conventional media and health authorities is stupidly incomplete: \"Everybody get vaccinated!\"\nCan measles vaccines work to protect against measles? Absolutely they can in some people, but they are not without their own risks as you'll see below. Despite the way I have been deliberately mis-characterized by others, I am not opposed to the theory of immunization. In fact, I'm the author of \"A Blueprint for Safer Vaccines\" which argues for the creation of clean vaccines formulated without toxic ingredients used today such as mercury, MSG, aluminum and formaldehyde, all of which the CDC openly admits are still used in vaccines today.\nThe vaccine industry (along with the mainstream media) dishonestly positions vaccines as offering 100% protection with 0% risk. That's a lie. My job is to help you navigate the health propaganda so that you can make an informed decision about the possible risks vs. possible benefits.\nThe most important thing you can do when considering any vaccine is READ THE VACCINE INSERT!\nYou'd be astonished to learn what's printed on the vaccine insert because it's totally different from what the media tells you about vaccines. Never allow your children to be injected with a vaccine without requesting the vaccine insert which must be provided to patients by law. (Bring a magnifying glass, because the insert is written in very small text, probably to make it unreadable.)\nI collect vaccine inserts in an effort to document the history of medicine, and although I don't yet have a measles vaccine insert, I do have one for a very popular and widely-used chickenpox vaccine.\nTake a look at what you'll find in the Varivax chickenpox vaccine insert so that you can look for similar things on a measles vaccine insert:\nMost vaccine inserts have a tear-away portion to be handed to a patient. Of course, there's only one tear-away portion even though most vaccine come in vials that contain 10 doses. Obviously, you can't hand out the same tear-away sheet to 10 people, which is part of the reason why nearly everyone who gets a vaccine never sees the vaccine insert in advance:\nIf anybody in the media ever uttered this, they would be immediately labeled an \"anti-vaxxer!\" But the Varivax vaccine insert openly states it doesn't protect everybody from chickenpox. It also admits the vaccine doesn't treat the infection once you already have it:\nWhere's the science behind the vaccine? In nearly microscopic small text, this vaccine insert admits, \"No placebo-controlled study was carried out with VARIVAX using the current vaccine.\"\nHere's something the mainstream media never tells you and most vaccine pushers will NEVER admit: The chickenpox vaccine can cause the spread of chickenpox. It's admitted right in the insert:\nThe next block of microscopic text in the vaccine insert warns that the vaccine should never be given to pregnant women. Is this vaccine still given to pregnant women anyway? Of course it is. In fact, vaccine pushers are now targeting pregnant women for all sorts of vaccines which can cause spontaneous abortions:\nEvery vaccine insert must list the adverse effects (negative side effects) which have been reported in clinical trials following vaccination.\nFor this Varivax insert, some of the adverse effects listed right in the insert include:\n...nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Bell's palsy, non-febrile seizures, paresthesia and many more.\nEven though these are printed right in the vaccine insert, any person who dares mention these adverse effects publicly is aggressively condemned as being \"anti-science.\" Yet the science irrefutably documents the fact that vaccines cause these things. The science, in other words, has already established that vaccines can cause severe neurological disorders:\nThe next warning on VARIVAX comes from an admission that if the vaccine is given to people who have weak immune systems, it may cause them serious disease:\nIn many vaccine inserts, you'll find a warning that admits a person who receives the vaccine can then go on to spread the disease they were just vaccinated against.\nThe vaccine itself, in other words, can sometimes spread the disease. As printed in the VARIVAX insert:\n\"Post-marketing experience suggests that transmission of vaccine virus may occur rarely between healthy individuals who develop a varicella-like rash and healthy susceptible contacts.\"\nThis is an admission that the chickenpox vaccine can infect a person with chickenpox who can then spread it to someone else:\nMany vaccines are made with monosodium glutamate, the excitotoxin taste-enhancing chemical that destroys brain cells. It's also common to find vaccines formulated with mercury and aluminum.\nFor example, this Varivax insert openly states the vaccine is manufactured with:\nsucrose, hydrolyzed gelatin, sodium chloride, monosodium glutamate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, potassium chloride, neomycin (an antibiotic), EDTA and fetal bovine serum.\nHere's a warning not to take aspirin after being vaccinated, along with yet another warning that taking the vaccine can cause you to spread chickenpox to someone else.\nIt states, in plain black and white: \"It is rare, but possible, that once you have the vaccine, you could spread the chickenpox virus to others.\"\nAnd this portion of the vaccine insert admits the chickenpox vaccine can give you shingles:\nAdditional side effects are disclosed here, and they include:\nsevere skin disorders, swelling of the brain, seizures, inflammation of the lungs... and so on.\nFinally, here's another listing of the ingredients in the vaccine:\nAs you can see from the insert photos shown above, vaccines say all sorts of fascinating things on their legally required insert sheets that the media won't dare tell you.\nIn fact, vaccine pushers hope you never read the insert because they want to keep you in the dark about the side effects and toxic ingredients used in vaccines.\nThey also want you to be completely unaware that many vaccines can actually spread the disease they claim to prevent. Many measles outbreaks, it turns out, occur largely among children who were vaccinated against measles.\nThese are the truths about vaccines they don't want you to know. Rather than have the public be informed, they prefer to slap you in the face with twisted claims of \"SCIENCE!\" combined with the condemnation, intimidation and censorship of anyone who actually tries to point out what the vaccine insert says in black and white. Yes, reading the vaccine insert in public is enough to have you condemned by the vaccine pushers, even though what you are reading is documented by the vaccine manufacturer itself.\nTruly, the vaccine industry today is so corrupt and dangerous that it goes to great lengths to make sure no one reads the information on the insert. Just like the biotech industry, the vaccine industry goes to great lengths to make sure consumers have no idea what they are being injected with or swallowing.\nSo if you're thinking about getting your child vaccinated against measles because of the Disneyland scare, I encourage you to bring a magnifying glass and go visit a pharmacy or doctor and ask for the measles vaccine insert. If you read it and you're perfectly happy with all the ingredients, side effects and risks associated with that vaccine, then make whatever choice you want, knowing that you've at least conducted some due diligence rather than just blindly injecting your child with toxic chemicals the same way all the obedient sheeple do.\nPersonally, I think injecting children with MSG, formaldehyde, mercury and aluminum is nothing more than medical child abuse. And it turns out many millions of people in America agree with that assessment. In fact, until the vaccine industry cleans up its act and removes the toxic ingredients from its vaccines, vaccine \"compliance\" will never be very high among the informed. \nAbout the author:Mike Adams (aka the \"Health Ranger\") is a best selling author (#1 best selling science book on Amazon.com) and a globally recognized scientific researcher in clean foods.

This means that any child who was recently given an MMR vaccine is a walking disease-spreader, a truth that the media is refusing to report as even just a possibility in this case.\nThe fact that vaccinated individuals can and do carry around contagious measles for many weeks while displaying no symptoms of the disease suggests that this latest outbreak might just be another example of a vaccine-strain outbreak. While a handful of the roughly 100 measles cases identified so far have tested out as wild genotype B3 measles, according to the latest reports, the original source of the outbreak has yet to be identified.\n\"Numerous scientific studies indicate that children who receive a live virus vaccination can shed the disease and infect others for weeks or even months afterwards,\" said Leslie Manookian, a documentary filmmaker and activist. \"Thus, parents who vaccinate their children can indeed put others at risk.\"\nA fairly recent example of this occurred in New York City during a measles outbreak that was documented in 2011. A twice-vaccinated individual -- that is, an individual who received two separate doses of MMR in accordance with U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations -- was found to have spread measles to multiple individuals.\nNearly two decades ago, the CDC itself came to this same disturbing conclusion in a study published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology. Urine samples collected from newly vaccinated 15-month-old children as well as young adults revealed that nearly all of them had detectable levels of the measles virus inside their bodies, meaning they are the real contagion threat.\n\"In some cases, measles virus RNA was detected as early as 1 day or as late as 14 days after the children were vaccinated,\" explains the study about the unpredictability of the vaccine-transmitted virus.\n There's still so much that's unknown about the current outbreak, including where and how it actually started, that it's painfully obvious the media has a sinister agenda. The unvaccinated are the easiest scapegoats, because they're a minority (and they contradict the official story), so they're the ones being tagged as the instigators in supposedly \"bringing back\" this disease.\nMeasles has been around forever, even since the MMR vaccine was introduced, and outbreaks are quite common among both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. In many cases, those who succumb to the disease are those who were already vaccinated, developing the condition either from the vaccine itself or from others who received the vaccine. A 2014 report published by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) has this to say about who the real instigators of disease outbreaks typically are.\nAccording to GlobalResearch.org, the report openly states \"that the most highly vaccinated populations are also those with the greatest number of outbreaks for those same infectious diseases. This was especially the case for measles, mumps, rubella, polio and pertussis outbreaks.\"\nOh, but vaccines only work when most everyone is vaccinated because of a magical concept known as \"herd immunity,\" right? Not so fast. The Office of Medical and Scientific Justice (OMSJ), having thoroughly analyzed the conclusions presented in the CFR report, determined that even the CFR isn't convinced that herd immunity is a scientifically legitimate concept.\nAccording to Global Research, the OMSJ concluded that given \"the repeated incidences of infectious outbreaks in populations with 94% or more vaccine compliance [the alleged threshold when herd immunity is activated], and the emergence of new viral strains, the concept of herd immunity should be forgotten.\n\"The Office offers several possibilities to explain the report: 1) vaccines are increasingly becoming ineffective and causing 'immune dysfunction,' and 2) 'vaccine antigen responses' may be reprogramming viruses while weakening the immune systems of the most vaccinated individuals.\"\nDon't expect to hear any of this from propaganda outlets like CNN, Fox and USA Today, which are preying on the weak-minded in order to advance the sentiment that unvaccinated people are a threat -- or worse, a societal scourge. If anything, the exact opposite is true when considering published science, which shows that vaccinated people are the biggest threats.\n\"Health officials should require a two-week quarantine of all children and adults who receive vaccinations,\" contends Sally Fallon Morell, president of the Weston A. Price Foundation (WAPF). \"This is the minimum amount of time required to prevent transmission of infectious diseases to the rest of the population, including individuals who have been previously vaccinated.\"\nSources for this article include:\nA coordinated censorship attack is being waged against the entire independent media by Google, YouTube and Facebook.

But the data points presented in the study reveal that the vast majority of those who caught measles had previously been vaccinated, and yet the outbreak is still somehow being blamed 100% on the unvaccinated.\nAccording to information from the study presented by California Healthline, as many as 86% of those who caught measles at Disneyland were fully up to date on their MMR vaccinations for measles, mumps and rubella. This means that none of them should have gotten measles, if you believe the official story anyway.\nBut in the fantasy reality of so-called \"herd immunity,\" 86% just isn't enough to prevent a disease outbreak, or so goes the myth. In order for full protection to be gained, claims the establishment, a 95% vaccination rate is required for vaccines that are 100% effective -- though these numbers often shift between 90% and 99%, or are omitted entirely, depending on the agenda of a particular media report.\n Ah yes, the infamous herd immunity scapegoat. It's just too convenient for vax-pimping scientists to claim that their precious vaccines don't work because not enough people are getting them. It couldn't be that these vaccines simply don't work at all, as clearly demonstrated by the fact that most of the people affected during disease outbreaks were jabbed in accordance with government guidelines.\nNo, it must be all those crazy anti-vaxxers spreading measles, even though the unvaccinated typically don't contract measles during outbreaks (and thus don't spread it, since they don't actually have it). In this case, only a very small percentage of those affected hadn't been vaccinated, so to surmise that they somehow triggered the outbreak is an absurd stretch.\nMore than likely, it was a vaccinated individual who triggered the outbreak as a result of live attenuated viral vaccines (LAV) like MMR, which are known to shed vaccine-type viruses following vaccine administration.\n\"The public health community is blaming unvaccinated children for the outbreak of measles at Disneyland, but the illnesses could just as easily have occurred due to contact with a recently vaccinated individual,\" said Sally Fallon Morell, president of the Weston A. Price Foundation (WAPF).\n Though it would be loathe to admit it, the vaccine mafia is clearly losing major ground in its failing war on natural immunity. No matter how these charlatans try to spin the issue, vaccines don't work if people who get them are still contracting disease, supposedly because other people around them aren't getting vaccinated.\n\"At best, vaccines boost our defenses only temporarily,\" explained Shane Ellison from The People's Chemist. \"That's because your immune system is programmed to recognize and attack invaders that come through the biological 'front door.' That would be your nose, mouth and eyes. It doesn't work properly when we shove infection into our body with a needle.\"\nA coordinated censorship attack is being waged against the entire independent media by Google, YouTube and Facebook.

They tested positive for the HCG antigen,\" Dr. Muhame Ngare of the Mercy Medical Centre in Nairobi told LifeSiteNews. \"They were all laced with HCG.\"\nHCG is a chemical developed by the World Health Organization for sterilization purposes. When injected into the body of a young woman, it causes a pregnancy to be destroyed by the body's own antibody response to the HCG, resulting in a spontaneous abortion. Its effectiveness lasts for years, causing abortions in women up to three years after the injections.\nDr. Ngare explained \"...this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine.\"\nThe Kenyan government, of course, insists the vaccine is perfectly safe. Dr. Tabu of Kenya's Health Ministry even told the media that because some young women are still having babies, the vaccine therefore must not contain any sterilization agent. However, this claim belies the fact that HCG doesn't work 100% of the time. It only sterilizes the majority of those injected with it, not all of them.\nMore importantly, the Kenyan Catholic Church is a pro-vaccine organization. \"What reason do the Catholic doctors have for lying?\" asked Dr. Ngare as reported in the LifeSiteNews article linked above. \"The Catholic Church has been here in Kenya providing health care and vaccinating for 100 years for longer than Kenya has existed as a country.\"\nIn other words, the very group exposing the sterilization agenda of the tetanus vaccines is in fact a pro-vaccination group. Yet even they have now come to realize the horrifying truth: vaccines are the perfect vector for governments to deviously insert covert chemical or viral agents which are never revealed to the public.\nWhat really raised red flags about this so-called tetanus vaccine was the highly unusual inoculation schedule. This vaccine demanded five shots over two years -- a schedule that isn't used for tetanus.\n\"The only time tetanus vaccine has been given in five doses is when it is used as a carrier in fertility regulating vaccines laced with the pregnancy hormone, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) developed by WHO in 1992.\" explained Dr. Ngare.\nFurthermore, the vaccine was only being given to women of child-bearing years, not men or women beyond the age of fertility.\nAs Dr. Ngare explains, the same vaccine sterilization campaign was used in 1993 in Mexico and both Nicaragua and the Philippines in 1994. WHO attempted to bring it to Kenya in the 1990's, Ngare says, but the effort was stopped by the Catholic Church.\nAccording to Brian Clowes of Human Life International, the United Nations is not refuting the laboratory testing and confirmation of HCG in the vaccines. Instead, it claims some vaccines were \"contaminated\" in the manufacturing process -- an absurd claim that no reasonable person would believe because HCG should never even be anywhere near a vaccine manufacturing operation unless someone put it there deliberately.\nLifeSiteNews reports that it:\nhas obtained a UN report on an August 1992 meeting at its world headquarters in Geneva of 10 scientists from \"Australia, Europe, India and the U.S.A\" and 10 \"women's health advocates\" from around the world, to discuss the use of \"fertility regulating vaccines.\" It describes the \"anti-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin vaccine\" as the most advanced.\nRead the full report from LifeSiteNews at:\nhttp:\/\/www.lifesitenews.com\/news\/a-mass-ster... \nYou will not see this news reported by any mainstream media outlet in the United States. All truth about vaccines is censored, even if the truth is that the United Nations is deliberately engaged in a campaign of vaccine genocide against people of Africa.\nWhat is happening in Kenya is a crime against humanity, and it is a crime committed with deliberate racial discrimination. Normally, the liberal media in the United States would be all over a story involving racial discrimination and genocide -- or even a single police shooting of a black teenager -- but because this genocide is being committed with vaccines, the entire mainstream media excuses it. Apparently, medical crimes against black people are perfectly acceptable to the liberal media as long as vaccines are used as the weapon.\nAs this story clearly demonstrates, \"vaccine violence\" is very real in our world. Vaccines are the perfect weapon for population control for several reasons:\n1) Nobody really knows what's in them.\n2) They can be easily spiked with hidden chemicals.\n3) They can be administered under the cover of \"public health.\"\n4) All governments and establishment media will deliberately collaborate with the genocide in order to protect vaccines from being recognized as medical weapons against women.\nThus, vaccines can be routinely used to inject populations with birth control chemicals or even stealth cancer viruses. In fact, this is exactly what happened to as many as 98 million Americans during the mass polio vaccinations of the 1960's and 70's. The CDC even documented the \"accidental\" injection of millions of Americans with the cancer-causing SV40 simian virus, but the agency scrubbed all that history from its website in 2013.\nIn Kenya today, government authorities also claim the sterilization chemical was an \"accidental\" contamination. That's the excuse that can always be used as a cover story in weaponized vaccination schemes, where governments deliberately taint vaccines with known chemicals that end life, promote cancer or cause spontaneous abortions.\nThe deliberate adding of HCG to vaccines without full disclosure to the population is a heinous violation of human rights and human dignity. Here are just a few of the crimes now being committed against humanity under the guise of vaccinations:\nCRIME #1) No informed consent. None of these women in Kenya were told the truth that they were being injected with a sterilization chemical designed to cause infertility.\nCRIME #2) Race-based genocide. The targeting of Kenyan women with this vaccine is a deliberate selection based on their race. By any reasonable standard, this would be called a racially-motivated hate crime resulting in genocide.\nCRIME #3) The deliberate killing of a human being. The spontaneous abortions caused by these HCG-spiked vaccines results in the ending of a human life inside the mother's body. These killings take place without the consent or permission of the mother, nor any opportunity for defense of the life of the unborn child.\nCRIME #4) Violation of Geneva Convention limitations on medical experimentation. All these Kenyan women injected with this vaccine are being used as human guinea pigs in a covert, criminal medical experiment. None of these women voluntarily signed up for this medical experiment, nor were they even informed. This is a medical crime against human beings.\nCRIME #5) Crimes against women. Only women were selected for this targeted sterilization vaccine effort, proving that this is not only a race-based crime but also a gender-based crime against women.\nIf you add all this up, you've got weaponized vaccines being intentionally spiked with a known sterilization chemical developed by the WHO, then deployed in a racially-motivated genocidal manner that targets women to be used in an illegal medical experiment administered via vaccine inoculations.\nYet, despite all this, the mainstream media is perfectly okay with this activity. The World Health Organizations endorses it. The United Nations organizes it. Governments help fund it. Vaccine-pushing scientists excuse it. Media outlets cover it up and censor the story, hoping you don't read Natural News or Life Site News to learn the truth.\nWhen pharmacies in your neighborhood push flu shots and other vaccines, they don't tell you they are part of a branch of medicine steeped in genocide, racially-motivated hate crimes and a medical war on women. They don't tell you that flu shots still contain toxic mercury at concentrations 100 times the mercury found in ocean fish. They don't tell you anything about what's in those vaccines for the same reason that women in Kenya are never told what's in them, either.\nThe truth is that vaccines are easily deployed as weapons against humanity under the false cover story that they are saving humanity. What better way to pursue deliberate chemically-induced population control than to convince people they are being injected \"for their own good?\"\nThis is precisely why Bill Gates famously said:\nThe world today has 6.8 billion people... that's headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.\nWhy would Bill Gates be talking about vaccines REDUCING human population if vaccines didn't secretly contain sterilization agents? Remember, Gates is the same person who has funded all sorts of sterilization technologies including one that blasts men's scrotums with high-intensity sound waves to make them infertile.\nGates is part of a covert medical cabal that believes aggressive human depopulation is urgently necessary to save the planet. This group, which includes many scientists and virologists, believe that the most effective tools for human depopulation are:\n1) Vaccines which are covertly spiked with sterilization chemicals.\n2) Genetically engineered viruses with a high mortality rate, possibly engineered to target specific races and genetic profiles.\nFor example, Dr. Charles Arntzen, head of The Biodesign Institute for Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology recently joked about using an engineered virus to cull the human population, saying \"That's the answer! Go out and use genetic engineering to create a better virus. (laughter) Twenty-five percent of the population is supposed to go in Contagion.\"\nAs I wrote on October 22, 2014, many virologists believe humans are nothing more than a \"parasite\" to be consumed by viruses which are the planet's \"immune response\" to human overpopulation. Here's a passage from the book \"The Hot Zone\" by Richard Preston, summarizing the way these scientists think:\n...the earth is mounting an immune response against the human species. It is beginning to react to the human parasite, the flooding infection of people, the dead spots of concrete all over the planet, the cancerous rot-outs in Europe, Japan and the United States, thick with replicating primates [i.e. humans], the colonies enlarging and spreading and threatening to shock the biosphere with mass extinctions.\nPerhaps the biosphere does not \"like\" the idea of five billion humans. Or it could also be said that the extreme amplification of the human race, which has occurred only in the past hundred years or so, has suddenly produced a very large quantity of meat, which is sitting everywhere in the biosphere and may not be able to defend itself against a life form that might want to consume it...\nThe earth's immune system, so to speak, has recognized the presence of the human species and is starting to kick in. The earth is attempting to rid itself of an infection by the human parasite.\nWhat's extraordinary in all this -- both with vaccines and viruses engineered as weapons -- is how the most influential people in the scientific community have come to view humanity as an enemy to be destroyed via tools of medicine and science. Frighteningly, modern medical science has the tools to carry out its genocidal assaults on humankind through \"accidental\" releases of deadly viruses or \"accidental\" contamination of vaccines with sterilization chemicals.\nThe evidence of deliberate sterilization chemicals in United Nations vaccines raises the obvious question: Was the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa also intentional? And what else might scientists, vaccine pushers, world health authorities and governments have in mind for human depopulation in the years ahead?\nIs there already something in the food supply that causes sterilization? The answer is a definite YES, and just like the pandemic viruses, it too is genetically engineered.\nThese are the vectors for the science-based genocidal assault on humanity:\n1) Vaccines\n2) Viruses\n3) Food\n4) Water\n5) Chemtrails (i.e. atmospheric deployment of chemicals)\nAll five of these vectors present \"opportunities\" for genocidal scientists to achieve their goal of human sterilization and depopulation. That is precisely why anyone who wishes to survive the great human culling now under way must take extraordinary steps to isolate themselves from institutionally-produced food, water and medicine. The only safe food, water and medicine is that which was produced independently and far outside the control of Big Food, Big Ag and Big Pharma.\nDon't drink the city water without filtering it first, and read my laboratory testing results for all popular water filters at www.WaterFilterLabs.com \nDon't eat factory-produced food. Don't allow yourself to be injected with weaponized vaccines. Don't take Big Pharma's deadly medicines. Be smart by being skeptical about the claimed \"safety\" of all those things created by institutions and authorities that quite literally want to kill off a significant percentage of the existing world population.\nIf you're smart and resourceful, you might just survive this great human culling. On the other hand, those who anxiously line up to be injected with the seasonal flu shots are all admitting they are too stupid and gullible to last long in a world where \"science\" has declared a covert war on human life.\nSources for this article include:\n[1] http:\/\/www.lifesitenews.com\/news\/a-mass-ster... \n[2] http:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/041345_cdc_polio_... \n[3] http:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/047358_ebola_outb... \n[4] http:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/029911_vaccines_b... \n[5] http:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/046347_ebola_vacc... \nAbout the author:Mike Adams (aka the \"Health Ranger\") is a best selling author (#1 best selling science book on Amazon.com) and a globally recognized scientific researcher in clean foods.

Nor am I opposed to science. What I am opposed to is fraudulent science, and that's what this article is all about.\nMeasles and mumps are making a huge comeback in the United States, but doctors and journalists all make the same critical error in understanding why. They blame \"parents who don't vaccinate their kids\" as the cause, but the real cause -- as revealed by whistleblowing scientists working for top vaccine manufacturers -- is that measles and mumps vaccines are designed to fail from the start.\nScientific fraud, it turns out, is an inherent part of the vaccine industry.\nHow do we know? Because whistleblowers who worked in the industry have found the courage to speak out and tell the truth. These people are the Edward Snowdens of the vaccine industry.\nMerck knowingly falsified its mumps vaccine test results to fabricate a \"95% efficacy rate\" say former Merck virologists Stephen Krahling and Joan Wlochowski in their shocking False Claims Act document.\nAs I wrote last year, \" In order to do this, Merck spiked the blood test with animal antibodies in order to artificially inflate the appearance of immune system antibodies.\"\nFrom the False Claims Act complaint:\nMerck also added animal antibodies to blood samples to achieve more favorable test results, though it knew that the human immune system would never produce such antibodies, and that the antibodies created a laboratory testing scenario that \"did not in any way correspond to, correlate with, or represent real life ... virus neutralization in vaccinated people,\" according to the complaint.\nMerck, of course, denies the claims, just like all the drug companies deny ever engaging in bribery, or using children for medical experiments, or ghostwriting \"scientific\" studies that get published in science journals, or conspiring to suppress competing generic drugs and so on. Yet, as history has shown, all the top drug companies are routinely engaged in widespread criminal behavior, including conspiracy, fraud, bribery and more.\nStephen Krahling and Joan Wlochowski are simply telling us what we already suspected: that Merck falsifies the efficacy of their vaccines in order to make them appear to be working when they actually aren't. Why would a drug company do such a thing? Consider the fact that Merck has both motive and opportunity.\nThe vaccination dogma is so deeply embedded in the minds of doctors, journalists and the public, that any time a communicable disease starts to spread, everybody immediately leaps to the false conclusion that \"more vaccines are needed.\" This is very nearly a Pavlovian reaction in the minds of the brainwashed masses. \"Spread of disease = lack of vaccines.\"\nThus, the spread of disease actually boosts vaccine sales. Epidemics are a \"marketing tool\" to create demand for a profitable product that people can be convinced to purchase over and over again, year after year, whether it works or not.\nAnd how do you create that demand? You engineer an epidemic by making sure your own vaccine products don't work. Fear drives people to get vaccinated, so fear is used as the primary marketing tool.\nBut why hasn't the con been exposed yet? Why haven't scientists announced that most of the children afflicted with measles and mumps are the very same children who were vaccinated? One study showed that 97 percent of children afflicted with mumps had already been vaccinated against mumps.\nIn 2010, a mumps outbreak spread in New Jersey, and 77 percent of children afflicted with mumps had already been vaccinated against mumps.\nThe same is true with measles. Most measles outbreaks spread among those who have been vaccinated against measles.\nWhen a swine flu outbreak swept through Britain in 2010, it turns out that 70 percent of those infected had already been vaccinated against swine flu.\nFar from protecting people from disease outbreaks, vaccines often promote the pandemic they claim to prevent.\nWhy does the industry keep getting away with this fraud? The answer is because nobody ever compares infection rates of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people. They all just ASSUME vaccines work because that is the dogma of modern medicine. Assumption becomes \"fact\" in the minds of brainwashed medical experts.\nThis is one of the tenants of the fraud-based medical system: Vaccines are assumed to work 100% of the time, without exception, and anyone who questions this is immediately branded a heretic. There is no tolerance whatsoever for any critical thinking or scientific inquiry when it comes to vaccines. And God forbid if you bring up the issue of mercury in vaccines, as the vaccine industry apparently believes that mercury magically becomes non-toxic when used in vaccines and injected into the body.\nThus, vaccines that fail (due to low efficacy) are never detected or even questioned. The fraud continues right under our noses. So a vaccine company can easily put a mumps or measles vaccine into circulation that is designed to fail while actually weakening the immune system from the mercury, formaldehyde, MSG and aluminum that are still used in vaccines today.\nThis actually causes an increase in the spread of these diseases, resulting in more alarmist media stories about the \"spread of measles and mumps\" which then results in more parents rushing to CVS pharmacies to get their children injected with yet another useless vaccine.\nHow's that for an insidious profit model?\nBut it's even worse than that. While some vaccines are simply designed to fail, other vaccines are designed to cause outbreaks of disease.\nAs Natural News previously exposed, the vaccine industry was caught shipping live viruses to vaccine manufacturers of flu vaccines in 18 countries.\nThis was done by none other than Baxter International, Inc. one of the top suppliers of \"weakened\" flu virus material for use in vaccines. Except in this case, they weren't weakened. Vaccines made with this material simply gave people the flu!\nIn the realm of desktop computing, many people believe that anti-virus companies write and release viruses in order to cause fear and boost demand for their products. It's an incredibly effective way to sell more products. All you have to do is pay a group of hackers a couple of million dollars to keep writing viruses that get covered in the mainstream media. The scarier the story, the more people buy anti-virus software. I happen to know firsthand that McAfee uses dishonest scare tactics to sell their security software services, claiming your website is infected when it actually isn't.\nVaccine companies, it turns out, use the same tactic. From time to time, they allow live viruses into the flu shots, thereby spreading influenza and causing the very kind of fear and panic that drives people into pharmacies to buy more vaccines.\nThe WHO and CDC are all part of it too, stirring up irrational fear and panic like they did with the H5N1 virus a few years ago. It turns out that WHO panel members receive kickbacks from drug companies to engineer these anti-science scare stories.\nDuring the swine flu pandemic, it was revealed that 5 of the 15 members of a WHO advisory panel had financial ties to the very same drug companies who would financially benefit from the pandemic. That's called \"conflict of interest\" in any other industry, yet for some reason it is fully tolerated in the fraudulent vaccine industry.\nIn 2010, an outstanding article by Dr. Gary Null explained much of this in excruciating detail. Read that article here on Natural News.\nThe deeper you dig into the vaccine industry and its longstanding practice of scientific fraud, misrepresentation, fear mongering and \"medical false flags,\" the more you realize just what a total con the vaccine industry has become.\nRead more:\nhttp:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/029124_flu_vaccin... \nhttp:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/036328_Merck_mump... \nClick here for an example of the mainstream media blindly blaming a lack of vaccines for the recent rise in measles and mumps.\nClick here to read the full False Claims Act filed by former Merck virologists. \nAbout the author:Mike Adams (aka the \"Health Ranger\") is a best selling author (#1 best selling science book on Amazon.com) and a globally recognized scientific researcher in clean foods.

He has never been persuaded by spurious claims that vaccines are toxic to children and responsible for autism or a host of other ailments. But tragically, Salamone found out first-hand that vaccines do have real, rare side effects when he saw his infant son, David, become weak and unable to crawl shortly after receiving the oral polio vaccine in 1990. After about two years of physical therapy and doctors' visits, Salamone learned that owing to a weakened immune system, David had contracted polio from the vaccine. \"We basically gave him polio that day,\" says Salamone, who has retired from a position as a non-profit executive, and lives in Mount Holly, Virginia.\nThat was a known risk of the vaccination, which causes roughly one case of the disease per 2.4 million doses, often in people with an immune deficiency. A safer, inactivated, polio vaccine was available at the time, but the oral vaccine was cheaper, easier to administer and thought to be more effective at controlling outbreaks. But by the 1980s, polio had been all but eliminated in the United States; all cases originating in the country came from the vaccine. Salamone and other parents successfully campaigned for the United States to shift to the safer version in the late 1990s.\nVaccines face a tougher safety standard than most pharmaceutical products because they are given to healthy people, often children. What they stave off is unseen, and many of the diseases are now rare, with their effects forgotten. So only the risks of vaccines, low as they may be, loom in the public imagination. A backlash against vaccination, spurred by the likes of Andrew Wakefield \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a UK surgeon who was struck off the medical register after making unfounded claims about the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and a litany of celebrities and activists, has sometimes overshadowed scientific work to uncover real vaccine side effects. Many false links have been dispelled, including theories that the MMR vaccine and the vaccine preservative thimerosal cause autism1. But vaccines do carry risks, ranging from rashes or tenderness at the site of injection to fever-associated seizures called febrile convulsions and dangerous infections in those with compromised immune systems.\nSerious problems are rare, so it is hard to prove that a vaccine causes them. Studies to confirm or debunk vaccine-associated risks can take a long time and, in the meantime, public-health officials must make difficult decisions on what to do and how to communicate with the public. Still, such work is necessary to maintain public trust, says Neal Halsey, a paediatrician at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. \"If we don't do the research, there will be more people who don't believe in vaccines,\" he says. \n Victims of their own success\n Technological advances have made modern vaccines purer and safer than their historical counterparts. Most developed countries have switched to the inactivated polio vaccine and stopped using whole-cell pertussis (whooping cough) vaccines, which are made from killed bacteria and cause relatively high rates of arm swelling, febrile convulsions and periods of limpness or unresponsiveness.\nClick for larger image \nImproved safety means that researchers are sometimes searching for vanishingly small risks. Although vaccines must undergo stringent safety tests before distribution, the trials typically don't enrol enough people to catch risks on the order of one case per 10,000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c100,000 people (see 'Calculating risks'). The only way to find such side effects is to deploy the vaccine in the population and watch.\nOfficials have become increasingly vigilant. As worries about pandemic H1N1 influenza spread in 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10, several companies worked to prepare as many vaccine doses as possible. Meanwhile, health officials launched an unprecedented surveillance effort to monitor the vaccines' safety. US scientists and officials studied data from voluntary adverse-event reports, managed-care organizations, health-insurance companies, immunization registries, a network of neurologists and various health-care systems. European scientists linked data from 15 countries. And Chinese officials instructed health-care workers to report potential side effects within 24 hours; for the most serious events, they had two hours.\nScientists were specifically looking for Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome, a paralytic disorder that is often treatable but can cause long-term disability or death. A 1976 swine-flu vaccine distributed in the United States was associated with between five and nine cases per one million vaccine recipients. Studies of subsequent flu vaccines have not shown a consistent link, but officials have been on the lookout for it. During the 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 pandemic, something stranger turned up: some 60 cases of narcolepsy emerged among 4- to 19-year-olds in Finland. Most had received the H1N1 vaccine Pandemrix, made by GlaxoSmithKline in Brentford, UK. Another narcolepsy cluster showed up in Sweden. Scientists have yet to confirm whether the vaccine caused the rise in incidence.\nOnline collection  \nSurveillance efforts have paid off for a variety of vaccines. A rotavirus vaccine was suspended in the United States in 1999 after public-health officials received 15 reports of intussusception, an infolding of the bowel, in vaccinated infants. The mechanism is uncertain, but the live-virus vaccine might cause swelling of bowel lymph nodes and increase contraction, leading to infolding. The vaccine is estimated to have caused about one case of intussusception per 10,000 recipients.\nIn 2007, Nicola Klein, co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in Oakland, California, and her colleagues found that children aged between 12 and 23 months who had been immunized with a combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) had more febrile convulsions 7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 days after vaccination than those receiving separate MMR and varicella vaccines. The finding prompted a US immunization advisory committee to withdraw its preference for the MMRV vaccine. A subsequent study2 suggested that the combined vaccine resulted in one more febrile convulsion per 2,300 doses than the MMR and varicella vaccines given separately.\nEfforts are under way to improve surveillance in low- and middle-income countries, some of which are gaining increased access to vaccines through an international programme called the GAVI Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation), based in Geneva, Switzerland. These areas could soon see new vaccines for diseases such as dengue and cholera. In 2006, the Pan American Health Organization, based in Washington DC, started a surveillance network among five Latin American countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva is working with 12 countries, including Iran, Tunisia, Vietnam and India, to develop methods and tools for vaccine-safety monitoring, and half are already reporting to a global database, says Patrick Zuber, the WHO's group leader of global vaccine safety.\nResearchers have also started conducting larger clinical trials. Pre-licensure trials for two new rotavirus vaccines, RotaTeq by Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, and Rotarix by GlaxoSmithKline, each enrolled more than 60,000 infants to evaluate safety3 ,4. But even these large trials cannot rule out rare events, so efforts would be better spent on well planned surveillance after licensing, argues Rino Rappuoli, global head of vaccines research at Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics in Siena, Italy. With big pre-licensure trials, \"you may feel better as a regulator, but you're not answering the scientific question\", he says. Preliminary post-licensure studies in Mexico have detected a possible slight increase in intussusception risk after the first dose of Rotarix, and a similar pattern has emerged in Australia for both vaccines5. However, some researchers speculate that rotavirus vaccination may also protect against intussusception later. \n Delayed results, lost trust\n Even if a possible side effect is found, long periods of uncertainty can follow. To amass convincing evidence, scientists sometimes need to do controlled studies in multiple countries, covering hundreds of thousands or even millions of people. Scientists have not yet conclusively determined whether Pandemrix contributed to the European cluster of narcolepsy cases.\nScientists in the Vaccine Adverse Event Surveillance & Communication Consortium, a European research network, are examining narcolepsy diagnosis rates and comparing cases with matched controls across several European Union countries, some of which used different H1N1 vaccines. Data suggest that diagnosis rates rose slightly in several countries starting in 2008, before H1N1 vaccines were being distributed, but not enough to explain the episode in Finland, says principal investigator Miriam Sturkenboom, a pharmacoepidemiologist at Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam in the Netherlands. GlaxoSmithKline is also funding a study in Canada, where an H1N1 vaccine nearly identical to Pandemrix was used, but no rise in narcolepsy has been reported.\nThe increase in narcolepsy diagnoses might be explained by heightened disease awareness or infections with the H1N1 virus itself, says Jan Bonhoeffer, a paediatric-infectious-disease specialist at the University Children's Hospital Basel in Switzerland, and chief executive of the Brighton Collaboration, an international vaccine-safety research network. He says that the narcolepsy story fits a familiar pattern, similar to that seen with MMR and autism: people are eager to find an underlying cause for a serious, chronic, poorly understood disease.\nResearchers need to investigate possible safety issues quickly, Bonhoeffer adds. Otherwise, by the time scientists conclude that a concern is unfounded, \"no one cares, and it takes years to build up the trust again\", he says. \"So often, the widely communicated concern has caused more harm than it intended to prevent.\" A global vaccine-safety network would give scientists a faster way to test hypotheses with sufficient sample sizes, he says. In that spirit, the WHO is coordinating a global study on pandemic H1N1 flu vaccines and Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome.\nBut strictly controlled randomized trials \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the highest standard of evidence for determining causality \u00e2\u20ac\u201d are often not possible because of the large number of participants needed. And randomized trials in one location will not prevent some researchers questioning whether the results apply in others, says Alfred Berg, a clinical epidemiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.\nEven if surveillance efforts became faster and more thorough, public-health officials still need to make quick decisions with incomplete data. Authorities often err on the side of caution, but warnings can make the public wary. In March, for example, Japanese officials suspended a vaccine for pneumococcal illnesses and one for  Haemophilus influenzae  type b when four children died shortly after immunization. Officials later concluded that there was no direct evidence of a link, but the episode still caused a scare, says Pier Luigi Lopalco, head of the vaccine-preventable-diseases programme at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Solna, Sweden. Suspending a vaccine tends to get more media attention than resuming one, he says, so people remember only the threat.\nUS government officials have drawn criticism for pushing for removal of thimerosal from vaccines, despite a lack of evidence that it poses a risk. \"People said, why are you removing this if it's not a problem?\" says Ken Bromberg, a paediatrician at the Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York. \"It must really be a problem even though you say it's not.\" But inaction would have caused a loss of credibility, says Halsey. \"That is not something I think the public would have accepted.\" \n Finding those in danger\n Researchers have long known that some individuals are more susceptible to vaccine risks than others. Immunocompromised individuals have generally been discouraged from receiving live-virus vaccines. But other possible vulnerabilities are less clear. Some speculate that children with metabolic disorders might be prone to vaccine side effects, but two studies published in April suggest otherwise. Klein and her colleagues reported6 that children with inherited metabolic disorders do not show an increase in emergency-department visits or hospitalizations in the 30 days after being immunized. The other study found that children with one type of metabolic disorder \u00e2\u20ac\u201d urea cycle disorders \u00e2\u20ac\u201d did not have more serious metabolic problems than usual within 21 days of vaccination7.\nSome researchers hope that doctors will eventually be able to screen people for genetic predispositions to vaccine side effects. Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, says that once predispositions have been identified, genetic screening would at least make the risks and benefits explicit. Scientists have begun studying predispositions to side effects from smallpox vaccination: Kathryn Edwards, a vaccinologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and her colleagues have reported8 two genes that might be associated with reactions such as rashes, and Poland's team is searching for genetic risk factors for myopericarditis \u00e2\u20ac\u201d inflammation of the heart muscle and surrounding tissue.\nEven if immunization does prove risky for certain children, withholding the vaccine could pose a greater threat. Vaccine-preventable diseases can be particularly severe or even fatal for patients with metabolic disorders, says Marshall Summar, chief of the division of genetics and metabolism at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington DC.\nEdwards and her colleagues have been studying how children with mitochondrial disorders, a group of metabolic disorders, respond to vaccines and natural infections. If vaccines present a risk, doctors could take steps to counteract possible effects, for example by ensuring that the child is well nourished after immunization, says Edwards.\nSafer vaccines and manufacturing processes are also in the works. A Novartis plant in Holly Springs, North Carolina, will produce influenza vaccine doses in cell culture, rather than the industry-standard chicken eggs. This process will improve reliability and reduce allergic reactions to egg proteins, says Rappuoli. The plant will be ready to make pandemic-flu vaccine this year if needed, he says.\nResearchers are also developing replacements for vaccines that can be risky for vulnerable groups. These include current smallpox vaccines that cannot safely be given to immunocompromised people; the tuberculosis vaccine, which is not recommended for HIV-positive infants; and the yellow-fever vaccine, which puts elderly people at particular risk of a yellow-fever-like illness. The challenge will be to make safer vaccines just as effective: James Cherry, a paediatric-infectious-disease specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles, speculates that an outbreak of whooping cough in California in 2010 might have occurred partly because the safer acellular pertussis vaccines now in common use in developed countries tend to be less effective than the best whole-cell vaccines.\nResearchers are quick to emphasize that the benefits of vaccines still greatly outweigh the risks. But as diseases recede from the public's memory, the population's tolerance for side effects will drop even further. \"If you don't know the diseases and you haven't seen them, then you really aren't willing to accept any risk,\" says Edwards. Despite scientists' best efforts, eliminating risk is impossible. Vaccines are biological products with biological effects, says Juhani Eskola, deputy director general of Finland's National Institute for Health and Welfare in Helsinki. \"We can never make them 100% safe.\"\u00c2\u00a0\nRoberta Kwok is a freelance writer in Burlingame, California.\n","147":"Critics call Donald Trump unpredictable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who knows what he will do next?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has become a popular rhetorical question in US\u00c2\u00a0politics.

Kennedy says he would head the commission; he has in the past argued \u00e2\u20ac\u201d unconvincingly \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that a preservative in some childhood vaccines is linked to autism spectrum disorder, despite abundant evidence to the contrary.\nTrump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embrace of the tiresome and discredited anti-vaccination movement is no secret. He has tweeted and publicly discussed his concerns that childhood vaccines may be linked to autism. He has previously met with like-minded activists, including Andrew Wakefield, a father of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanti-vaxxer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 crusade who has been barred from practising medicine in the United Kingdom for professional misconduct.\nGiven the people Trump has chosen to listen to, his suggestion of a Kennedy-headed vaccine commission should be no surprise. But it remains difficult to grasp how someone in his position, with unlimited access to the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best resources on vaccine safety, would selectively choose to overlook them all: the studies, the commissions, the scientists who have spent a lifetime studying vaccines. What good is another investigation of speculation already so thoroughly analysed and debunked \u00e2\u20ac\u201d unless it is being set up to reach a different conclusion? It is a clear waste of money and effort. Much more frustratingly, it fuels an anti-vaccination movement that puts children and elderly people at risk.\nTrump surely knows that there is already a federal commission to evaluate vaccine safety. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that reports to the government on vaccine safety. Vaccines are also regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and often have particularly stringent safety requirements because they are used in healthy children.\nThere is already ample evidence that vaccines do not elevate the risk of autism. A 2015 study of more than 95,000 children found no association between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and an increased risk of autism \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even among children with a family history of the disorder (A. Jain et al. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 313, 1534\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1540; 2015). As for Kennedy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument about vaccine preservatives, the CDC has repeatedly tried \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and failed \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to find a link between that preservative, called thimerosal, and autism. In 2004, the US Institute of Medicine reported that a review of the literature had also found no such link (see go.nature.com\/2jwe4ba). And in the United States, the argument is now moot: thimerosal was removed from most childhood vaccines administered in the country, as a precautionary measure, beginning in 2001. Autism diagnoses continued unabated.\nAll the evidence shows that it is actually misconceptions about vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u201d such as those promoted by Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that cause serious harm. The United States has already experienced a series of outbreaks of preventable diseases. In 2014, measles affected 667 people in the country, primarily those who were unvaccinated. The outbreaks are expensive, too: in 2011, it cost public-health institutions up to US$5.3\u00c2\u00a0million to cope with 16 measles outbreaks that made 107\u00c2\u00a0people ill.\nIf Trump moves ahead with his vaccine commission, he will give a sense of legitimacy to opponents of childhood vaccination. This could undercut efforts in some states, such as Texas and Michigan, to strengthen vaccination requirements for schoolchildren.\nIn the wake of the news about the commission, the American Medical Association moved to reassert the safety of vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics said that it would welcome the chance to discuss vaccine safety with Trump.\nScientists, medics and commentators who have fought vaccine disinformation in the past must take a deep breath and return to the fray. There is no need to wait for this commission to be announced officially. There is no need to wait until it issues its findings. There is no cause to be surprised if it shows little regard for science \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or even if it targets scientists who speak out in favour of vaccination. Those who claim a link between vaccines and autism can do so only by discrediting the scientific evidence and, often, the scientists who gathered it. Kennedy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reference to investigating vaccine safety \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and scientific integrity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd provides ample warning of what is to come. Scientists should get their retaliation in first. Lives are at stake.\n","148":" Doubts about vaccines helped fuel Minnesota\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest outbreak of measles in decades, and attracted determined vaccine skeptics eager to exploit fear, health officials say. \n But the outbreak has not only caught people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention; it has helped demonstrate that anti-vaccine activists are wrong, state and county health officials say. \n At least 48 people have been infected, nearly all of them children, and 11 kids are in the hospital with pneumonia and other dangerous complications, the Minnesota department of health says. They expect more. \n The doubts and fears created a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural experiment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in which vaccination rates plummeted, and disease broke out, said David Johnson, program manager with the Hennepin County Health Department. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we have now is a community that was really influenced by these anti-vaccine groups. And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve performed a natural experiment: to forgo the measles vaccine based on this propaganda,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Johnson told NBC News. \n Somali immigrants have been the hardest hit by the outbreak, Minnesota\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health department said. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen that the vaccine rates in the community that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being affected right now were once about the same or even a little higher than our average. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dropped to about half of that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Johnson added. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And unfortunately now we are seeing the result. Measles is spreading rapidly in the community and 11 children are hospitalized. And at the same time there is no evidence of any corresponding drop in autism in the community.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \n Related: Measles Outbreak Traced to Disneyland is Over \n State and county health officials had been struggling to restore faith in vaccines among the Minneapolis-area Somali community for years. Autism rates do appear to be unusually high in the community, and parents looking for answers found long-discredited websites run by various groups claiming to show a link. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last project we were involved in we found that one in 32 Somali individuals have been diagnosed with autism from the severe end to mild,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mohamud Noor, Director of the Confederation of Somali Community in Minneapolis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is being highlighted in the community. There is fear.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \n Noor, himself the father of four young kids 10 and younger, said he even considered delaying their vaccinations. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I thought, why not wait a little bit?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told NBC News. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s someone who is as well informed as I. That message has been highly escalated and many people have been talking about it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \n Then, late August, producers of the film \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd came to Minnesota. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been back since, talking to concerned parents. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has been ongoing contact between outside groups who have come in and wanted to do organizing within the community that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s affected here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Johnson said. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really unfortunate because some of the anti-vaccine propaganda is largely to blame for what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in our community.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \n Related: Fatal Measles Complication Kills Years Later \n Noor said the anti-vaccine activists figured out they could not reach the approximately 25,000 members of Somali community by internet alone. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come in person, and he says that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how the public health officials will also have to work. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are an oral society. We spread the information neighbor to neighbor. It is more of a communal discussion that spreads better than the internet,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \n Although study after study has clearly demonstrated there is no link at all between vaccination and autism, vaccine critics continue to make their claims, using language of personal freedom and conspiracy theory to paint a picture of cynical doctors colluding with greedy pharmaceutical companies to promote harmful vaccines. \n Related: De Niro Says Find the Truth But Experts Already Did \n Often, they moderate their messages, saying they don't doubt all vaccines but simply want parents to be able to choose and want vaccines to be made safer. \n Doctors say the vaccine schedule has been carefully studied and ensures that children are vaccinated at the right times to keep them safe. Altering it does no good for the kids and often puts them at risk of infection. \n The so-called anti-vaxxer campaign distresses public health experts who see children needlessly sickened by vaccine-preventable diseases. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These groups continue to fabricate and promote alternative facts that have no bearing on reality,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Johnson said. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They've preyed on parents' concerns about the health of their children and they've provided them false hope that avoiding the measles vaccine will somehow prevent autism, when in fact not vaccinating only serves to increase the risk of a child getting a disease and then spreading it to others.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \n If there is one positive note to the outbreak, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that it has taken the conversation out of the shadows, said Johnson. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do have something we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a few months ago in our community and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full and undivided attention,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Johnson said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that we are hoping to be able to use in order to help promote the messaging.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \n Related: Seven Vaccine Myths Debunked \n And just what is the messaging? \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We tell the community that we know what causes measles,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Johnson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what causes autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \n While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to prevent measles \u00e2\u20ac\u201d with the vaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u201d no one knows how to prevent autism. And while no vaccine is 100 percent safe, the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine only rarely causes side-effects and it has been shown many times that autism is not one of them. \n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been studying how common autism is for years now. It's found it is a distressingly common diagnosis with somewhere between 1 in 45 and 1 in 68 kids having the condition. \n Related: Measles Vaccine Prevents More Than Measles \n There are certainly genetic links, and some evidence that infections in pregnancy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including those prevented by vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might cause autism. \n Public health experts have learned that it is important not to lecture parents worried about vaccines, but to listen to their fears, and to enlist familiar and trusted faces to help communicate. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think what it really comes down to is in communication what is important is trust,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Johnson said. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What these groups have told people is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyou can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the doctors. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the science. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the government. Trust us and we can show you how to protect your children from autism,'\" Johnson said. \n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They really exploited that relationship now in a way that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left children vulnerable to disease.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \n Researchers reported in 2015 that nearly 9 million U.S. children are not fully vaccinated against measles and risk getting infected. \n Pockets of unvaccinated or undervaccinated kids helped fuel an outbreak linked to Disneyland that infected 147 Americans linked to the festering controversy over vaccinating children. \n Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but a few imported cases come in every year. These can spread if people are not fully immunized. Globally, there are around 20 million cases and more than 145,000 children die of measles every year. \n The CDC says so far this year 61 people from 10 states (California, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Washington) were reported to with measles. \n In 2016, 70 cases were reported. CDC says 2014 was a record year with 667 cases. \n","149":"Ascending paralysis developed in 3 dogs, 12 to 14 days following inoculation with a modified live virus, chicken embryo origin, low egg passage, Flury strain rabies vaccine. The paralysis began in the inoculated limb but rapidly involved both hindlimbs. Partial paresis of the forelimbs was seen several days following the hindlimb paralysis in all 3 dogs, and in 1 of these dogs the infection ascended rapidly to the brain as well. Two of the dogs recovered within 1 and 2 months, respectively, but the 3rd dog died within 5 days of the onset of paralytic signs. The fatal case was complicated by naturally acquired coincidental distemper. Serologic studies in 2 dogs and virus isolation from the 3rd dog indicated that rabies virus was the cause of the paralysis in 2 of the dogs and contributed to the disease syndrome in the 3rd dog. Virus could not be isolated from the saliva of CSF of the 2 surviving dogs. The virus isolated in the fatal case appeared to have some of the characteristics of the vaccine virus, as determined by its behavior in mice, cell culture, and embryonating chicken eggs and by its failure to produce Negri bodies in the brain of the infected dog.\n","150":" \t\t\t\t\tFollowing on from the chickenpox thread, before I do some further research has anyone given this vaccine to their little ones and what were their ages when given and were there any side effects? \n I've read the thread and I had no idea how serious chickenpox could be and I'm wondering if it's worth preventing it altogether? \n \t\t\t\t\tMy dd has it at 13mth.she had a slight temp 3 days in.no probe and despite been round those with pox she hasn't got them,best 45quid iv spent!x \t\t\t\t\n I was quoted \u00c2\u00a3220 as it needs to be 2 injections 6 weeks apart?!

Generally it is just a mild illness, all be it irritating lol. Very few children have complications from it, when they do it is normally down to something else (health complications) meaning their immune system isn't able to deal with it. Of course there is some who have had it really bad and worse but it's not very common. But it's the same with anything really, flu etc. \n My ds1 has been exposed to it 3 times at school so far, 3 of his class friends got it at different times and he never caught it.

Thanks. \t\t\t\t\n","151":"The debate over vaccines and the overwhelming media coverage that it's attracted in light of a measles outbreak tends to obscure a key fact about Americans: More than 90 percent are vaccinated against measles and other diseases.\nBecause of that level of protection, measles was essentially eliminated from the United States by 2000; the few cases diagnosed in the dozen years that followed were from people who carried the disease back from foreign countries. (Read \"Why Do Many Reasonable People Doubt Science?\" in National Geographic magazine.)\nIn the past few years, however, native infections have been creeping up again. The latest outbreak\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich now includes more than a hundred infections\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas likely sparked by someone who visited a Disney theme park in California in late December, though officials say they probably won't be able to identify the person who triggered it.\nThe measles vaccine is 95 to 98 percent effective, but that small gap in effectiveness means that if a hundred vaccinated people are exposed to the disease, two to five of them could get sick. And the more people who are exposed, the more who will fall ill. A sick person at a popular attraction like Disneyland might expose thousands in a day.\nMost of the people who've gotten measles in the current outbreak were not vaccinated, according to Anne Schuchat, the assistant surgeon general and director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, part of the U.S .Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"This is not a problem with the measles vaccine not working. This is a problem of the measles vaccine not being used,\" she said at a news conference last week.\nIn recent decades, most American measles outbreaks have been started by people coming to the U.S. from other countries where the disease is more common, including Europe and the Philippines. Of the first 59 Californians who caught the measles in late December or January, the state has vaccine documentation on 34 of them, and 28 of those were not vaccinated, including 6 who were too young for the vaccination. Those 28 clearly contributed to the spread, officials said.\nOutbreaks generally require two things: an initial spark and enough unvaccinated people to feed the flames. Disneyland attracts visitors from all over the world, so someone who caught measles in another country could easily have carried it with them to the amusement park. There are relatively large numbers of unvaccinated children in California\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhere there have now been 92 recent infections\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecause of the state's liberal allowance to opt out of vaccinations on the basis of personal beliefs.\nOther recent outbreaks have struck an Amish community in Ohio and Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn, New York, communities in which vaccination rates are lower because of religious objections. Rates are also below 90 percent among preschoolers in 12 states, including Colorado, Arkansas, and Michigan. In California, 91 percent of preschoolers have gotten their measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to the 2013 National Immunization Survey.\nBut a small number of children can be harmed by any vaccination. In 1988, the federal government established a fund to cover vaccine injuries, which made payments to 2,542 families between 1988 and 2006. There's no way to identify ahead of time which few children will be harmed by vaccines. Many of those who avoid vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding some families with children who have autism\u00e2\u20ac\u201dworry that their child is particularly vulnerable and will suffer one of the rare cases of harm.\n\"We're really stuck now,\" says David Yassa, an infectious disease doctor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, adding that he doesn't know how to reassure people other than with the facts. \"The data is very clear in terms of the benefits and lack of risks of these vaccines.\"\nPeople who choose not to vaccinate their children are taking a risk both for their own child and for the larger community, Yassa says. The more people who are vaccinated, the lower the likelihood that the disease will be passed to someone who is too young to be vaccinated or is otherwise vulnerable to the disease.\nSomeone with a compromised immune system should not get the MMR vaccine because it includes live viruses, so theoretically it could make someone sick. For most other vaccines, like the polio vaccine and the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine known as DTaP, manufacturers use inactivated viruses that cannot transmit the disease.\nReligious and personal exemptions do not endanger other people, as long as roughly 95 percent of the population is vaccinated, creating what's called herd immunity. If the numbers of unvaccinated climb or there are pockets with lower protection, it can lead to outbreaks when the disease arrives from abroad.\nFor those who are fully vaccinated, the risk of contracting measles is very low. First, you or your child would have to be exposed to the disease\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand right now, only about a hundred people are infected in a country of 350 million. Then you'd have to be among the unlucky few who gets sick despite vaccination. Of those who get sick, fewer than a handful out of a thousand cases are extremely serious or life-threatening, according to the CDC.\nMost Americans who are older than 51 were exposed to measles in childhood, when the virus was common in the United States, and so developed immunity. Beginning in 1963, children received one dose of the vaccine, which was about 93 percent protective. In the late 1980s, researchers discovered that a second dose bumped the protectiveness up to about 98 percent. Since then, American children have been given two doses, one at 12-15 months and the second no later than ages four to six.\nThe people who received only one dose, who are now mainly in their 30s and 40s, have slightly less protection than younger or older people. It's also possible that some people, particularly those vaccinated outside the United States, where the supply of vaccine might not have been kept continuously cold, didn't get an effective dose. Doctors may recommend vaccination before traveling overseas to a country where the disease is present.\nMeasles is one of the most contagious diseases we know. In a roomful of unvaccinated people, 90 percent would get measles if one sick person entered. The virus passes through droplets in the air, usually from someone sneezing or coughing, and can blow through or hang in the air for a while. Tight spaces like elevators can be points of transmission, with germs lingering for hours.\nAbout eight to ten days after exposure, the person develops a fever, runny nose, and maybe muscle aches. Red eyes are also common. Most patients have a rash that starts on the face and moves downward and outward, with blotchy red spots that can blend together. The virus's contagious period usually lasts from about four days before the rash starts, and before a person could know he or she has the disease, until four days after.\nMeasles can be reliably diagnosed if the patient has most of those symptoms plus little whitish spots in the mouth, usually on the gums across from molar teeth. Because the disease has been rare since vaccination began more than 50 years ago, most doctors today have never seen a case of measles.\nIn most people, the symptoms go away in one or two weeks. A small number of people can develop pneumonia or neurological conditions that can be life-threatening and long-lasting. The most vulnerable are children under a year old, who are too young to have been vaccinated; pregnant women; and people with compromised immune systems, such as older adults and those getting treated for cancer.\n","152":"The outbreak is thought to have started at California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Disneyland in December and the number of confirmed cases currently stands at 121, according to the US Centres for Disease and Control (CDC).\nMORE: WORST MEASLES OUTBREAK IN 20 YEARS \nParents across the country are terrified.\nOne social media post by a young mother Jennifer Hibben-White from Toronto, Canada, whose 15-day-old son Griffin was exposed to the potentially deadly virus has captured this fear in the most potent way, going viral after thousands of anxious parents shared her chilling story.\nNews.com.au has reposted her powerful message below:\nThis is my son Griffin, and he may have measles.\nOn February 9th, I received a phone call from York Region Public Health, informing me that Griffin, alongside my mother and I, was potentially exposed to the measles virus while attending a newborn weigh-in appointment at my doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office in Markham on January 27th. \nGriffin was 15 days old at the time.\nI was informed that someone who later developed measles sat in the doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waiting room between 1 hour before and 30 minutes before we arrived. I was also informed that measles is regarded as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153airborne\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and can stay in the air and on surfaces up to 2 hours after the infected person has left. \nI was then asked if I had had the measles vaccine. I had.\nGriffin. Griffin had not. Can not.\nI was advised to not be around small children. If I worked in such an environment I would be written off work. I do work in such an environment; my home. Where I now sit with Griffin and my 3 year old, Aurelia, who has only been able to get one MMR vaccine so far. She is now, technically, exposed too. We are to sit tight and watch for symptoms: fever, cough, runny nose. If we develop any of these we are to call my doctor and arrange to come in under official medical precautions. We are to wait at home, in isolation, until February 17th, after which the 21 days of possible incubation will have passed and we are clear.\nSo, Griffin is now Schr\u00c3\u00b6dinger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s baby. Simultaneously with measles, and without it. Until he develops symptoms, or until a further 7 days pass. One or other.\nAnd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m angry. Angry as hell.\nI won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get angry at or blame the person in the waiting room. I would have likely done the same thing...you get sick, you go to the doctor. I have no idea what their story is and I will never know. But I do know one thing:\nIf you have chosen to not vaccinate yourself or your child, I blame you.\nI blame you.\nYou have stood on the shoulders of our collective protection for too long. From that high height, we have given you the PRIVILEGE of our protection, for free. And in return, you gave me this week. A week from hell. Wherein I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if my BABY will develop something that has DEATH as a potential outcome.\nNow, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unpack this shall we. All out on the table.\nYou have NO IDEA what this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potential outcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd means. NO IDEA. I do. Unfortunately, I do.\nYou think you are protecting your children from thimerosal? You aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not in their vaccine.\nYou think you are protecting them from autism? You aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. There is no, none, nada, nothing in science that proves this. If you want to use google instead of science to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prove me wrong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd then I am happy to call you an imbecile as well as misinformed.\nYou think you are protecting them through extracts and homeopathy and positive thoughts and Laws of Attraction and dancing by candlelight on a full moon? You aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I PROTECT YOUR CHILD. We protect your child. By being concerned world citizens who care about ourselves, our fellow man, and our most vulnerable. So we vaccinate ourselves and our children.\nYou think you are protecting them by letting them eat their shovel full of dirt and reducing antibiotics and eating organic? You aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. As an unvaccinated person you are only protected by our good graces. WE LET YOU BE SO PRIVILEGED thanks to our willingness to vaccinate ourselves and our children.\nYou know what vaccines protect your children from? Pain. Suffering. Irreparable harm. Death.\nAnd you would be the first to line up if you had an inkling of what the death of a child feels like. You would be crawling through the streets on your hands and knees, begging, BEGGING to get that vaccine into your precious babies because that is what I would have done, if I could, to save my daughter.\nThe fact is, there was no vaccine for her. Not for her illness. And she died. She died at age five and a half, and she is gone.\nAnd I watch these arguments trotted out on Facebook and twitter citing false science and long discredited\u00e2\u20ac\u0153studies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that just won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop and Jenny McCarthy quotes and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MY choice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to not vaccinate...and I think...what would you have done if your child lay dying? Would you give them a scientifically proven, safe and effective vaccine and risk the minuscule likelihood of a side effect? Or would you let them go, knowing that at least they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t develop autism (which they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even develop anyway because SCIENCE)? \nAnd don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you DARE tell me that you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate them then. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you dare. You have no idea what it feels like to go through what we went through.\nSo, look at Griffin. Tell me why he gets to bear the brunt of your stupidity and reckless abuse of our protection? Tell me.\nSeven more days until I know that my baby is safe.

There have also been outbreaks in the South West and London.\nMeasles is a highly infectious illness that can be very unpleasant and can cause serious complications. The MMR vaccination provides the only protection against measles.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere's what to do in the event of a measles outbreak near you.\nThis page covers:\nWhy is it so important to be vaccinated against measles? \nHow easy is it to catch measles? \nCan adults catch measles? \nWe live a long way from the outbreak, so should I be worried? \nWhat if I'm going close to an area with an outbreak? \nCan my children still have the MMR vaccination if they weren't vaccinated as babies? \nCan a baby under 6 months have the MMR vaccine? \nI'm not sure if my\u00c2\u00a0children are already vaccinated?

About 1 in 5 children with measles experiences complications such as ear infections, diarrhoea and vomiting, pneumonia, meningitis, and eye disorders. One in 10 children with measles ends up in hospital. There is no treatment for the disease. Vaccination is the only way of preventing it.\nMeasles spreads very easily.\u00c2\u00a0In fact, it's one of the most infectious diseases known. You can catch measles if you spend just 15 minutes with someone who has the disease.\nRead more about measles\u00c2\u00a0and the MMR vaccination. \nYes. And adults are likely to be more ill than children and for longer. Someone with measles generally has to spend 5 days in bed and be off work for 10 days. Adults are also more prone to measles complications than children.\nOutbreaks of measles can happen anywhere at any time. Wherever you live in the UK, it's important that your children or teenagers\u00c2\u00a0are up to date with their MMR and other childhood vaccinations. \nIf your child has already had two doses of MMR vaccine, you don't need to worry. \nSimilarly, if your child had their first dose of MMR as a baby,\u00c2\u00a0but they are not yet old enough to have received their second dose, they are up to date and there is no need to have the second MMR dose earlier than scheduled.\nHowever, if\u00c2\u00a0your child is\u00c2\u00a0school-age and has\u00c2\u00a0only had one MMR dose, or has not been vaccinated at all, they should be vaccinated as soon as possible.\nFind out which vaccinations are available on the NHS.\nIf you have plans to travel to an area where there has been an outbreak of measles, make immediate arrangements with your GP for your children or teenagers\u00c2\u00a0to receive the MMR vaccination if they haven't\u00c2\u00a0had both doses\u00c2\u00a0before. \nBabies and young children can have\u00c2\u00a0doses of the\u00c2\u00a0vaccination earlier or closer together\u00c2\u00a0than usual in special circumstances.\nYes. It's never too late for your children and teenagers\u00c2\u00a0(or you) to \"catch up\" with MMR vaccination if you or they missed it earlier. Children\u00c2\u00a0up to the age of 18\u00c2\u00a0and adults without immunity\u00c2\u00a0should have a catch-up MMR vaccination. \nNo.\u00c2\u00a0Babies under 6 months usually have\u00c2\u00a0some\u00c2\u00a0antibodies to measles already in their system\u00c2\u00a0passed\u00c2\u00a0on from their mum\u00c2\u00a0at birth, which may give them some protection for the first few months. But this residual immunity\u00c2\u00a0also interferes with their\u00c2\u00a0response to the MMR vaccine.\nSo, the best approach for\u00c2\u00a0children under 6 months\u00c2\u00a0is to try to\u00c2\u00a0avoid them having any\u00c2\u00a0contact with measles. \nIt's also a good idea to make sure the rest of your family have had the MMR jab, especially if you are planning to visit an outbreak area,\u00c2\u00a0as the greatest risk is in the household. \nMMR vaccination is usually given as a first dose around the age of 13 months and again as a \"booster\" jab before school between the ages of 3 and 5.\nIf your child has already had the vaccine,\u00c2\u00a0it should be recorded in their medical notes and in their personal health record (the Red Book). Ask your GP or practice manager if you're not sure.\nFind your local GP.\nIf you or your GP are unsure whether your children or teenagers\u00c2\u00a0have been vaccinated against measles before, go ahead and arrange to have them vaccinated again. It won't hurt them to have\u00c2\u00a0the MMR vaccination a second or third time. \nNo. MMR vaccination is available to adults and children free on the NHS.\nIt's extremely unlikely, but you need 2 doses of MMR to be fully protected. The first dose of the MMR jab protects 90% of\u00c2\u00a0those who receive it,\u00c2\u00a0and the second dose tops this up to 99% protection.\nSimply call your local GP practice and make an appointment for an MMR jab. It involves 2 doses, which can be given just a month apart to give protection as quickly as possible. \nIf you aren't registered with a GP, find the nearest doctor's surgery, who will give your family the jabs.\u00c2\u00a0\nRead more about how the MMR jab is given.\nIt's not just children who can benefit from MMR vaccination. \nYoung people and adults who are unsure whether they've had measles or been vaccinated\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly if they're carers or work with children\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c can have the MMR vaccine on the NHS from their GP. \nBear in mind that most adults born before 1970 are likely to be immune because they have probably been exposed to measles already.\nWatch part one of the vaccination series to find out why not being vaccinated because of worries about side effects means serious illnesses can become more common.\nWatch the second part of a series about immunisation to find out why it's important to stay up-to-date with your vaccinations.\nLearn how measles is transmitted, how to recognise the infection and to treat it.\nWith an account you can keep track of pages on the site and save them to this tab, which you can access on every page when you are logged in.\n","158":"Vaccines work by making us produce antibodies to fight disease without actually infecting us with the disease.\nIf the vaccinated person then comes into contact with the disease itself, their immune system will recognise it and immediately produce the antibodies\u00c2\u00a0they need\u00c2\u00a0to fight it.\nNewborn babies are already protected against several diseases, such as measles, mumps and rubella, because antibodies have passed to them from their mothers via the placenta. This is called passive immunity. \nPassive immunity usually only lasts for a few weeks or months. In the case of measles, mumps and rubella, it may last up to one year, which is why the\u00c2\u00a0MMR jab\u00c2\u00a0is given to children just after their first birthday.\nThe first step is to make the organism that produces the disease, which is\u00c2\u00a0called the pathogen. The pathogen is a virus or a bacterium. Viruses and bacteria can be mass-produced in the laboratory by infecting cells grown in tissue culture.\nThe pathogen must then be altered to ensure it doesn't trigger the disease itself. The treated pathogen is then combined with other vaccine\u00c2\u00a0ingredients, such as stabilisers and preservatives, to produce a vaccine dose. \nYou might be concerned that giving\u00c2\u00a0too many vaccines at\u00c2\u00a0the same time will\u00c2\u00a0\"overload\" your child's immune system, especially at one year of age,\u00c2\u00a0when four injections are given in a single session.\u00c2\u00a0\nBut this isn't the case.\u00c2\u00a0Studies have shown there are no harmful effects from giving multiple injections or vaccines in one session. \nAs soon as a baby is born they come into contact with a huge number of different bacteria and viruses every day, and their immune system copes with them and becomes stronger as a result. \nThe bacteria and viruses used in vaccines are weakened or killed, and there are far fewer of them than the natural bugs that babies and children come into contact with. \nImmunisation helps to improve protection against\u00c2\u00a0life-threatening diseases at the very earliest opportunity.\nWatch this short animation to find out more. \nSome vaccines provide very high levels of protection\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example, MMR provides 90% protection against measles and rubella after one dose. Others are not as effective \u00e2\u20ac\u201c typhoid vaccine, a travel vaccine, provides around 70% protection over three years.\nWhen a vaccination programme is introduced, everyone in the population of a certain age or\u00c2\u00a0risk group is offered a specific vaccine to try\u00c2\u00a0to reduce the number of cases of the disease.\nVaccination programmes aim to protect people for life. They often concentrate on young children, as they're\u00c2\u00a0particularly\u00c2\u00a0vulnerable to many potentially dangerous infections. \nSome vaccination programmes are targeted at older people, as with the shingles vaccine,\u00c2\u00a0or certain risk groups, as with the hepatitis B vaccine.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWhen a vaccination programme against a disease begins, the number of people catching the disease goes down. As the threat decreases, it's important to keep vaccinating, otherwise the disease can start to spread again.\nIf enough people in a community are vaccinated, it's harder for a disease to pass between\u00c2\u00a0people who have not been vaccinated. This is called herd immunity.\nHerd immunity is particularly important\u00c2\u00a0for protecting people who can't get vaccinated because they're too ill or\u00c2\u00a0because they're having treatment that damages their immune system.\nPublic Health England (PHE)\u00c2\u00a0records the vaccinations that adults and children receive.\u00c2\u00a0PHE also records the number of cases of each disease each year. \nThis way,\u00c2\u00a0PHE can work out the impact that each vaccination has on a particular disease. This data helps the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)\u00c2\u00a0consider whether the routine vaccination programme needs to be changed.\nAs more of the population is vaccinated, the disease can sometimes disappear completely and the vaccination programme can be stopped, as has happened with smallpox.\nThe more infectious the disease, the greater the number of people who have to be vaccinated to keep the disease under control. Measles, for instance, is highly infectious. If vaccination rates go down, measles will quickly spread again.\nWe know that at least 90% of children have to be immune to stop the disease from spreading. If 95% of children are protected by MMR, it's possible to eliminate not just measles, but mumps and rubella as well.\nWatch part one of the vaccination series to find out why not being vaccinated because of worries about side effects means serious illnesses can become more common.\nWith an account you can keep track of pages on the site and save them to this tab, which you can access on every page when you are logged in.\n","159":"A vaccine is available to help protect people at risk of being exposed to rabies.\nBut even if you've been vaccinated, you should get urgent medical help if you're bitten or scratched by an animal that may have had rabies.\nThis page covers:\nWho should have the rabies vaccine\nWhere to get it\nWill I have to pay for it?\nHow it's given\nBooster doses\nSide effects\nYou should consider getting vaccinated against rabies if: \nyou're travelling to an area where rabies is common and you plan to stay for a month or more or there's unlikely to be quick access to appropriate medical care \nyou're travelling to an area where rabies is common and you plan to do activities that could put you at increased risk of exposure to animals with rabies, such as running or cycling \nFor information about areas where rabies is a risk, see:\nIt takes three to four weeks to complete the vaccine course, so you ideally need to start it at least a month before you plan to leave.\nPregnant women are advised to have the rabies vaccine if the risk of exposure to rabies is thought to be high and there's limited access to medical care.\nVaccination is also recommended for anyone at risk of being exposed to rabies through their job, such as:\npeople who regularly handle bats \npeople who handle imported animals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as workers at zoos or animal quarantine centres \nlaboratory workers who handle rabies samples \nIf you think this applies to you, speak to your occupational health department.\nYour local GP surgery may be able to give you the rabies vaccination, although you may need to pay for it (see below).\nAlternatively, you can pay for the vaccine at a private travel vaccination clinic.\nYou will usually have to pay for the rabies vaccine if you need it for protection while travelling.\nThe vaccine involves three doses.

Now the outbreak has ballooned to 234 cases at last count, and has spilled into the surrounding community in Columbus, Ohio.\n\"Columbus officials are calling it the city's biggest outbreak since the development of the mumps vaccine in the 1940s,\" WOSU reporter Steve Brown tells Shots. \"It even pushed them to open a new clinic.\"\nSo far, most of those infected are students or workers at Ohio State, Brown says. And here's what's surprising: Many of those who got sick had previously been immunized against mumps via one of the top weapons against childhood diseases: the MMR vaccine. That's a two-dose shot most of us got when we were kids to protect against three diseases \u00e2\u20ac\u201d measles, mumps and rubella.\nInterestingly, a young woman in New York caught the measles in 2011 even though she, too, had been vaccinated, scientists reported last week. \"Measles Mary,\" as Science magazine called her, also spread the virus to four others.\nWhat's going on here? Is one of our best shields against infectious illness faltering?\nTo answer those questions, we talked with a vaccine specialist, Dr. William Schaffner at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nWhy can you still get the mumps and measles even if you're vaccinated?\nMeasles is a terrific vaccine. If you get two doses, it's predicted to protect 99.99 percent of people for life.\nThat case in New York was so unusual that it's come to everyone's attention. On rare occasions, the virus trumps an individual's protection.\nThe mumps vaccine, on the other hand, is not so good. The protection rate varies from study to study. But it's usually in the mid-80s.\nBoth vaccines, for mumps and measles, are tamed versions of the viruses. The viruses aren't killed but what we call attenuated, live viruses.\nIf you don't attenuate the mumps virus enough, you get better protection but more complications with the vaccine.\nSo we're walking a fine line. To avoid complications, the mumps vaccine doesn't protect as well as the measles.\nWe wish we had a better mumps vaccine.\nSo the outbreak at Ohio State University is due to \"vaccine failure,\" not declining immunization rates in the U.S.?\nYes. In the U.S., we have done a stupendous job of comprehensively vaccinating children. We have the best vaccination record in the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I'm proud to stay, sitting up with a big smile on my face.\nBut every developed country hasn't gotten with the program. So we have mumps cases imported into the U.S. from Europe and the U.K.\nWell, hello \u00e2\u20ac\u201d if the British vaccinated everyone, there would be less importation and fewer outbreaks in the U.S.\nWith the situation in Ohio, what we'll probably find is that the vaccine protected about 85 percent of the people. So you can see that some people who were vaccinated can acquire the illness \u00e2\u20ac\u201d if they're exposed.\nWith measles and rubella, protection rates of the vaccine are up in the mid- 90s. What drives these outbreaks in the U.S. are children that have been withheld from vaccines. So it's failure to vaccinate, not vaccine failure \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as with mumps.\nAre you saying that vaccines don't work as well when large groups of people aren't immunized?\nCorrect. Vaccines have two functions: Protect the person vaccinated and provide protection to the entire community.\nIf you want to eliminate the infection entirely from a community, a very high proportion of people have to be immunized.\nIf children are left unvaccinated, measles will find them and make them sick. It's one of the most contagious diseases we have.\nMumps is not quite as communicable. But with only about 85 percent of a population protected by the vaccine, outbreaks can smolder along and infect just enough people to keep going.\nTo protect yourself, the No. 1 priority is to make sure everyone is vaccinated. If you know of someone who has the mumps, avoid them.\nShould adults get a booster of the MMR to protect against mumps outbreaks?\nWe recommend everyone gets two doses of the MMR vaccine.\nThen, if there is a mumps outbreak in your community, like in Ohio, health workers will figure out which population is at risk and give them a third dose.\nShots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

Seven of the patients live in California and two live in Utah.\nState and county health officers are investigating an additional four suspected cases \u00e2\u20ac\u201d two in Utah and two in California. All of the patients visited the parks in Orange County between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20, California Department of Public Health officials said.\n\"If you have symptoms, and believe you may have been exposed, please contact your health care provider,\" Dr. Ron Chapman, CDPH director and state health officer, said in a statement. \"The best way to prevent measles and its spread is to get vaccinated.\"\nKathleen Harriman, chief of vaccine preventable diseases for the state, said that \"it's our speculation that there was an [infected] international visitor at one of the parks, and that person or persons was able to infect a lot of people.\"\nMeasles is very infectious because it spreads through the air, so you can catch it by, say, standing in line next to someone who is infected. Vaccination eliminated measles in the United States in 2000. \"So all the cases of measles in the United States originate with an imported case,\" Harriman said, \"even though there can be transmission once one of those cases gets here.\"\nThe California cases are in Alameda, Orange, Pasadena, Riverside and San Diego. The patients range in age from 8 months to 21 years. Of the seven California cases, six had not been vaccinated. Two were too young to have been vaccinated; the first of two recommended measles vaccine doses is typically given at 1 year of age.\nJust one of the cases was fully vaccinated. Harriman said that while the measles vaccine is highly effective, conferring lifelong immunity in 99 percent of people who receive two doses, there will always be a small number of people who can get infected despite being vaccinated.\nOne of the cases is in Alameda County. Deputy Chief Health Officer Dr. Erica Pan said officials there are \"working with the health facility where the patient was seen\" to identify other patients and health care workers who may have been exposed.\nPan said health officers will quarantine susceptible contacts, especially those at high risk of developing disease, \"to make sure that contact stays home and away from other people to make sure that person does not infect others.\"\nInitial measles symptoms include fever, cough, running nose and red eyes. After a few days, a red rash appears on the face and then spreads downward to the rest of the body. People who are infected can spread the disease for days before the rash appears, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nPan said if people are concerned, they \"should check on their immunization status and get vaccinated\" if needed.\nDisney officials told The Associated Press that they had received no reports of staff contracting measles. Park officials are working with the health department to provide any necessary information, according to Dr. Pamela Hymel, chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.\nThis story was produced by State of Health, KQED's health blog.\nShots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

One syringe was reused over the course of four days.\nThe campaign, which took place in early May in the rural town of Kapoeta, was part of an effort by the South Sudanese government to vaccinate 2 million children against measles. The vaccines were provided by UNICEF. The World Health Organization provided some training in how to administer the vaccines.\nHow could something like this happen?\nWe talked to William Moss \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a professor of epidemiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the head of epidemiology at the International Vaccine Access Center \u00e2\u20ac\u201d about what went wrong.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nThis is a tragedy on so many levels. How could this have happened?\nSouth Sudan has been plagued by a civil war, conflict, famine and other outbreaks for three years. Measles vaccination campaigns are complex operations with logistical challenges \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and this is a place with poor health infrastructure. That's not an excuse, but it provides some context in understanding how such a thing could have happened.\nIn addition to the deaths, 32 children were sickened from the 300-person vaccination campaign in South Sudan. What went wrong, exactly?\nUntrained people were administering the vaccine. The measles vaccine needs to be diluted. One has to take a liquid and mix it with the dry form, and that's where the error occurred. The [WHO and UNICEF] report says they used the same syringe to reconstitute the vaccine [instead of discarding it after single use]. If that vaccine vial gets contaminated with a toxin or bacteria, then gets injected into a child, that's what causes disease and death.\nSome reports are saying children as young as 12 years old were administering the vaccine.\nI have never heard of children being used in a vaccination campaign before, so this would be highly, highly unusual. Measles is administered with a needle and syringe. In measles vaccination campaigns, it's trained health care workers who deliver the vaccine. For polio vaccines where it's oral, you can have trained lay people administer the vaccine, but not children. If in fact children were administering the vaccine, that's inexcusable.\nDoes this show that there was pressure to rush this measles campaign in South Sudan? In 2016, there were 2,294 suspected  measles cases.\nMeasles is a public health problem [in South Sudan]. A measles outbreak can be devastating with high death rates in part because of the undernutrition of the population and the lack of access to health care services. You have the urgent need to get the population vaccinated \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but in this village where [this vaccination campaign] occurred, there was improper staffing in terms of administering the vaccines.\nDo you anticipate this will slow down vaccination campaigns around the world?\nThat's obviously a big concern. This is a tragedy on multiple levels, primarily for the children and families who were involved in this. When an event like this happens, there's a lot of concern that this will decrease the willingness of parents to have their children vaccinated against measles.\nWhat people need to know is that this is a rare event. The problem is not the measles vaccine, which is very safe. This is a failure of the health system.\nAccording to the Red Cross in South Sudan, some mothers are angry  and are unconvinced they should take their children to get vaccinated. What will groups need to do to reassure these mothers that vaccines are safe?\nThe organizations involved in the campaign, such as WHO and UNICEF, need to ensure that anyone administering the measles vaccine in South Sudan is trained and qualified to do so. The government of South Sudan needs to ensure that this doesn't happen again.\nOftentimes in these types of settings, it comes down to community leaders. Groups like the Red Cross and [aid groups] on the ground would need to engage with those leaders to point out the value and importance of measles vaccinations, particularly in these communities at high risk of measles outbreaks and deaths. If not, it might be extremely difficult to turn this around.\nGiven the anti-vaccine movement in the West and skepticism about vaccines in many poorer nations, how much of a setback is this for vaccine efforts around the world?\nThe anti-vaccine movement is complicated. But my understanding is that the argument against vaccines is not based on this type of event. They raise different issues, but not around the possibility of a vaccine vial getting contaminated with bacteria or people dying from toxins.\nStill, events like these generate a lot of negative publicity around vaccines. Anytime there's an event like this, it's a major setback for the global vaccine efforts. It takes a long time to establish trust.\nWhat else should we know about the measles vaccine?\nWe have to remember that the introduction of the measles vaccine saves millions of children's lives each year. Prior to the introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s, millions of children died each year from measles. Now slightly over 100,000 people are estimated to die each year. This is an enormous public health success story.\nThis is why the measles vaccine campaign continued in South Sudan after this tragedy. This wasn't a problem with the vaccine. This was a problem unique to that village.\n","170":" \tThe rapid spread of a measles outbreak from Disneyland in California to communities around the country suggests that vaccination rates in some places may be as low as 50 percent, a study suggests.\n \t\"Disneyland is an international attraction and sometimes people are coming from places where measles vaccination rates are low or they don't get the recommended two doses, and that, combined with the fact that there are a lot of pockets of non-vaccination in California and people coming from all over the U.S. created the perfect storm for a big outbreak,\" lead author Maimuna Majumder of Boston Children's Hospital and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told Reuters Health.\n \tThis year, the U.S. is experiencing a multi-state measles outbreak believed to have started at Disneyland this past December, as well as three other unrelated outbreaks in Illinois, Nevada, and Washington, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of March 6, 173 people from 17 states and the District of Columbia were reported to have measles, with most linked back to Disneyland.\n \tMeasles is a highly contagious virus that can be serious or even fatal. It starts with a fever that can last a couple of days, followed by a cough, runny nose, and pink eye. A rash develops on the face and neck then spreads to the rest of the body. In severe cases, pneumonia and encephalitis can develop.\n \tPeople with measles can be spreading the virus for four days before and after the rash appears, according to the CDC.\n \tThe virus can live for up to two hours on surfaces where an infected person coughs or sneezes. People who breathe the contaminated air or touch an infected surface and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth can become infected.\n \tAbout 96 to 99 percent of people in the community need to be vaccinated against measles to effectively halt its spread. Because about 7 percent of people won't get immunity from one dose of the vaccine, two doses are recommended in the U.S.\n \tBefore the vaccine was developed, each person with measles typically infected 11 to 18 others, Majumder and colleagues write in JAMA Pediatrics.\n \tBased on historical infection rates and the number of individuals infected in the current outbreak, the researchers estimate that vaccination rates in some communities might be as low as 50 percent and probably are no higher than 86 percent.\n \t\"Clearly, based on the number of infections we have seen so far, we can say that (the current vaccination rate) is far below the level necessary to achieve herd immunity,\" Majumder said.\n \tThe timing of the current outbreak, starting during school vacations for many people in the U.S., likely made measles spread more quickly, said Dr. George Rutherford, vice chair of the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, in a phone interview.\n \t\"There's nothing magic about Disneyland except that there are a lot of people there,\" said Rutherford, who wasn't involved in the study. \"If anything, because it's outdoors and so spread out, it might be a little harder to transmit.\"\n \tStill, mixing tourists from countries where vaccination rates are low, with U.S. kids whose parents don't vaccinate them for medical or personal reasons, is a likely cause of the current outbreak, he said.\n \t\"In this scenario, any one child with measles is going to quickly spread it to just about every other child around them who isn't already immune,\" Rutherford said.\n \tON A MOBILE DEVICE?

Illness and death from diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), and Haemophilus influenzae (     H. influenzae)     type b are at or near record lows. In adults, immunizations against influenza (the flu), pneumococcal pneumonia, hepatitis, and other ailments have likewise saved many lives and prevented many cases of serious illness. A new vaccine has been shown to be highly effective against some strains of a virus that leads to cervical cancer.   \nMore than 70 bacteria, viruses, parasites, and other infectious microbes cause major human disease. Fortunately, vaccines are either available or being developed against a portion of them. With the advent of new or newly feared biological threats, emerging infections, and bacterial resistance to common antibiotics, immunizations are assuming an increasingly important role in maintaining the health of billions of people worldwide.\nOur bodies are designed to protect us from infections. When you are exposed to a virus or bacteria, your immune system actually learns from the experience. The next time your body is exposed to the same infection, your immune system often recognizes it and sets out to destroy it.\nImmunization exposes you to a very small, very safe amount of the most important infections. This exposure helps your immune system recognize and attack the infection and prevent the disease it may cause. If you are exposed to the full-blown disease later in life, you will either not become infected or have a much milder infection.\nMost vaccines are given by an injection, but some can be taken orally (by mouth) or by a nasal spray. They usually contain one of four components that cause an immune response:\n       A       live       but weakened virus. Live-virus vaccines provide longer immunity than inactivated ones, but they can cause serious infection in people with weakened immune systems, and have also been associated with severe medical disorders in rare instances.     \n       Inactivated       bacteria, viruses, or toxoids. Inactivated vaccines are safe even in people with impaired immune systems.     \n       A       toxoid,       is an altered form of a harmful substance (toxin) released by certain bacteria. The toxoid in vaccines is changed so it does not harm the person, but still produces an immune response.     \n       Bacterial or viral components       are not the whole organism, but only parts of the microbe that trigger a strong immune response.     \nThe harmless infectious component in the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the full-strength, live, and harmful substance or organism. The immune system than knows to attack it real exposure occurs. The antibodies produced in response to the vaccine remain in the body, preventing future illness from such an exposure. This is called immunity.\n     Combination Vaccines.     The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians recommend that health care providers use, whenever possible, combination vaccines instead of individual components. Combination vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP), and for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), have been available for years. New combinations that cover up to 5 vaccinations are being developed and are proving to be safe and well tolerated in infants as young as 2 months. For example, one that combines DTaP, hepatitis B, and the polio vaccine (Pediarix) is available It is as effective as the individual vaccines when given to children ages 6 weeks to 6 years.   \nThere is some concern that increasing use of combinations may reduce the potency of some of the vaccines. Some parents are also worried about increased side effects. Studies to date, however, are reporting that combinations are effective and safe.\n     Passive Immunity.     Another form of protection against disease is called passive immunity. This approach uses     immune globulin     , which are blood products containing antibodies. Immune globulin is generally used for people who cannot be vaccinated, when immediate protection is required, or to prevent severe complications of the disease. In some circumstances, passive immunity can interfere with active vaccinations, particularly live-virus vaccines. Therefore, if possible, these two immunization types should not be administered within weeks or even months of each other.   \n     General Information on Side Effects.     Vaccines can have side effects, which are nearly always mild, such as swelling at the injection site or fever. There have been a number of reports in the popular press about alarming side effects in many vaccines. Anti-vaccine groups vocally oppose immunizations in children. Although it is true that no vaccine is 100% safe, childhood infections have not been wiped out. Without immunization, parents risk exposing their children to diseases that in the past have killed millions of young children.   \n     Routine Childhood Vaccines.     Experts recommend that all children be routinely vaccinated against the following diseases:   \nMeasles\nMumps\nRubella (German measles)\nDiphtheria\nTetanus\nPertussis (whooping cough)\nPoliomyelitis (polio)\nVaricella (chickenpox)\nHepatitis B\nHepatitis A\n       H. influenzae       type b (a cause of meningitis)     \nInfluenza (children aged 6 months to 18 years)\nPneumococcal disease\nMeningococcal disease (recommended for all children ages 11 and up; recommended for high-risk children 2-10 years of age).\nRotavirus (children aged 6 - 32 weeks)\nMany vaccinations are first given during infancy. Even premature infants can, in most cases, be given vaccinations on a normal schedule. Note: These facts pertain to children in the United States. Children from other countries have not been well studied. Parents who adopt internationally may want to have their children's immunity assessed by a physician. Some evidence suggests that their medical records may not correctly reflect immunization status and that many adopted children, such as those from China, have not had many important vaccinations.\n     Common Adolescent and Adult Vaccines.     Vaccinations against the following disorders are also recommended routinely for certain adults. More information on these vaccines is discussed in the     Specific Vaccinations     section:   \nInfluenza (flu) (highly encouraged for all adults)\nPneumococcal pneumonia.\nHepatitis A and B and Meningococcal vaccine.\nTetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis.\nMeasles, mumps, rubella.\nHerpes zoster (shingles) vaccine\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV)\nVaricella (chickenpox)\nInactivated-virus and toxoid vaccines are usually safe in pregnant women, although any vaccination should be delayed, if possible, until the second or third trimester. Because of a possible risk to the fetus, live-virus vaccines should not be given to pregnant women or those likely to become pregnant within 28 days unless such women need immediate protection against life-threatening diseases, such as yellow fever, that are only prevented using live-virus vaccines. The live-virus MMR combination, which vaccinates against measles, mumps, and rubella, is not given to pregnant women because of the theoretical risk of the live-rubella vaccine to the fetus.\nIn general, vaccines are not completely effective for patients whose immune systems are compromised by disease or medications. Often, such patients are given immune globulin if they are exposed to infection. It may take 3 months to 1 year before a person who has stopped taking immunosuppressant drugs regains the full ability to be successfully immunized against disease.\nLive-virus vaccines are not usually given to people whose immune system has been compromised by illness or by the use of medications.\nPeople who should not get live-virus vaccinations include:\nPersons who have immune deficiency diseases (such as HIV or AIDS).\nPatients with active leukemia or lymphoma.\nPatients who are receiving treatments that suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation. (There are important exceptions, however, which are noted in the discussion of individual vaccinations below.) Short-term corticosteroids (given for less than 2 weeks) should not affect any live-virus vaccination. Patients who need vaccinations and who take long-term or high-dose topical steroids should check with their physicians.\n2 months\n4 months\n6 months\nHib (Depending on brand. For example, no third dose is required for PedvaxHIB or ComVax.)\n12 to 15 months\nDTaP* (Typically between 15 and 18 months.

Two or 3 doses a few months apart.\nMMR (If vaccinations were previously missed).\n* A one-shot combination vaccine (Pediarix) has been approved that covers polio, hepatitis B, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DTaP) and should simplify the immunization process. It would be given as a single injection at 2, 4, and 6 months with booster shots given at 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years.\n**All children aged 6 months - 18 years should receive an annual flu shot. Children younger than 9 years of age, who are receiving this vaccine for the first time (or who were vaccinated for the first time during the previous season with only 1 dose) should receive 2 doses of the flu vaccine at least 4 weeks apart.\n*** Two types of meningococcal vaccine are available. Children and adults under age 55 should receive the MCV4 vaccine. The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations now call for routine vaccination of all adolescents (aged 11 - 18) at the earliest opportunity, ideally at age 11-12. The ACIP also recommends vaccination and booster doses for those previously defined as being at increased risk, including people exposed to single cases or outbreaks; freshmen college students living in dorms; military recruits; travelers to developing countries where outbreaks have occurred; and patients with problems in the spleen.\nMany parents are worried that some vaccines are not safe and may harm their baby or young child. They may ask their doctor or nurse to wait, or even refuse to have the vaccine. However, it is important to think about the risks of not vaccinating, as well.\nSome people believe that the small amount of mercury (called thimerosal) that is a common preservative in multidose vaccines causes autism or ADHD. However, studies have NOT shown this risk to be true.\nThimerosal is a preservative that has been used in many vaccines since the 1930s. (Preservatives are necessary to prevent vaccine contamination with live organism in vials that are used for vaccinating multiple people.) The amount of mercury introduces into vaccines has been very small (approximately 25 micrograms of mercury per 0.5 mL dose, according to the Food and Drug Administration).\nCurrently,, all vaccines recommended for children aged 6 or younger contain either no thimerosal or only trace amounts of it, with the exception of the inactivated influenza vaccine. (A limited supply of this vaccine, containing only trace amounts of thimerosal, is available for use in infants, children, and pregnant women.) A trace amount means that a given dose of vaccine contains less than 1 part per million.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and The Institute of Medicine (IOM) all agree that vaccines or any component of vaccines are not responsible for the number of children who are currently being diagnosed with autism. They conclude that benefits of vaccinations outweigh the risk\nSome parents are also worried that they or their child can get the infection from some vaccines, such as the MMR, the varicella, or the nasal spray flu vaccines. However, unless you have a weakened immune systems, this is very, very unlikely.\nLike many medications, there is always a chance an immunization can cause adverse events.\nOf great concern are anti-immunization organizations and web sites, which were formed mostly because of unsubstantiated reports linking small numbers of serious problems to some vaccines. The following watchdog systems are now in effect to monitor side effects from vaccination:\nVAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) is a government service that registers all adverse events reported after vaccination, including those not related to the vaccine. It is useful for surveillance but has limitations. For example, the service may record the same case more than once. In addition, more serious events that occur soon after a vaccination are more likely to be reported than later and milder events, and such events are not necessarily linked to the vaccine.\nVSD (Vaccine Safety Datalink) is a linked database that analyzes the records of more than 5 million patients each year. It is more accurate than VAERS, although the information it contains is not as timely.\nThe CDC has established the national network of Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Centers. It provides services to physicians to help them evaluate and manage patients who may have had a side effect.\n     Studies using these systems are ongoing and     none     to date have confirmed reports of any significant association between most vaccines and severe side effects that would outweigh the benefits of these important and lifesaving agents.   \nNo vaccine is 100% safe. Allergic and serious reactions are possible. In 2 cases, the early oral live polio vaccine and the first rotavirus vaccine, problems did occur, and some were serious. It is important to note, however, that even in these cases, the vaccines were withdrawn and the severe events were still far fewer than the number of lives saved. Both of these vaccines have been changed and are now safe.\nHowever, deciding not to immunize a child also involves risk. The potential benefits from receiving vaccines far outweigh the potential risks.\nAfter immunizations were introduced on a wide scale, infections such as tetanus, diphtheria, mumps, measles, pertussis (whooping cough), and polio became rare. All of these illnesses used to lead to lifetime disabilities or even death\nNewer immunization have also decreased certain types of meningitis, pneumonia, and ear infections in children.\nPregnant women may contract infections that can be very dangerous to their fetus. Vaccines reduce this risk.\nInfants often accept the first injection easily, since they are not expecting it. It gets more difficult, however, with each additional injection. Simply providing love and warmth can help children of all ages tolerate immunizations.\nAdditional tips:\nDo not lie and tell an older child that an injection will be painless. Some health care providers suggest telling your child that it stings a little, and to count to 5 while the vaccine is being administered.\nAsk the doctor if it is OK to give the child a dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) after a vaccination if pain or fever causes distress. Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or other non-aspirin pain relievers may be acceptable alternatives. (Children should NEVER take aspirin.)\nA cooling spray may work by numbing the skin a little.\nLonger needles, rather than shorter ones, may help reduce pain.\nHave your child take a deep breath right before the injection and blow out very hard while it is being given. One study reported very good results with this breathing technique.\nGive a sweet fluid before the shot and a little reward, such as a lollipop, immediately after the shot. Sugar actually has mild pain relieving properties for infants.\nAlthough severe reactions are extremely rare, parents should know how to respond.\n     Call the doctor immediately if a child has any of the following symptoms     .   \nExtremely High Fever. A rectal temperature of 105 \u00c2\u00b0F or higher. (Temperatures taken under the arm or by mouth often register lower than actual temperatures.)\nInconsolable Crying. The child has been crying for over 3 hours without stopping or has a cry that isn't normal, such as a high-pitched sound.\nConvulsions. The child's body starts shaking, twitching, or jerking. This is usually in response to a high fever. Place the child face down with the head to one side, protecting the head from hitting anything hard. Be sure the child can breathe freely. A simple febrile seizure stops by itself within a few seconds to 10 minutes.\n     Seek immediate medical attention if a child has any of the following symptoms   \nShock. The child collapses, turns pale, and becomes unresponsive.\nSevere Allergic (Anaphylactic) Reaction. Swelling in the mouth and throat, wheezing and breathing difficulties, dizziness. The child collapses or is pale and limp.\n     Call the doctor if the following symptoms persist for more than 24 hours:   \nThe injection site is still red and tender.\nFever does not go down.\nThe child is still fussy.\n     Diphtheria.     Diphtheria is caused by the bacterium     Corynebacterium diphtheriae     , which can occur as either a toxic or nontoxic strain. When only the skin is involved, it is known as cutaneous diphtheria, and is likely to be a nontoxic strain. If the toxic strain affects the mucus linings in the body, such as the throat, diphtheria becomes life threatening. Between 1900 and 1925     ,     diphtheria infected 200,000 people every year and killed between 5 - 10% of them, mostly the very young and very old. Because of immunizations, only 6 cases were reported in the United States between 2000 and 2003, inclusive.   \n     Tetanus.     Tetanus is a disease that causes severe muscular contractions and convulsions. It is caused by a powerful toxin secreted by the bacterium     Clostridium tetani.     The bacterium is anaerobic, which means it lives without oxygen. People become infected by this dangerous bacterium through skin wounds. It is fatal in 15 - 40% of cases. Only 168 cases were reported in the U.S. between 2000 and 2007, inclusive, mostly in adults. One case, however, occurred in a 12-year-old boy whose parents refused to vaccinate him.   \n     Pertussis.     Pertussis (whooping cough) was a very common childhood illness throughout the first half of the 1900s. The disease is very easily spread from one person to another, and it is most severe in babies. Because of immunizations, cases of whooping cough in the U.S reached an all-time low of 1,010 in 1976. The incidence has risen recently, with 25,827 cases reported in 2004, but dropped to 10,454 in 2007, the last year reported by the World Health Organization.   \nThe benefit of the vaccine wears off by adolescence. Therefore, more cases are seen in adults. Such cases may be greatly underreported. The younger a whooping cough patient is, the higher the risk for severe complications, including pneumonia, seizures, and even death. Children younger than 6 months are at particular risk because even with vaccination, their protection is incomplete due to an immature immune system.\n     The Initial Vaccination.     Vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis has been routinely given to children since the 1940s. The standard vaccine now is DTaP. DTaP uses a form of the pertussis component known as acellular pertussis, which consists of a single weakened pertussis toxoid. DTaP is just as effective but has fewer side effects than DTP, the previous vaccine.   \n     The Booster.   \nProtection against diphtheria and tetanus lasts about 10 years. At that point a booster may be given against tetanus and diphtheria (Td). The Td vaccine contains the standard dose against tetanus and a less potent one against diphtheria. It does not contain the pertussis component.\nThe infant pertussis vaccine can start to wear off after about 5 years, and some previously immunized teens and adults can get a mild form of the disease. There are now two pertussis-containing boosters approved for teens and adults.\n     DTaP Schedule in Childhood     . All children younger than 7 years old should receive the DTaP vaccine. In general, the vaccinations are given as follows:   \nInfants receive a series of three vaccinations at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The only reason to delay a vaccination is in infants with suspected neurologic problems until their neurologic situation is clarified. Children with neurological problems that have been corrected can be vaccinated. (This vaccine should be given no later than their first birthday).\nA fourth dose is given between 15 and 18 months. (Infants at higher risk, such as those exposed to an outbreak of pertussis, may be given this vaccine earlier.)\n       A fifth dose is given at 4 - 6 years. This fifth dose now usually includes a vaccine against       H. influenzae       as well.     \nChildren between the ages of 11 and 15 years old should receive a DTaP booster shot.\nIf a child has a moderate or severe current or recent fever-related illness, vaccinations should be postponed until after recovery. Colds or other mild respiratory infections are no cause for delay. Parents should not be unduly concerned if the interval between doses is longer than that recommended. The immunity from any previous vaccinations persists, and the doctor does not have to start a new series from scratch.\n     Recommendations for Adults     . Many people are currently not getting routine boosters.   \nAll adults who have been fully vaccinated either as a child or an adult should have a Td booster at least every 10 years. If they had not received a DTaP vaccination after age 19, they will need it for the next booster, but not afterwards.\nAdults who have not previously been immunized to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis at any age:\nShould receive a series of three doses. 1 may be the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine.\nIf pregnant, a woman should receive the Td vaccine in the second or third trimester.\nPreviously vaccinated pregnant women should have a DTaP booster immediately after delivery.\nAny patient who requires medical care for any wound may be a candidate for a tetanus vaccine. Wounds that put patients at highest risk for tetanus are puncture wounds or wounds contaminated with dirt or feces. Some considerations for tetanus vaccinations in wounded people are as follows:\nA booster is needed if the last dose was given 5 or more years before the injury.\nChildren under 7 are usually given DTaP if they are not fully vaccinated.\nPatients who have not completed their primary series of tetanus immunizations and people who had experienced an allergic response to a previous tetanus booster may be given tetanus immune globulin (TIG).\n     Allergic Reactions.     In rare cases, people may be allergic to the older diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine, DTP. Parents should tell their doctor if their children have any allergies. The newer vaccine, DTaP, may pose a slightly higher risk for an allergic reaction than the older vaccine, DTP. Children who have severe responses should not be given further vaccinations. A rash that occurs after a dose of DTP is of little consequence. In fact, it does not usually indicate an allergic response but only a temporary immune reaction and does not usually recur with subsequent shots. It should be noted that no deaths have been reported from allergic reactions, even severe (anaphylactic) ones, to the DTP vaccine.   \n     Pain and Swelling at the Injection Site.     Children may feel pain at the injection site. In some cases, a small lump may remain at the site for several weeks. Placing a clean, cool washcloth over any swollen, hot, or red area can help. Children should not be covered or wrapped tightly in clothes or blankets.   \nThe risk for swelling, including of the whole arm or leg, increases with subsequent injections, particularly the fourth and fifth doses. If possible, parents should request that their children receive the same vaccine brand each time to help reduce the risk of side effects.\n     Fever and Other Symptoms.     A child may develop a mild fever, irritability, drowsiness, and loss of appetite after a shot.   \nThe following remedies may be helpful:\nAcetaminophen (for example, Children's Tylenol) and a sponge bath in lukewarm -- NOT cold -- water may help relieve fever and pain.\nThe doctor may suggest that children who have had previous high fevers or other reactions to the injection be given acetaminophen at the time of the vaccination and every 4 hours afterward for 24 hours. (The doctor will determine the dosage according to the weight of the child.)\nChildren should NEVER be given aspirin.\nFevers that should cause concern include the following:\nAny very high fever (over 105 \u00c2\u00b0F) that causes seizures in children should be reported immediately to the doctor. The newer DTaP vaccine has significantly reduced the risk for this side effect when compared to older vaccinations. Although frightening, such fever-related seizures are uncommon and rarely have long-term effects. A recurrence after a subsequent vaccination is very unlikely.\nA new fever that develops 24 hours after the vaccination, or a fever that persists for longer than 24 hours are most likely due to other causes and not the vaccination. This is true also for seizures that develop after 24 hours.\n     Hypotonic-Hyporesponsive Episode (HHE).     HHE is an uncommon response to the pertussis component and occurs within 48 hours of the injection in children under 2. The child usually starts out feverish and irritable and then becomes pale, limp, and unresponsive. Breathing is shallow, and the child's skin may turn bluish. The reaction lasts an average of 6 hours and, although it is frightening, virtually all children return to normal. This side effect is less common since the introduction of the DTaP vaccine, but it can still occur.   \n     Neurologic Effects in Pertussis Component.     Of concern have been a few reports of permanent neurologic abnormalities that have occurred after children have been vaccinated. Such reports include attention deficit disorder, learning disorders, autism, brain damage (encephalopathy), and even death.   \nIt is well established that the diphtheria and tetanus components cause no adverse neurologic effects, so some people suspect the pertussis component. However, many major studies found no causal relationship between neurologic problems and the pertussis vaccination. Studies on the newer DTaP have reported no safety concerns to date.\nStudies suggest that in cases where neurological problems have been strongly linked to the vaccination, high fevers -- not immunization -- are responsible. Children with known neurological abnormalities may also be at risk for an outbreak of symptoms 2 or 3 days after the vaccination. Such a temporary worsening of their disease rarely poses a danger to the child. Children who have new neurologic events following their vaccination may already have a preexisting but unknown condition, such as epilepsy, which is revealed -- but not caused -- by the vaccine. To date, there is no proof that the pertussis vaccine causes these neurologic events, which, in any case, are so infrequent as to be nearly impossible to evaluate in relationship to any event that preceded them.\n     Important Note:     Unwarranted fears of side effects from vaccinations can be dangerous. In England such fears have caused a significant decline in immunization rates since the 1970s. Outbreaks of whooping cough have occurred as a result, causing a number of deaths and brain damage in many children. Small babies are particularly endangered if they become infected from older unvaccinated children (who usually have a mild disease).   \n     Measles.     Measles, one of the most contagious of all human infections, used to be a very common childhood disease. Most cases resolve without serious complications. In severe cases, however, measles can cause pneumonia, and in about 1 out of 1,000 cases it can lead to encephalitis (inflammation in the brain) or death. The risk for these severe complications is highest in the very young and very old. In pregnant women, measles increases the rates for miscarriage, low birth weight, and birth defects.   \nMeasles outbreaks still occur in the United States, usually among groups of people who do not believe in immunizations or in areas where immunization levels have fallen below the critical level. It is a fairly serious childhood infection that is recognized by the rash (as seen here), Koplik spots (small white spots on red background), red eyes, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and coughing.\nAggressive vaccination programs have reduced the incidence of measles in the U.S., to a low of 43 cases in 2007, most imported from other countries.\n     Mumps.     Mumps is at record lows in the US, with 800 cases reported in 2007. In about 15% of cases, mumps affects the lining of the brain and spinal cord, although this is usually not ultimately harmful. Swelling of the testicles occurs in between 20 - 30% of males who have reached puberty, although sterility is rare. Deafness in one ear occurs in one patient out of 20,000 with mumps.   \n     Rubella (German Measles).     When rubella, commonly known as German measles, infects children or adults, it causes a mild illness that includes a rash, enlarged lymph nodes, and sometimes a fever. If a pregnant woman is infected during her first trimester, however, her baby has a 80% chance for developing birth defects, including heart abnormalities, cataracts, mental retardation, and deafness.   \nBefore the vaccine became available, about 56,000 cases of rubella occurred annually in the U.S. Vaccination programs have dramatically reduced the number of cases to a low of 12 in 2007, but between 6 - 11% of adults are still susceptible, particularly unvaccinated Hispanic Americans who were born outside of the U.S.\nSafe and effective live-virus vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella have been developed over recent decades. They are usually combined in children as the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Individual live-virus vaccines or the combined MMR may be given to adults, depending on their risk factors.\n     Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) Vaccine in Early Childhood.     The combined MMR vaccine should be given in two doses:   \nBetween ages 12 and 15 months for the first dose\nBetween ages 4 and 6 years for the second dose. (Children who receive only one dose at 15 months or older have five times the risk of measles compared to those who had two doses.)\n     Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) Vaccine in Adolescents and Adults.     The general recommendations for adult MMR vaccinations are as follows:   \nMost people born before 1957 have experienced these once-common childhood diseases and do not require vaccination.\nAll unvaccinated people born after 1956 who did not already have measles and mumps should be given two doses, administered at least 1 month apart, (adolescents) or 1 dose (adults) of the live MMR vaccine.\nMany people received an inactivated measles-virus vaccine in the early 1960s or an inactivated mumps-virus vaccine between 1950 and 1978; such people need revaccination with two doses of the live MMR vaccine. (This will cause no harm even if someone had a previous live-virus-mumps vaccination.)\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends the live-virus MMR vaccine for HIV-infected children, teenagers, and young adults, except for those who are severely immunocompromised. The vaccine appears to be safe in HIV-infected children, and it should be stressed that measles is very dangerous in this population.\n     Rubella Vaccinations During Pregnancy.     It is particularly important for any unvaccinated nonpregnant woman who wants children to be vaccinated against rubella. It is recommended that women wait at least 28 days after vaccination to start trying to conceive. Except under very special circumstances, no live-virus vaccine, especially MMR, is given to an already pregnant woman, since there is a theoretical risk for birth defects from these vaccines. Fortunately, the risk is low. In fact, studies have reported no increase in birth defects in women who were inadvertently vaccinated for rubella early in their pregnancy.   \nCommon side effects from the MMR vaccination include fever, rash, and joint pain. Most of these side effects are less frequent after the second dose; however, teens and adults who receive this vaccine are more likely to suffer from joint pain and stiffness.\n     Fever.     About 5 - 15% of people who are vaccinated with any live measles virus vaccine develop a fever of 103 \u00c2\u00b0F or greater, usually between 5 and 15 days after the vaccination. It usually lasts 1 or 2 days but can persist up to 5 days. In very young children, seizures can occur from high fever 8 - 14 days after vaccination, but they are rare and almost never have any long-term effects.   \n     Swollen Glands.     The live-mumps vaccine can cause mild swelling in the glands that are situated near the ears.   \n     Joint Pain.     Up to 25% of women have joint pain 1 - 3 weeks after a vaccination with a live-rubella virus; it lasts for 1 day to 3 weeks. Such pain does not usually interrupt daily activities. Rarely, it recurs or becomes persistent.   \n     Allergic Reaction.     People who have known anaphylactic allergies (very severe reactions) to eggs or neomycin are at high risk for a severe allergic response to the MMR vaccine. People with allergies that do not cause anaphylactic shock to these substances are not at higher risk for a serious allergic reaction to the vaccine. Mild allergic reactions, including rash and itching, may occur in some people. A rash occurs in about 5% of people who are vaccinated with a live-measles vaccine. A live-mumps vaccination has caused rash and itching, but these symptoms are usually mild.   \n     Interaction with Tuberculosis Test.     The live-measles vaccine may interfere with a tuberculosis test, so the two should be administered at least 4 - 6 weeks apart. No evidence exists that the vaccine has an adverse effect on tuberculosis itself.   \n     Mild Infection.     A mild form of measles that has no symptoms may develop in previously immunized people who are exposed to the virus, although this mild infection may not be significant.   \n     Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP).     In about 1 in 22,300 doses, MMR can cause a rare bleeding disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This can cause a purple, bruise-like discoloration that can spread across the body, nose bleeds, or tiny red spots. It is nearly always mild and temporary. (Of note, the risk for ITP is much higher with the actual infections, particularly rubella.)   \nNote: Much controversy has arisen over unsubstantiated reports of neurologic side effects attributable to MMR. This is of great concern since such reports have resulted in a decline in immunizations in certain areas, notably affluent areas in England where the vaccination rate has dropped from 92% in 1996 to 84% currently. Here, measles outbreaks are now climbing, and doctors fear that unless immunization rates increase rapidly, case numbers will significantly increase. In these and other regions, some parents mistakenly believe that the dangers of immunization outweigh a dangerous childhood illness that only older people remember. It should be strongly noted that measles still cause about 745,000 deaths in unvaccinated children who live in underdeveloped countries, primarily in Africa.\nMost publicity has centered on a possible link between the MMR vaccine, which was introduced in 1988, and a variant of autism that includes inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and impaired behavioral development. Such findings have been rigorously reviewed and refuted in a number of well-conducted studies.\nDespite considerable publicity, there is no evidence linking MMR vaccination with the development of autism. The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention's web site provides extensive information on this matter. The popular media has incorrectly reported the possible link between autism and MMR as causing a split in the scientific community, but virtually all experts refute any association between the two. In fact, reports of symptoms related to autism increased only after widespread publicity of this supposed side effect.\nThe potential benefits from receiving the MMR vaccine far outweigh the potential adverse effects. Measles, mumps, and rubella are all very serious illnesses and each may have complications resulting in lifetime disabilities or even death. The incidence of such complications, related to having the actual diseases, is far greater than the potential of developing serious, or even moderate, adverse effects due to the MMR vaccine.\nChickenpox (caused by the varicella-zoster virus) is one of the most contagious childhood diseases. Nearly every unvaccinated child becomes infected with it. The affected child or adult may develop hundreds of itchy, fluid-filled blisters that burst and form crusts.\nThe infection rarely causes complications in healthy children, but it is not always harmless. Five out of every 1,000 children are hospitalized and, in rare cases, it can be fatal. Before the vaccination became widespread, chickenpox resulted in about 11,000 hospitalizations and 100 deaths a year.\nThis is a close-up picture of chickenpox. Early chickenpox lesions consist of small red papules that quickly fill with a yellowish or straw colored fluid to form small blisters (vesicles), as seen in this photograph. Later, these vesicles will rupture, forming shallow erosions that crust over and then ultimately heal.\nChickenpox can be especially severe in adults and very serious in anyone with a compromised immune system. In addition, the varicella virus (which persists in the body after the childhood disease is gone) erupts as a painful and distressing condition called herpes zoster (shingles) in about 20% of adults with a history of chickenpox. Chickenpox itself usually occurs only once, although a few cases of mild second infections, marked by the telltale rash, have been reported in older children years after their first infection.\nA live-virus vaccine (Varivax) produces persistent immunity against chickenpox. Data show that the vaccine can prevent chickenpox or reduce the severity of the illness even if it is used within 3 days, and possibly up to 5 days, after exposure to the infection.\n     Recommendations for the Vaccine in Children.     The vaccine against chickenpox is now recommended in the U.S. for all children between the ages of 12 months and adolescence who have not yet had chickenpox. Children are given 2 doses of the vaccine. The first dose is recommended at age 12-15 months. The second dose should be given at 4 - 6 years. However, doses can be as little as 28 days apart (note that the ideal minimum time for children under 13 years is 3 months). To date, more than 75% of children have been vaccinated.   \nDoctors recommend that the chickenpox vaccine be given at the same time as the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine or that there is a delay of at least 1 month between the two vaccinations. (If the chickenpox vaccination is given within that 30-day period -- but not at the same time -- there is a higher risk for a breakthrough infection later on.)\nA chickenpox vaccine is part of the routine immunization schedule. It is about 100% effective against moderate or severe illness, and 85 - 90% effective against mild chickenpox in children. Parents often express concern that the immunity from the vaccine might not last. The chickenpox vaccine, though, is the only routine vaccine that does not require a booster.\n     Recommendations for the Vaccine in Adults.   \nHealthy adults without a known history of chickenpox, and who do not show immunity through testing, should receive 2 doses of the vaccine. Special attention should be given to the following groups:\nOlder people without a history of chickenpox and who are at high risk of exposure or transmission (such as hospital or day care workers and parents of young children)\nPeople who live or work in environments in which viral transmission is likely\nNonpregnant women of childbearing age\nAdolescents and adults living in households with children\nInternational travelers\nAs with other live-virus vaccines, the chickenpox vaccine is not recommended for the following people:\nPregnant women (including the 3 months prior to pregnancy).\nPeople whose immune systems are compromised by disease or drugs (such as after organ transplantation). The vaccine is being studied, however, for its safety in some of these patients, particularly children with cancer or other high-risk conditions. An inactivated varicella vaccine may be safe and effective in patients undergoing bone marrow transplants, when given before and after the operation.\nMost patients who cannot be vaccinated but are exposed to chickenpox are given immune globulin antibodies against the varicella virus. This helps prevent complications of the disease if they become infected.\n     Discomfort at the Injection Site.     About 20% of vaccine recipients have pain, swelling, or redness at the injection site.   \n     Mild Rash and Risk of Transmission.     The vaccine may produce a mild rash within about a month of the vaccination, which has been known to transmit chickenpox to others. Individuals who have recently been vaccinated should avoid close contact with anyone who might be susceptible to severe complications from chickenpox, until the risk for a rash has passed.   \n     Severe Side Effects.     Between 1995 and 2001, 759 serious adverse effects were reported. Such events included seizures, pneumonia, anaphylactic reaction, encephalitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, neuropathy, herpes zoster, and blood abnormalities. Anecdotal reports have found a higher association of side effects when varicella vaccine is given at the same time as the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination. Because combined vaccinations are being developed, such effects should be closely studied.   \nThere is intense debate over the long-term protection of the vaccine. However, any negative studies to date on long-term effectiveness simply raise the question of the need for booster or higher doses -- not the elimination of the vaccine altogether.\n     Long-Term Protection in Vaccinated Children.     Most studies suggest that the vaccine is not wholly effective in up to 30% of vaccinated children. However, they also report if chickenpox occurs, more than 95% of the cases are mild. It is also usually less contagious. In such people, the infection appears to be caused by a wild virus, not a reactivation of the vaccine. The longer the interval since vaccination occurs, the higher the risk for a breakthrough infection.   \n     Long-Term Protection in Vaccinated Adults.     The protective effects for adults are even less clear.   \n     Vaccine's Effect on Shingles.     A primary concern is whether the vaccine protects against shingles later on, particularly in people who have breakthrough infections -- however mild. As more and more children get vaccinated, the actual protection of the vaccine and the implication of the breakthrough infection will become clearer.   \nIn September 2005, the Food and Drug Administration approved a combination vaccine to protect against measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox. ProQuad, produced by Merck & Co., protects against all four infections with one injection. ProQuad is approved for use in children from 12 months to 12 years of age. However, due to manufacturing problems, the vaccine is in limited supply at the time this report goes to print. Merck & Co. expects the vaccine to return to full supply levels in the first half of 2010.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that children receiving ProQuad are at higher risk of developing febrile seizures, compared to children receiving the MMR and varicella vaccines separately.\nShingles is an infection caused by the varicella zoster virus, the same virus responsible for chickenpox. Once a person has chickenpox, the virus lies dormant in the body. It can emerge years later as shingles.\nShingles causes a painful, red, and sometimes blistery rash to form on the body or face. The disease can cause intense pain, called post herpetic neuralgia. Other symptoms include fever, headache, and chills. In rare cases, complications, such as pneumonia, blindness, and brain inflammation (encephalitis), can occur. Shingles is most common in adults over age 50.\nIn May 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration licensed the herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax) for the prevention of shingles. The vaccine can reportedly cut the incidence of shingles in half for adults over age 60, but its effectiveness declines with increasing age.\n     Recommendations for the Vaccine in Adults     . Most adults age 60 or older should get a single dose of the herpes zoster vaccine, regardless of whether they have previously had shingles.   \nThe following people should not receive the herpes zoster vaccine:\nAnyone who has a weakened immune system due to HIV\/AIDS or cancer of the lymph, bone, or blood, or due to treatments such as radiation or long-term corticosteroids\nWomen who are pregnant, or anyone who is in close contact with a pregnant woman who has not had chickenpox\nChildren -- they should receive only the chickenpox vaccine\n     Redness, pain, and swelling     . About a third of the people who get the vaccine have mild redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the injection site.   \n     Headache     . About 1 in 70 people experience headache after receiving the vaccine.   \nThere have been no serious side effects reported with the shingles vaccine.\nResearch has found that the herpes zoster vaccine reduces the incidence of shingles by about 50%. The benefit is as high as 64% in people ages 60 - 69, but declines to 18% in the group of adults older than 80 years. In people who are vaccinated but still develop shingles, the vaccine reduces the duration of the pain involved with the disease.\nThe hepatitis A virus infected an estimated 56,000 people in 2004. Hepatitis A, formerly called infectious hepatitis, is always acute and never becomes chronic. The virus is excreted in feces and transmitted by contaminated food and water. Eating shellfish taken from sewage-contaminated water is a common means of contracting hepatitis A. It can also be acquired by close contact with individuals infected with the virus. It is estimated that 11 - 16% of reported cases occur among children or employees in daycare centers or among their contacts. The hepatitis A virus does not directly kill liver cells, and experts do not yet know how the virus actually injures the liver.\nA fly may act as a mechanical vector of diseases such as hepatitis A. The fly may carry the infective organism on its feet or mouth parts and contaminate food or water, which a person then consumes. A biological vector actually develops an infective organism in its body and passes it along to its host, usually through its saliva. A fly can be a biological vector, as in the transmission of leishmaniasis by the sandfly.\nAll children should get 2 doses of the hepatitis A vaccine starting at 1 year, according to CDC recommendations. The doses should be given at least 6 months apart. Others who should be vaccinated against hepatitis A include travelers to developing countries, people living in communities where outbreaks occur, people with blood-clotting disorders, sexually active homosexual men, and health care workers exposed to the virus. People with chronic liver disease, including those with hepatitis C, should also be vaccinated, particularly if they have not been exposed to hepatitis A, since the infection can cause liver failure in these patients.\nThe hepatitis A vaccine can be given along with immune globulin and other vaccines. Individuals should also receive immune globulin if they are exposed within 4 weeks of the vaccination. A combined vaccine against both hepatitis A and B is now available as well, for those at high risk for both these infections. People should get 3 doses of this vaccine, and the last dose should be given 6 months after the first dose.\n     Side Effects.     The vaccine is very safe and effective, although allergies can occur. The most common side effects reported are soreness at the injection site, headache, and general malaise.   \nAbout 2 billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) worldwide, and each year 1 million people die, mostly due to cirrhosis and liver cancers that develop in the chronic form of this disease. In the U.S., about 1.25 million people have chronic hepatitis B.\nHepatitis B is also known as serum hepatitis. It spreads through blood and sexual contact. The infection is seen with increased frequency among intravenous drug users who share needles and among the homosexual population. This photograph is an electronmicroscopic image of hepatitis B virus particles. (Courtesy of the CDC.)\nPregnant women with hepatitis B can transmit the virus to their babies. Even if they are not infected at birth, unvaccinated children of infected mothers run a 60% risk of developing hepatitis B before age 5. Although hepatitis B infections have dropped 95% since routine immunization began in the early 1990s, there are still children who aren't immunized, and the disease persists. Universal vaccination against this disease during childhood is very important.\nSeveral inactivated virus vaccines, including Recombivax HB, GenHevac B, Hepagene, and Engerix-B, can prevent hepatitis B. Twinrix is a vaccine against both hepatitis A and B. These vaccines are safe, even for infants and children. Vaccination programs are proving to reduce the risk for liver cancer.\n     Hepatitis B Vaccine for Early Childhood.     Experts now recommend that all infants and children not previously vaccinated be immunized by the time they reach seventh grade. Typical schedules for hepatitis B vaccinations in childhood are as follows:   \nAll infants should receive the hepatitis B vaccine soon after birth and before hospital discharge. (The first dose may be delayed if the mother has no evidence of infection, but only with the doctor's permission.) The second dose should be given at 1 - 2 months; and the third between 6 and 18 months (at least 16 weeks after first dose and 8 weeks after second dose). (A fourth dose may also be given if any of the previous doses was a combination vaccine.) This is a safe vaccine, even in newborns, and parents should be sure their infants are immunized.\nInfants of mothers infected with hepatitis B should be treated with immune globulin plus the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. The second dose should be given at 1 - 2 months and the third at 6 months. Infants born to infected mothers should be tested for antibody status at 9 - 18 months to see if they are chronic virus carriers or need to be revaccinated. Immunization rates are still too low in this group.\nWhen it is not known if a mother is infected, the infant should receive the vaccine within 12 hours of birth. The mother's blood should then be tested right away. If she is infected, the infant should receive immune globulins within 1 week of birth.\nChildren who are 11 - 12 and who have not been immunized should receive 2 or 3 doses of the vaccine (depending on the brand) given over a few months.\nHepatitis B vaccine protection may wane over time. According to a 2007 study, 40% of adolescents who had received a first dose of the vaccine as newborns had declining immunity to the disease by age 14. As of now, routine booster shots are not recommended because more research is needed on the subject. Booster shots may be recommended for those at risk, such as from sexual exposure.\n     Hepatitis B Vaccine for Adults.     The following adults are at very high risk and should be vaccinated:   \nHealth care and public safety workers who may be exposed to blood products. Such individuals have a risk for hepatitis B that ranges from 15 - 30%.\nPeople in the same household as hepatitis B-infected individuals. (Unvaccinated people who have had intimate exposure to people with hepatitis B may be protected with immune globulin, which is sometimes administered with the vaccine.)\nTravelers to countries with a high incidence of hepatitis B infection.\nPatients who require transfusions and have not been infected with hepatitis B. (Those with blood clotting disorders should have the vaccination administered under the skin, not injected in the muscle.)\nSexually active individuals with multiple partners.\nPeople with any sexually transmitted diseases.\nOther people at risk who would benefit from vaccinations include:\nPatients and workers in mental institutions\nPatients undergoing hemodialysis (these people may need larger doses or boosters; they also may need to be revaccinated if blood tests indicate they are losing immunity)\nPeople who use injected drugs\nPregnant women at risk for the virus (there is no evidence that the vaccine is dangerous to the fetus)\nPeople receiving treatments or who have conditions that suppress the immune system may need the vaccination, although its benefits for this group are unclear except for those at high risk, such as people with HIV or spleen abnormalities.\nThe regimen in adults is typically 3 doses given over 6 months. One study reported that older adults would benefit from a fourth dose without incurring serious side effects. People who abuse alcohol may need higher doses.\nA small percentage of people do not develop immunity, even after a vaccine has been given repeatedly. A more potent vaccine is proving to be effective for these people; it loses its effect after 5 years in about one-third of those who receive it.\n     Soreness.     Soreness at the injection site is the most common side effect.   \n     Nerve Inflammation.     There have been reports of nerve inflammation after vaccinations for hepatitis B, and some questions about multiple sclerosis. However, studies and reviews have found no real evidence linking the vaccine to a number of disorders.   \n     Due to even the small theoretical risk of nerve damage in infants, some groups oppose the vaccination in children who are not in high-risk groups. However, this risk must be balanced against the significant reduction in chronic hepatitis and liver cancer cases due to this vaccine, especially around the world.    \nThe pneumococcal bacterium (also called Streptococcus pneumoniae or S. pneumoniae) is responsible for many respiratory infections in the upper and lower airways. This bacterium is dangerous for people with serious underlying chronic medical conditions and illnesses, and is the leading cause of ear infections and sinusitis in children. The most common type of severe S. pneumoniae infection is pneumonia.\nThis picture shows the organism pneumococci. These bacteria are usually paired (diplococci) or appear in chains. Pneumococci are typically associated with pneumonia, but may cause infection in other organs, such as the brain (pneumococcal meningitis) and bloodstream (pneumococcal septicemia). (Courtesy of the CDC.)\n     The pneumococcal vaccine protects against some strains of     S. pneumoniae     bacteria, the most common cause of respiratory infections. There are 2 effective vaccines available:   \nThe 7-valent (strain) pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevnar (PCV7) for all infants and children below five years of age.\nThe 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax, Pnu-Immune) or PPSV23 for some adults and older children.\n     The 7-valent conjugate vaccine Prevnar (PCV7     ) is very effective in children. The vaccine has reduced hospital admissions for pneumonia in children under age 2 by up to 40 %. The vaccine has even lowered hospital admissions among adults aged 18 - 39, likely because they are parents of young children who might otherwise have been exposed to the disease. Recurrent ear infections in children have fallen by 28% since the introduction of the vaccine.   \nThe recommended schedule of immunization for Prevnar (PCV7) is 4 doses, given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 - 15 months of age. Infants starting immunization between 7 and 11 months should have 3 doses. Children starting their vaccinations between 12 and 23 months only need 2 doses. Those who are over 2 years old need only 1 dose.\nThe 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine or PPV is recommended for the following older children or adults:\nAnyone older than two years of age with heart disease, lung disease (including asthma), kidney disease or on dialysis; alcoholics, people with diabetes, cirrhosis, or those with cochlear implants or leaks of cerebrospinal fluid.\nAll people over 65 years old; some experts believe that all adults aged 50 - 64 should also be vaccinated. Adults over 65 who received a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine before they were 65 should receive a second dose after they turn 65.\nAdults aged 19 - 64 who smoke should receive a single dose of PPV.\nThose with sickle cell disease\nThose with a nonworking spleen and those who have had their spleen removed (should receive a second vaccine five years or more after the first dose)\nPersons with conditions that weaken the immune system, such as cancer, HIV infection, or organ transplantation\nPersons who receive chronic (long-term) immunosuppressive medications, including steroids\nIndividuals with immune deficiencies or those undergoing treatments that suppress the immune system (should receive a second vaccine five years or more after the first dose)\nPatients with autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, although protection may not be as strong for these patients.\nOlder people who have had transplant operations or those with kidney disease may require a revaccination after 6 years.\nPeople living in long-term care facilities.\nAlaska Natives or American Indians over age 50 who live in areas with high rates of invasive pneumococcal disease.\nThe safety of the pneumococcal vaccine hasn't been proven during the first trimester of pregnancy; however, there have been no adverse effects reported. When the vaccine is administered to pregnant women, it may actually protect their infants against certain respiratory infections.\nProtection lasts for more than 6 years in most people, although the protective value may be lost at a faster rate in elderly people than in younger adults. Anyone at risk for serious pneumonia should be revaccinated 6 years after the first dose, including those who were vaccinated before age 65. Subsequent booster doses, however, are not recommended.\nSide effects include pain and redness at the injection site, fever, and joint aches. Children are more likely to have fever within 48 hours if they receive other vaccines at the same time, and also after the second dose. Fortunately, severe reactions are very rare, even if a person is mistakenly revaccinated before the effects of the first vaccination have worn off. Allergic reactions are also very rare.\nPoliomyelitis, more commonly known as polio, is a disorder caused by a virus and marked by potentially paralyzing nerve-related damage, which can be fatal. Fifty years ago it was a major killer of children, and it remains a threat in parts of Asia and Africa today. Vaccination programs eliminated the disease in the Americas in 1994, with the last case of wild poliovirus in the U.S. reported in 1979. As of 2004, polio has been eradicated in the Americas, the Western Pacific, and Europe.\nPoliomyelitis is a communicable disease caused by viral infection and occurs through direct contact with infected secretions. Polio is found worldwide, but immunization has reduced the incidence. Clinical polio affects the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Disability is more common than death.\nTwo poliovirus vaccines have been available in the U.S.: oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), a live-virus vaccine, and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), a killed vaccine that is administered by an injection. Both produce immunity in more than 95% of people. The live-virus used in the vaccine, however, has in some cases, reverted to a form that can cause polio in unvaccinated people. This is a particular danger in developing countries where vaccination rates are low. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends only the inactivated IPV vaccine for children. The schedule is 4 doses of IPV at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 - 18 months, and 4 - 6 years.\n     Poliovirus Vaccine in Older Children and Adults.     The poliovirus vaccine is not usually recommended for people over 18. Exceptions are unvaccinated health care workers, laboratory technicians, or others exposed to polioviruses. Travelers to developing countries where outbreaks of poliovirus have been reported should be vaccinated. Adults who need protection should also be given the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV).   \n     Allergic Reactions.     The inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) contains small amounts of streptomycin and neomycin, so people allergic to these antibiotics can also have an allergic response to this vaccine. Patients should report any allergies to their physician.   \n     Paralysis.     Rare cases of paralysis have occurred in people taking the oral live poliovirus vaccine or in those exposed to recipients of this vaccine. It should be stressed the risk is very small, with only 1 case occurring out of 2.4 million doses. Since the introduction of the current recommended series that uses only IPV, no cases have been reported.   \n     Contamination by Simian Virus 40.     The public was alarmed by reports of contamination of polio vaccines given between 1955 and 1963 by a virus known as SV40. The virus has been detected in certain rare cancers, including mesothelioma (a lung cancer normally associated with asbestos exposure), osteosarcoma, some brain tumors, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.   \nStill, about 98 million people may have been exposed, and most of these cancers are very rare (although some, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, are increasing). At least 40 years of observation have raised no red flags that indicate any serious problem. However, polio, once a major killer of children, has nearly been wiped out worldwide.\nInfluenza, commonly called the flu, is always caused by a virus.\nInfluenza, also known as the flu, is caused by a virus.\nThere are different strains of influenza:\nInfluenza A is the most widespread and most severe strain. It can affect both animals and humans. Influenza A is the cause of all the worldwide epidemics (pandemics) of the flu that have occurred,. More than 200,000 hospitalizations per year in the U.S. are due to this strain of the flu. (The number refers only to hospitalizations due to seasonal flu, not those from the new H1N1 \"swine\" flu.)\nInfluenza B infects only humans. It is less common than type A, but is often associated with specific outbreaks, such as in nursing homes. Flu caused by this strain tends to be milder than that caused by Influenza A.\nThe current H1N1 \"Swine Flu\" pandemic is a new strain of influenza A.\n     Complications of the Flu.     Pneumonia is the major serious complication of the flu and can be very serious. It can develop about 5 days after viral influenza. It is an uncommon event, however. It nearly always occurs in high-risk individuals, such as the very young or very old, pregnant women, and hospitalized or immunocompromised patients.   \nThe largest number of H1N1 flu cases have occurred in people ages 5 - 24. Fewer cases and deaths have been reported in people older than age 64. This is a different pattern and seen with the seasonal or regular flu outbreaks.\n     Description of Vaccines.     The influenza vaccine is designed to provoke the immune system to attack antigens on the surface of the virus. (Antigens are molecules that the immune system recognizes as alien and targets for attack.)   \nUnfortunately, the antigens in influenza viruses undergo genetic alterations (called antigenic drift) over time, so they are likely to become resistant to a vaccine that worked in the previous year. Vaccines are redesigned annually to match the current strain.\nA vaccine for the new H1N1 (swine flu) strain was released in the Fall of 2009. This vaccine does not take the place of the seasonal flu vaccine, nor will the seasonal flu vaccine protect against this new strain.\nDue to the urgency of the H1N1 situation, and the late emergence of the virus in the spring of 2009, manufacturers of the seasonal flu vaccine shifted their efforts to manufacturing the H1N1 vaccine. As a result, supplies of both seasonal and H1N1 vaccines are limited as this report goes to print.\nThere are two types flu vaccines for both the regular flu and the H1N1 (\"swine\") flu. One is given as an injection, the other is a nasal spray.\nThe flu injection contains killed (inactive) viruses. It is not possible to get the flu from this type of vaccine. The flu injection is approved for people age 6 months and older. A preservative-free vaccine (Fluzone) is also available.\nThe Nasal spray flu vaccines use a live, weakened virus instead of a dead one.\nIt is engineered to multiply in the cool temperatures of the nasal passages, but not in the warmer lungs and lower airways. Its presence in the nasal passages boosts the specific immune factors in the mucous membranes that fight off the epidemic flu viruses.\nIt is approved for healthy people ages 2 - 49, who are not pregnant. It should NOT be used in those who have asthma or in children under age 5 who have repeated wheezing episodes.\nThe avian flu vaccine is designed for people aged 18 - 64 who are at risk for exposure to the avian H5N1 virus. The vaccine is given as 2 doses, spaced about 1 month apart. In studies, the vaccine appeared to be effective and well tolerated. Currently, the government is stockpiling the vaccination in case of an avian influenza outbreak. The vaccine is not available to the general public.\nIdeally, appropriate candidates should be vaccinated every October or November. However, it may take longer for a full supply of the vaccine to reach certain locations. In such cases, the high-risk groups should be served first.\nAntibodies to the flu virus usually develop within 2 weeks of vaccination, and immunity peaks within 4 - 6 weeks, then gradually wanes.\nChildren younger than 9 years of age, who have not been previously vaccinated or received only 1 dose the previous year should be given 2 vaccine doses, spaced 4 weeks apart.\nIt should be noted that if an individual develops flu symptoms and is accurately diagnosed in time, vaccination of the other members of the household within 36 - 48 hours affords effective protection to those individuals, according to a 2004 Canadian analysis of multiple studies.\nIn healthy adults, immunization typically reduces the chance of getting the seasonal flu by about 70 - 90%. The current flu vaccines may be slightly less effective in certain patients, such as the elderly and those with certain chronic diseases. Some evidence suggests, however, that even in people with a weaker response, the vaccine is usually protective against serious flu complications, particularly pneumonia. Some evidence suggests that among the elderly, a flu shot may help protect against stroke, adverse heart events, and death from all causes.\nBecause the H1N1 (swine) flu vaccine is so new, there is not a lot of data about its effectiveness to prevent this strain of the flu. However, studies of the vaccine before it was released showed that people formed antibodies to the H1N1 flu in a similar manner to the regular or seasonal flu.\n     The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the CDC recommend regular or seasonal flu vaccinations for     all     healthy children ages 6 months to 18 years (inclusive).   \nThe following, in order of priority, are the adult population groups who should be vaccinated with the regular or seasonal flu vaccine each year. Any person not mentioned in these categories below is still encouraged to get the vaccine if they wish to avoid the flu. The first 2 groups below have the highest need for flu vaccinations and are given top priority:\nPeople at risk for more serious flu infections include those who:\nAre 50 or more years of age\nAre 6 to 49 months of age\nHave chronic lung disease, including asthma and COPD, or heart disease\nAre 18 years old or younger AND taking long-term aspirin therapy\nHave sickle cell anemia or other hemoglobin-related disorders\nHave kidney disease, anemia, diabetes, or chronic liver disease\nHave a weakened immune system (including those with cancer or HIV\/AIDS)\nReceive long-term treatment with steroids for any condition\nAre pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the flu season. Women who are pregnant should receive only the inactivated flu vaccine. (Vaccinations should usually be given after the first trimester. Exceptions may be women who are in their first trimester during flu season, because their risk from complications of the flu is higher than any theoretical risk to the baby from the vaccine)\nThe following people SHOULD get a flu vaccine every year:\nHealth care workers\nAny child or adult who has a higher risk for serious illness (list above)\nChildren between the ages of 6 months and 18 years, with special focus on children from 6 months to 4 years (6 to 49 months).\nHousehold contacts and caregivers of children or adults with high-risk conditions (Breast-feeding women may receive the vaccine.)\nResidents of extended care facilities\nThe flu shot is encouraged for:\nPeople who have in-home contact with children who are younger than 5 years old\nPeople who provide essential community services, such as firemen or police\nPeople living in dormitories or other crowded conditions\nAny adult ages 18 - 50 who wants to reduce their chance of getting influenza\nPriority groups for the H1N1 Vaccine:\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), these high-risk groups should receive the vaccine as soon as it is available:\nPregnant women\nPeople who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age\nHealth care and emergency services personnel who have direct contact with patients or with infectious substances\nPeople between the ages of 6 months and 24 years of age\nPeople from ages 25 through 64 years who are at higher risk for complications from an H1N1 infection\nChildren 6 months through 4 years of age\nChildren ages 5 - 18 who are at greater risk for complications of influenza\nHowever, anyone who wants to reduce their risk of the flu should get the H1N1 flu vaccine. Even if you have had a flu-like illness already, you should still get this vaccine.\nPossible side effects of the flu vaccine include:\nAllergic Reaction. Newer vaccines contain very little egg protein, but an allergic reaction still may occur in people with strong allergies to eggs.\nSoreness at the Injection Site. Up to two-thirds of people who receive the influenza vaccine develop redness or soreness at the injection site for 1 or 2 days afterward.\n       Flu-like Symptoms. Some people actually experience flu-like symptoms, called oculorespiratory syndrome, which include conjunctivitis, cough, wheeze, tightness in the chest, sore throat, or a combination. Such symptoms tend to occur 2 - 24 hours after the vaccination and generally last for up to 2 days. It should be noted that these symptoms are       not       the flu itself but an immune response to the virus proteins in the vaccine. (Anyone with a fever at the time the vaccination is scheduled, however, should wait to be immunized until the ailment has subsided.)     \nGuillain-Barre Syndrome. Isolated cases of a paralytic illness known as Guillain-Barre syndrome have occurred, but if there is any higher risk following the flu vaccine, it is very small (one additional case per 1 million people), and does not outweigh the benefits of the vaccine.\n     Haemophilus influenzae     (     H. influenzae     ) type b is a bacterium, which, despite its name, is entirely different from the viruses that cause influenza (the flu). Before vaccination,     H. influenzae     type b (Hib) was the most common cause of childhood bacterial meningitis, killing 600 American children every year and leaving others deaf, mentally retarded, or epileptic. It is rarely troublesome for adults, although it can be dangerous for anyone with chronic lung disease and those susceptible to infections.   \nThis is a Gram stain of spinal fluid from a person with meningitis. The rod-like organisms seen in the fluid are Haemophilus influenza, one of the most common causes of childhood meningitis (prior to the widespread use of the H. influenza vaccine). The large red-colored objects are cells in the spinal fluid. A vaccine to prevent infection by Haemophilus influenza type B is available as one of the routine childhood immunizations (Hib), typically given at 2, 4, and 12 months.\n     Two equally effective inactivated bacterial vaccines (commonly called Hib vaccines) are available for     H. influenzae     type b. All children under 5 should be vaccinated against     this bacterium     . The vaccine is administered as an injection at 2 and 4 months. Depending on the vaccination preparation, a third shot in the series is administered at 6 months. A booster is required at some time between 12 and 15 months of age.   \nThe Hib vaccine may benefit older people who have had their spleen removed or have illnesses that put them at risk for pneumonia, including sickle cell disease, leukemia, and HIV infection.\nSide effects of the Hib vaccine include redness and pain at the injection site, moderate fever, and, in rare cases, weakness, nausea, and dizziness.\nHPV is actually a group of 100 viruses, about 40 of which are sexually transmitted. Some HPV viruses can significantly increase the risks of cervical cancer, as well as cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and penis. HPV is very common; an estimated 20 million people in the U.S. have it. At least half of all sexually active men and women will eventually be exposed the virus.\nTwo vaccines have been approved and are now recommended for the prevention of some types of HPV.\nThe Gardasil vaccine is 100% effective against cervical, vaginal, and vulvar diseases caused by 4 types of HPV (HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18). Of note, Gardasil prevents cervical cancer caused by HPV strains 16 and 18, which account for 70% of cervical cancer cases in the United States. It is less effective in women who were exposed to the virus before they were vaccinated. The vaccine has been shown to be effective for 5 years after women receive the initial dose. In September 2008, the FDA also approved Gardasil for the prevention of vaginal and valvular cancers caused by HPV 16 and 18.\nA new vaccine, Cervarix, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on October 16 2009. This vaccine protects against HPV strains 16 and 18. As such, it will not prevent genital warts but would still protect against the strains that cause the majority of cervical cancers.\nCurrently, two vaccines are approved by the FDA to prevent either human papillomavirus (HPV) or cervical cancer: Gardasil and Cervarix.\nGardasil is approved for:\nGirls and women ages 9-26, for the protection against HPV-16 and HPV-18, the HPV strains that cause most cases of cervical cancer, and against HPV-6 and HPV-11, which cause 90% of cases of genital warts.\nBoys and young men ages 9 - 26 years to prevent genital warts\nCervarix\nGirls and women ages 10 - 26 for protection against HPV-16 and HPV-18, the HPV strains that cause most cases of cervical cancer.\nCervarix does not protect against genital warts.\nCervarix has not been approved for use in boys or men.\nCurrent immunization guidelines recommend:\nRoutine vaccination for girls ages 11 - 12 years, before they are sexually active. The vaccine should be administered in 3 doses, with the second and third doses administered 2 and 6 months after the first dose. The HPV vaccine can be given at the same time as other vaccines. Either Gardasil or Cervarix may be used, and one vaccine can be substituted for another in the 3-dose series.\nGirls as young as age 9 can receive the vaccine at their doctor's discretion.\nGirls and women ages 13 - 26 who have not been previously immunized or who have not completed the full vaccine series should get vaccinated to catch up on missed doses. The American Cancer Society suggests that women ages 19 - 26 discuss with their doctors the relative risks and benefits of vaccination.\nWomen should not get the vaccine during pregnancy.\nGardasil can be used in boys aged 9 - 18 years to prevent genital warts. At this time, however, the CDC's immunization advisory committee does not recommend its routine use in boys. Rather, the committee is allowing individual physicians to decide whether to vaccinate their male patients.\nCurrently there is no research to confirm the vaccine's effectiveness in women over 26, so there is no recommendation yet for this age group. Gardasil is not recommended for pregnant women.\nStudies have shown no significant side effects from the HPV vaccine. The most common side effect was soreness at the injection site.\nRotavirus is the most common cause of diarrhea, cramps, and vomiting in infants, and affects about 3.5 million children in the U.S. each year. As many as 80% of young children become infected with the virus. Although most cases in this country are mild, more than 50,000 American children are hospitalized and as many as 125 die from severe diarrhea every year. Worldwide the virus can be devastating, causing more than 600,000 infant deaths annually. There is also some strong evidence that the virus can lead to childhood diabetes.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new live oral rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq) early in 2006, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that all infants should be immunized (3 liquid doses by mouth at 2, 4, and 6 months of age). After carefully monitoring cases of intussusception and other adverse effects associated with RotaTeq the FDA announced in March 2007 that the vaccine does not pose an increased risk of intussusception, a serious bowel problem that was associated with the previous rotavirus vaccine.\nRotarix, a second oral rotavirus vaccine, was approved by the FDA in April 2008. It is given in 2 doses to babies aged 6 - 24 weeks. As with RotaTeq, no increased risk of intussusception was seen in an extensive study of Rotarix that looked for this complication.\nVaccination against smallpox used to be routine in the U.S. until 1972, and most older Americans bear the telltale small round smallpox vaccination scar on their upper arms. Immunity may last 10 years or longer. The last case of smallpox, a highly contagious and deadly disease caused by the variola virus, occurred in a laboratory worker in the U.K. in 1978.\nHowever, the growing threat of bioterrorism has raised fears that smallpox could be used as a biological weapon, and in 2002 the US government issued plans for vaccinating every citizen against the disease in the event of an outbreak. The vaccination, however, carries some risks. Currently, vaccination is recommended only for laboratory workers and scientists who work with the virus.\nIf an outbreak occurs, guidelines from the CDC call for a \"ring vaccination\" approach. This involves identifying anyone who comes into contact with an infected person and vaccinating them and their contacts with a single dose of vaccine. A ring-vaccination includes people of all ages, even those at risk for vaccine complications. The vaccine may work even if given within the first few days of infection.\nOther types of vaccinations that are available include:\nRabies is a usually fatal, acute viral infection that is transmitted to humans by infected animals (often dogs or bats) via a bite, or by exposing broken skin to an infected animal's saliva. In the past, human cases in the U.S. usually resulted from a dog bite, but more cases of human rabies have been linked to bats. There have not been any rabies cases caused by dog bites for a number of years. As a result of extensive animal vaccination programs, few rabies cases occur in the U.S.\nAnyone who is exposed to bats or to the secretions of an animal suspected of having rabies should receive the rabies vaccine. Exposed individuals should also receive immune globulins unless they were previously vaccinated. Veterinarians and animal handlers should be routinely vaccinated. This does not eliminate the need for treatment if they are exposed to rabies, but it reduces the intensity of the treatment.\nSide effects of the vaccine include pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, headache, nausea, stomach pain, muscle aches, and dizziness. Allergic response can occur after the first shot and as many as 21 days after a booster shot. Rare cases of neurologic disorders that cause pain and paralysis in the legs and arms have also been reported. These neurologic disorders usually clear up in about 12 weeks.\n     Plague is a severe, and potentially deadly, infection. It is caused by the organism     Yersinia pestis     . Wild rodents, like rats, spread the disease to humans. Plague is spread among rodents by a flea bite. Humans may get the plague when they touch or eat the infected animal, or when they come in contact with its feces. Certain forms of the plague can be spread from human to human. Plague is rare in the United States, but has been known to occur in parts of California, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico.   \nVeterinarians and veterinarian assistants in the western U.S., or anyone who works with potentially plague-infected animals, as well as travelers to developing countries where outbreaks have occurred, should be vaccinated. The plague vaccine is not 100% protective; it may only lessen severity of the disease. Preventive antibiotics are needed for anyone exposed. Side effects of the vaccine include headache, malaise, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and, occasionally, non-infected abscesses. Allergic reactions may occur, particularly in those sensitive to beef, soy, milk, and phenol.\n     Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by the spore-forming bacteria called     Bacillus anthracis     . Infection in humans most often involves the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, or the lungs.   \nAnthrax commonly affects hoofed animals such as sheep and goats, but humans who come in contact with the infected animals can get sick from anthrax, too. Historically, the populations most at risk for anthrax included farm workers, veterinarians, and tannery and wool workers.\nAnthrax is a potential agent for use as a biological weapon or for bioterrorism. In 2001, bioterrorist activities involving the U.S. Postal Service infected 22 people with anthrax; 7 survivors had confirmed cutaneous anthrax disease.\nMilitary personnel and vaccine researchers, as well as people who work with imported animal hides, furs, bone meal, wool, animal hair (especially goat hair), and bristles, should receive an anthrax vaccine. The anthrax vaccine appears to be safe and effective, even after exposure, but requires 6 shots over 18 months. Up to half of recipients develop temporary soreness; some develop fever. Pregnant women should not get the anthrax vaccine.\nVaccine given orally for the prevention of respiratory illness.\nTravelers to developing countries where outbreaks have occurred, currently parts of Africa and Central and South America; residents of these areas, particularly children.\nVaccinations safe and effective for the prevention of jaundice and kidney and liver failure. Anaphylactic reactions in those allergic to eggs. Very rarely, may cause a potentially fatal illness resembling yellow fever, with fever and diarrhea, particularly in seniors. Lower immunity when given with cholera vaccine; these vaccines should be given three weeks apart.\nTravelers to developing countries where outbreaks have occurred.\nOral vaccines include: (Ty21a, Vivotif). The oral vaccines are not effective against parathyroid fever.\nOne-shot vaccine (Typhim Vi). Can be taken as early as two weeks before travel. Vi-rEPA is a newer injected vaccine that is safe in children and may be more effective-than other vaccines to date.\nNo vaccine is 100% effective. The response to the typhoid vaccine tends to be lower in older people.\nIndividuals exposed to infected people.\nBacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine has been the standard vaccine, but its effectiveness has been questioned. No longer recommended in US except for certain high-risk children. A new recombinant BCG vaccine, shown in early trials to be more effective, is now licensed for use and is undergoing continued study.\nPeople who are traveling to developing countries should check with the US Centers for Disease Control (www.cdc.gov\/travel) for up-to-date information on immunization requirements for their destination.\nAll travelers should be up-to-date on any recommended vaccinations for childhood diseases, regardless of their age. Booster shots may be required for travelers to developing countries even if they have completed their initial series\nSome countries may require vaccinations against yellow fever, meningitis, typhoid, cholera, Japanese encephalitis, and rabies under certain circumstances.\nStudies indicate that multiple vaccines may be given at the same time to most adults without significantly increasing adverse effects.\nwww.immunofacts.com -- Information on vaccinations\n     American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases.

Their families are barred from birthday parties and neighborhood play dates. Online, people call them negligent and criminal. And as officials in 14 states grapple to contain a spreading measles outbreak that began near here at Disneyland, the parents at the heart of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-vaccine movement are being blamed for incubating an otherwise preventable public-health crisis.\nMeasles anxiety rippled thousands of miles beyond its center on Friday as officials scrambled to try to contain a wider spread of the highly contagious disease \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which America declared vanquished 15 years ago, before a statistically significant number of parents started refusing to vaccinate their children.\nIn recent days, new measles cases popped up in Nebraska and Minnesota, New York and Marin County in California. Officials around the country reported rising numbers of patients who were seeking shots, as well as some pediatricians who were accepting nonvaccinated families but were debating changing their policies. The White House urged parents to listen to the science that supports inoculations.\nIn Arizona, health officials warned that 1,000 people could have been exposed to measles and urged anyone displaying symptoms to avoid this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Super Bowl events in the Phoenix area. In a small planned community where one family became ill after visiting Disneyland, store windows were lined with measles alerts, and a sign on the Pinal County office building warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stop! Measles is in our county!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and asked people with symptoms to wear masks before entering.\nBut here in California, anti-vaccine parents whose children have endured bouts of whooping cough and chickenpox largely defended their choice to raise their children on natural foods, essential oils and no vaccinations.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is absolutely no reason to get the shot,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Crystal McDonald, whose 16-year-old daughter was one of 66 students sent home from Palm Desert High School for the next two weeks because they did not have full measles immunizations.\nAfter researching the issue and reading information from a national anti-vaccine group, Ms. McDonald said she and her husband, a chiropractor, decided to raise their four children without vaccines. She said they ate well and had never been to the doctor, and she insisted that her daughter was healthier than many classmates. But when the school sent her home with a letter, Ms. McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter was so concerned about missing two weeks of Advanced Placement classes that she suggested simply getting a measles inoculation.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo, absolutely not,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Ms. McDonald said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather you miss an entire semester than you get the shot.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\nThe anti-vaccine movement can largely be traced to a 1998 report in a medical journal that suggested a link between vaccines and autism but was later proved fraudulent and retracted. Today, the waves of parents who shun vaccines include some who still believe in the link and some, like some Amish, who have religious objections to vaccines. Then there is a particular subculture of largely wealthy and well-educated families, many living in palmy enclaves around Los Angeles and San Francisco, who are trying to carve out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all-natural\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lives for their children.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes, I feel like we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re practicing in the 1950s,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Dr. Eric Ball, a pediatrician in southern Orange County, where some schools report that 50 to 60 percent of their kindergartners are not fully vaccinated and that 20 to 40 percent of parents have sought a personal beliefs exemption to vaccination requirements. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very frustrating. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see a kid suffer for something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entirely preventable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nTwo of Dr. Ball\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patients are unvaccinated girls who became sick with the measles last week, though they had not been at Disneyland and it was unclear how they had been infected. Their father called the clinic to tell Dr. Ball and has been sending digital photographs of the girls, their faces stippled with red dots, to update him on how they are doing.\nDr. Ball said he spent many days trying to persuade parents to vaccinate their children. He tries to alleviate their concerns. He shows parents his own children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccine records. But it has not worked, and lately, as worries and anger over this outbreak have spread, some families who support vaccines have said they do not want to be in the same waiting room as unvaccinated families. The clinic where Dr. Ball works has treated unvaccinated children for years, but its staff is meeting next week to discuss a ban.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our patients are really scared,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dr. Ball said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our nightmare would be for someone to show up at our door with the measles.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that measles cases soared last year to 644, many more than in any other year in more than a decade. Since Jan. 1, the C.D.C. has confirmed 84 measles cases in 14 states. California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health agency, which is updating a measles count more frequently, has reported 91 cases, with the biggest number, 27, here in Orange County.\nThe county\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccination rate for kindergartners is about 90 percent, a little lower than the statewide rate, 90.4 percent. But rates in some pockets, especially in the wealthier southern half, are sharply lower.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are different threads of concern out there\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when it comes to vaccination, said Matt Zahn, the medical director for epidemiology at the Orange County Health Agency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It becomes a game of Whack-a-Mole: As soon as you get rid of one issue, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe people most at risk of becoming seriously ill are babies too young to be vaccinated and the immunologically frail; measles can transform into something much worse, like encephalitis, and can be deadly. Among the fully vaccinated, the chances of contracting measles are small but do exist; the C.D.C. says the vaccine is more than 95 percent effective.\nOn Friday, all unvaccinated students who had been sent home from Huntington Beach High School after a possible measles exposure were allowed to return to school. But in Riverside County, officials reporting a probable case of a school employee with the measles ordered 40 students without vaccinations to stay home.\nSimilar scares are playing out far from Disneyland. In Kearny, Ariz., a small rural community with an economy tied to a nearby copper mine, a single family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas vacation has upended the rhythms of daily life. The family visited Disneyland in December, and four of its unvaccinated members came back with measles; a fifth person in Kearny also contracted the disease.\nNow, many businesses in town \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the grocery store, the post office, and more \u00e2\u20ac\u201d have measles alerts in the windows featuring a blond boy with a rash all over his face. Several signs say that someone with the measles was in the store at a specific time last week and advise others who were there at the same time to be alert to symptoms.\nSome parents in Kearny are sympathetic to the family that did not vaccinate children.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I strongly believe in getting children the vaccines they need to protect them from any childhood disease out there, but that is my opinion,\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 said Tiffany Magee, a mother of three. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I also strongly believe other parents have the right to choose not to get their children vaccinated due to religion or health reasons.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nKearny school officials sent a letter home to all parents, urging calm, noting that, other than the children in the affected family, all other students in the district had been vaccinated. But it also advised parents to keep an eye out for symptoms. The measles outbreak has dominated talk in town and in two Facebook groups that discuss Kearny goings-on, and it has altered the way some people in town think about vaccines.\nMissy Foster, 43, said she had not vaccinated her daughter, Tully, who is now 18 months old, against measles because of concern that the M.M.R. vaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which stands for measles, mumps and rubella, or German measles \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might be associated with autism.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst shot,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said, with tears in her eyes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you want to wake up one morning and the light is gone from her eyes with autism or something?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nBut as soon as Ms. Foster heard about the measles outbreak, she called her pediatrician and scheduled the vaccine, still with trepidation about possible side effects but with greater worries about measles. Now she is planning to stay home, leaving only to go to church, until the vaccine fully takes effect.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this would explode again, but it did,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ms. Foster said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want her to be protected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAnd Norm Warren, the manager of the supermarket in Kearny, Gordon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IGA, has changed his thinking toward those who do not vaccinate their children.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Before, I thought, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIf you think your child will become autistic, fine.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 But now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pushing their beliefs on everybody, and I feel differently,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How many lives have been saved by vaccination?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nMembers of the anti-vaccine movement said the public backlash had terrified many parents. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are now afraid they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be jailed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Barbara Loe Fisher, the president of the National Vaccine Information Center, a clearinghouse for resisters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m seeing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gotten so out of hand, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gotten so vicious.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIn San Geronimo, Calif., a mostly rural community of rolling hills and oak trees about 30 miles north of San Francisco, 40 percent of the students walking into Lagunitas Elementary School have not been inoculated against measles, according to the school\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures. Twenty-five percent have not been vaccinated for polio. In all, the state says that 58 percent of Lagunitas kindergartners do not have up-to-date vaccine records.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of people here have personal beliefs that are faith based,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said John Carroll, the school superintendent, who sent a letter home to parents last week encouraging them to vaccinate their children. The faith, Mr. Carroll said, is not so much religious as it is a belief that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they raise their children in a natural, organic environment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and are suspicious of pharmaceutical companies and big business.\nSome parents forgo shots altogether. Others split vaccine doses or stretch out their timeline, worried about somehow overwhelming their children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system. Kelly McMenimen, a Lagunitas parent, said she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meditated on it a lot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before deciding not to vaccinate her son Tobias, 8, against even \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deadly or deforming diseases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said she did not want \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so many toxins\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd entering the slender body of a bright-eyed boy who loves math and geography.\nTobias has endured chickenpox and whooping cough, though Ms. McMenimen said the latter seemed more like a common cold. She considered a tetanus shot after he cut himself on a wire fence but decided against it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He has such a strong immune system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAs Ciel Lorenzen, a massage therapist, picked up her children, Rio, 10, and Athena, 7, at Lagunitas Elementary, she defended her choice to not vaccinate either of them, even as health and school officials urged a different course.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to explore alternatives rather than go with the panic of everyone around you,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccines don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel right for me and my family.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n","173":"Disneyland is commonly referred to as the happiest place on earth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a fun-filled, attraction-packed amusement park for children and adults alike. Each year, over 16 million people travel to California to visit the park and then return home satisfied after their stay. Between January 1st and February 20th this year, however, 154 people from 17 different states were reported to have contracted measles, and 118 of these cases were linked directly to Disneyland. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the majority of the people who had been infected were unvaccinated against measles [1]. \nThis ongoing outbreak has garnered national media attention and sparked a hot-topic debate that essentially began in 1796, after Edward Jenner created the first modern vaccine. The main question is: should vaccinations be made mandatory?\nCurrently, the CDC recommends 28 doses of 10 different vaccines for children under 6 years old. Although there are no federal laws that mandate vaccinations, all 50 states have public school requirements. \nMost of these states, however, also allow for parents to exempt their children based on medical, religious, and even philosophical reasons. \nWhile some parents refuse vaccination based on the fear of an adverse effect (30,000 reactions reported since 1990), others argue that government-mandated vaccines would violate their constitutionally protected religious and personal freedoms. Supporters of required vaccinations, on the other hand, highlight the benefits: the \nCDC estimates that 732,000 lives were saved and 322 million cases of illness were prevented since 1990 through vaccinations alone [2].\nSo is there a definitive answer to this question? Is this question even relevant on an individual level? According to the Colorado School of Mines Health Center, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Colorado state law requires new freshman, transfer and graduate students submit proof of two doses each of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines. This is a mandatory requirement for all college students born on or after January 1, 1957\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [3]. To be a student at Mines, vaccinations are mandated. But to be a citizen of the United States, should these same requirements be held?\nSurveying\u00c2\u00a0Science\nAccording to a new survey performed by the Pew Research Center, only 13% of polled professional scientists thought that parents should be allowed to have their children exempted from vaccines. 30% of the general public, however, believed that vaccinations should be a choice [4]. So what is causing this gap between scientists and the public? Does science hold information that the average U.S. citizen does not?\nMatthew F. Daley and Jason M. Glanz (a pediatrician and epidemiologist, respectively) bring the growing numbers of deliberately unvaccinated children under the spotlight in their article \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Straight Talk about Vaccination,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which was published in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Scientific American\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nBased on responses to pediatricians, parents are mainly unwilling to vaccinate their children because they either do not think their children are at risk for diseases or they believe the vaccines themselves are innately dangerous.\nThe first reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no risk for infection \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can be proved false by the use of a study performed here, in the state of Colorado.\nBy examining hundreds of thousands of both vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects, it was found that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unvaccinated children were roughly 23 times more likely to develop whooping cough, nine times more likely to be infected with chickenpox, and 6.5 times more likely to be hospitalized with pneumonia or pneumococcal disease than vaccinated children from the same communities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [5]. From these numbers, it is clear that denying vaccinations increases the chance of disease. \nAccording to Daley and Glanz, the second main objection \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a fear of the vaccines causing more harm than good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stems from misinformation spread by both the media and the use of the internet. Although there are always risks to vaccines (with small percentages of adverse reactions), there have been some major claims questioning safety over the years that have served to strengthen the anti-vaccine movement. The most famous of these theories was published in the Lancet in 1998 by Andrew J. Wakefield, who claimed that the measles vaccine could cause autism in young children. Since then, many studies have disproved this claim and the article was later retracted in 2010. Despite the proof that this theory is false, a recent survey showed that around 25% of 1500 participants still believed it to be true [5]. This example serves to demonstrate the disconnection between science and the public. As a whole, however, despite any conflicting public opinion or misinformation, science shows that vaccines help protect children against diseases, with little risk. \nPossible\u00c2\u00a0Policies\nNow that science has shown that children should be vaccinated, the question still remains: should governments mandate their vaccinations? Vaccination policies vary greatly between different nations. Some countries have no requirements of any kind, while others have completely mandated programs. Here in the United States, there are mandated vaccines at the state level for children attending public school, but these policies lack consistency and often times, compliance. Professor Becky Lafrancois, from the CSM Economics and Business Department, offers her opinion on the topic:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153From what I have read, around a 95 percent vaccination rate is needed to provide community level immunity so as not to infect the 1 percent of the population who, for medical reasons, cannot be vaccinated. In Colorado, the vaccination rate amongst kindergarteners is only 82 percent on average, the lowest rate in the nation. From an economics perspective, it is clear that Colorado falls well below the socially optimal level of vaccination. The additional benefits to society from increasing vaccination rates likely outweigh the additional costs from doing so. Given this, there is a strong argument for some kind of government intervention in the vaccination market here in Colorado. There are several potential solutions, including a mandate. Another idea would be to impose a fine on those parents who choose to not vaccinate their children.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThere are currently other countries who have put some of these suggested solutions into place in order to increase vaccination rates. For example, Australian parents receive payments for every child that meets the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set requirements. The Slovenian government has implemented one of the strictest vaccination policies in the world by fining those who do not receive nine base vaccinations. Other nations provide vaccines free of charge as an incentive to receive them [6]. Essentially, there are many different policy options that could be implemented to increase vaccinations within the U.S. As citizens of Colorado \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the least vaccinated state in the country \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mines students should begin to consider what needs to change about state policy.\nThe\u00c2\u00a0Whole\u00c2\u00a0Picture\nThe measles outbreak at the beginning of this year shows that the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 current vaccination policy is not achieving socially optimal results. The anti-vaccination movement, which contradicts research, is continuing to grow as the gap between science and public opinion widens. To stop these outbreaks, action needs to be taken. The action must take religious and personal freedoms into consideration, yet still manage to increase vaccination rates. Perhaps the solution is to better educate parents about the risks of declining vaccinations for their children. Or maybe fines for lack of compliance should be implemented. No matter the course of action, however, the Disneyland measles outbreak demonstrates that the U.S. vaccination policy needs to change.\n","174":"As Summer Estall approached her first birthday, her mom, Lisa, had more on her mind than party plans. Summer was about to receive not only cake and presents, but also -- surprise! -- her fourth round of shots in ten months. \"Her last vaccinations had been tough,\" says Estall, of Grand Forks, North Dakota. \"She was her usual happy self after being examined by the doctor, but then we were called into a room where two nurses were both holding long needles. They told me to lay Summer on the table, pull her pants down, and pin down her arms. Of course, she started to scream, and it felt like I was preparing her for torture. By the time the nurses got the Band-Aids on, Summer seemed to be okay -- but I was a wreck.\"\nHowever, it wasn't just the painful pricks that worried Estall about her daughter's 12-month shots. \"Everywhere I go, someone's talking about the danger of vaccines,\" she says. \"There are moms posting about their kids' side effects on just about every online parenting forum. The other day I had coffee with two friends, and one of them said she wasn't vaccinating her kids. I can't help but wonder: Should I really be injecting a healthy child with these things?\"\nThe answer from the vast majority of medical experts is a resounding \"yes.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that healthy children get vaccinated against 14 diseases by age 2 (with boosters later for some), along with an annual inoculation against the flu. In fact, the government supports vaccines so strongly that any uninsured child can walk into a clinic and get his or her shots for free. \"Immunizations are simply one of the greatest public-health achievements,\" says Mary Glod\u00c3\u00a9, M.D., professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado in Denver.\nAnd yet, despite doctors' reassurances and mounting evidence that underscores the safety and value of vaccination, many educated, dedicated parents are still wary of vaccines -- or passionately opposed to them. Although the national immunization rate has remained stable over the past decade (76 percent of children ages 19 to 35 months were up-to-date on all of their shots in 2008), that's still short of the government's goal of 80 percent. In some pockets of the country, a rising number of parents are delaying shots for their kids or skipping certain ones altogether, citing religious or philosophical exemptions from state laws that require kids to be vaccinated in order to attend school. As a result, there have been recent outbreaks of serious diseases that vaccines had virtually wiped out in the U.S., including measles, mumps, pertussis (whooping cough), and haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), which was once the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in kids under 5.\nInfectious-disease specialists say these cases are due to a breakdown of what's known as \"herd immunity.\" In order for a community to be fully protected against a disease, 80 to 90 percent of its population needs to have been vaccinated, says pediatrician Lance Rodewald, M.D., director of the Immunization Services Division of the CDC. Whenever coverage drops significantly below that level, a school, a church, or a neighborhood becomes susceptible to the disease. Babies who aren't old enough to get the shot yet are at the greatest risk of becoming sick.\nMost of the recent measles outbreaks have been traced to individuals who visited a country where vaccine-preventable diseases still flourish. \"The fact is, all of these diseases still exist -- some circulate in this country and others are only a plane ride away,\" says Dr. Rodewald. \"They could easily become widespread again if more people refuse vaccines.\"\nAsk parents what scares them most about the shots, and you'll likely get one answer: autism. Many people believe that the increased number of vaccines -- children now get twice as many as they did in 1980 and can receive up to 20 injections by their first birthday -- are to blame for the rise in kids with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The idea first made headlines in 1998, when Andrew Wakefield, M.D., a British gastroenterologist, published a study of 12 children in The Lancet that linked the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) combination vaccine with intestinal problems that he believed led to autism. The following year, the AAP issued a warning about thimerosal, the mercury-containing preservative that was found in most vaccines. Though it didn't mention autism specifically, it suggested that the use of vaccines with thimerosal could theoretically push an infant's total exposure of mercury, a neurotoxin, above safe limits, and it recommended that the preservative be removed from shots. The vaccine-autism hypothesis was solidly in the mainstream by the time actress Jenny McCarthy went public with her belief that vaccines caused her son's autism, describing in heartbreaking detail how \"the soul left his eyes\" on a 2007 segment of the The Oprah Show. \"It was enough to scare any mother,\" says Eileen Pike, of West Palm Beach, Florida, who has chosen to delay certain vaccines for her son, now 23 months.\nHowever, at least seven large studies in major medical journals have now found no association between the MMR vaccine and ASD -- and this February, The Lancet officially retracted Dr. Wakefield's original paper. (Revelations that he had failed to disclose connections to lawyers involved in vaccine litigation also emerged.) In March, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, Office of Special Masters, a group of judges appointed to handle cases of families who believe immunizations were responsible for their child's autism, ruled that thimerosal in vaccines does not increase the risk of the disorder. (In 2008, a federal judge did award compensation to the family of Hannah Poling, a child with mitochondrial disorder, a rare condition that can show symptoms of autism, which she was diagnosed with shortly after receiving five vaccines.) Several demographic analyses have also found that autism rates continued to rise even after thimerosal was removed from all vaccines except some flu shots.\nSo why are there so many stories of children developing autism shortly after immunizations -- not just in the media, but also in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the federally cosponsored program that collects reports of suspected vaccine-related injury or illness? Experts believe that the association is almost certainly coincidental. Children get their first dose of the MMR vaccine at 12 to 15 months, the age at which autism symptoms typically become noticeable, says Paul Offit, M.D., director of the vaccine education center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the author of Autism's False Profits: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure. \"It's the same reason why there are reports of SIDS deaths after DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) immunizations,\" says Dr. Offit. \"Infants start the DTaP vaccine between 2 and 6 months, which is the time they're also most likely to die from SIDS.\" In fact, some autism activists now believe that we should't even do more studies about a possible vaccine connection because they take attention and money away from important research that is investigating other potential causes of the disorder. \"We have to move forward and be willing to accept what science tells us: Vaccines do not cause autism,\" says Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation and the mother of a child with autism.\nThat doesn't mean that vaccines aren't capable of causing adverse effects beyond a sore arm and a slight fever. In 1986, the government created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to reimburse families whose children had serious side effects, and it has awarded nearly $2 billion on 2,398 claims. But most doctors say that the odds of experiencing a vaccine-related injury are greatly outweighed by the dangers of catching a vaccine-preventable disease. The measles vaccine, for instance, can cause a temporary reduction in platelets (which control bleeding after an injury) in 1 in 30,000 children, but 1 in 2,000 will die if they get measles itself. The DTaP vaccine can cause seizures or a temporary \"shocklike\" state in 1 in 14,000 people, and acute encephalitis (brain swelling) in 11 in 1 million. But the diseases it prevents -- diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis -- are fatal in 1 in 20 cases, 1 in 10 cases, and 1 in 1,500 cases, respectively.\nIf the FDA determines that a vaccine poses a real risk to more than a tiny percentage of children, the agency won't let it be used. \"Before a new vaccine is approved, it goes through a prospective, placebo-controlled trial involving tens of thousands of children,\" says Dr. Offit, who was a cocreator of RotaTeq, one of two current rotavirus gastroenteritis vaccines. Once a vaccine is in use, side-effect reports are analyzed by the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a program that collects patient information from managed-care organizations. In 2001, government scientists concluded that Wyeth's Rotashield, an earlier vaccine against rotavirus, could cause one extra case of bowel obstruction for every 10,000 babies who were immunized each year, and they halted its use in the U.S. Sometimes vaccines are pulled from shelves as a precaution: In 2007, certain lots of Merck's Hib vaccine were recalled after the company found bacteria on manufacturing equipment, even though the vaccines themselves tested negative for contamination.\nThe Case for a \"Middle Ground\"\nNot all parents are reassured by facts like these. After all, most have met a child with autism; probably few have seen one who has crippling polio. Moms want to eliminate even a remote chance that their child will experience side effects from a vaccine, and they may fear that multiple injections could overwhelm the immune system. In fact, a national survey of parents published in Pediatrics last month (although conducted in 2009, before the retraction of Dr. Wakefield's study), found that 54 percent of parents were concerned about the serious adverse effects of vaccines, and 25 percent believed that some vaccines cause autism.\nEnter Robert Sears, M.D., author of The Vaccine Book: Making the Right Decision for Your Child. Published in 2007, it includes a different immunization schedule that delays or spaces out several vaccines so that children never receive more than two shots at a time -- and it has become a bible for many parents. Dr. Sears says that his main purpose is to make sure that children whose parents would otherwise opt out of immunizations get at least some protection. His top concern is aluminum, an ingredient that is added to half of all vaccines to boost their effectiveness. \"Most experts believe the amount of aluminum contained in vaccines is safe, but studies in human infants haven't proven that,\" says Dr. Sears. \"Spacing them out seems like the best way to limit overexposure.\"\nResearch has shown, however, that kids are exposed to more aluminum in breast milk or infant formula than through vaccines. And in 2004, The Cochrane Collaboration, an international not-for-profit health-care research organization, analyzed five studies on the effects of aluminum-containing vaccines and concluded that children who receive them are no more likely to experience any serious or long-lasting health problems than those who don't. For parents who are concerned about overburdening their child's immune system with multiple vaccines, Dr. Offit points out that young children are exposed to more antigens -- bacteria, viruses, toxins, and other substances that can stimulate disease-fighting antibodies -- in a single day of eating, playing, and breathing than they are through immunizations.\nWhile popular with some parents, Dr. Sears's alternative schedule has been criticized by the AAP. \"Vaccines protect babies' immature immune system,\" says Margaret Fisher, M.D., a pediatrician at The Children's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center, in New Jersey, and chair of the AAP section on infectious diseases. \"When you delay vaccines, you leave children unprotected against dangerous diseases at the time when they're most vulnerable.\" In 2008, for example, three of the five kids in Minnesota who developed invasive Hib disease (one of whom died) had parents who'd chosen to postpone vaccination. \"People always ask me, 'Which shot can I skip?'\" says Dr. Fisher. \"Honestly, I can't think of one I'd wait on.\"\nAt the heart of the vaccine debate is the idea that when you immunize your children you don't just protect them -- you help shield your entire community. Since some kids can't get certain vaccines because they are allergic to ingredients like eggs, or because they have immune-system deficiencies that prevent vaccines from working (such as those with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy), many people feel that it's up to healthy children to keep vaccination rates at a level that protects the \"herd\" as much as possible.\nThis argument isn't just pitting parents against parents -- it's also turning parents against their pediatricians. \"Parents often have a hard time reasonably assessing the risks involved because they've never had any experience with many of the diseases that vaccines prevent,\" says Parents advisor Ari Brown, M.D., a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and author of Baby 411. \"But I've seen children with serious cases of measles, mumps, and whooping cough, and I have seen a child die from chicken pox. I promise you that these are diseases you don't want your child to get.\"\nAlthough some doctors are refusing to take on patients whose families don't plan to immunize, it's important for parents and pediatricians to have respectful conversations. In the end, many doctors say that the strongest statement they can make in favor of vaccinating kids is to point to the family photos on their office walls. \"Sometimes the only way that I can get through to nervous parents is by telling them that I don't do anything different for my own two children,\" says Dr. Brown. \"Fortunately, most parents do decide to vaccinate.\"\nThat was the case last year when Lisa Estall overcame her fears and celebrated Summer's first birthday with a round of immunizations. And it was the case when Alison Singer brought her 12-year-old daughter, Jodie, who has autism, in for an H1N1 shot. \"Kids were dying all across the country from this flu. Just because my daughter has autism doesn't mean she should be denied a potentially lifesaving vaccine,\" she says. \"On the contrary, I wanted her to be protected.\"\n","175":"PatientPlus articles are written by UK doctors and are based on research evidence, UK and European Guidelines. They are designed for health professionals to use, so you may find the language more technical than the condition leaflets.\nSee also separate article Smallpox.\nEdward Jenner (1749-1823) published work in 1798 entitled \"An enquiry into the causes and effects of the variolae vaccinae\". This work was done following earlier observations that dairymaids and cowmen did not catch smallpox although they did catch cowpox. Benjamin Jesty (1737-1816) protected his family in a similar way before Jenner reported the first scientific attempt at immunisation from a hut near his home in Berkeley, Gloucestershire. Jenner scratched material from a cowpox pustule into the arm of a young local boy, James Phipps, who subsequently developed a pustule and a fever. He remained healthy when subsequently Jenner inoculated him with smallpox. \"Vaccinae\" means \"of the cow\" and \"vaccination\" means \"protection from smallpox\". At this time there were 23,000 deaths per year from smallpox in England and many more across Europe. The case fatality rate was between 20% and 60%. In 1853 compulsory smallpox vaccination was introduced and, in December 1979, the Global Commission for the Certification of Smallpox Eradication declared the world free of smallpox. In 1980 this was ratified by the World Health Assembly.[1] There is now no indication for routine smallpox vaccination.\nSmallpox is caused by the variola virus, a DNA virus, with humans being the only known reservoir for the disease. It is spread by person-to-person contact, with an incubation period of 10 to 14 days. The overall mortality is about 30%.\nThe most widely used virus used for smallpox inoculation is Vaccinia (derived from the genus Orthopoxvirus). This is a double-stranded DNA virus sharing antigenicity with the Variola virus, usually prepared from calf lymph. Research is underway using recombinant DNA techniques to find a safer vaccine without replication of the Vaccinia virus. Current vaccines give protection for 5 years (partial immunity for 10 years or more) with 95% conversion rate after primary vaccination and some protection if given within a few days of exposure. It is administered by multiple skin puncture using a bifurcated needle, containing small quantities of the vaccine. A papule develops after 3-5 days and becomes vesicular and pustular over 8-10 days, followed by scab and scar formation.[2]\nSmallpox vaccine is less safe than other vaccines used routinely today. A third of recipients get mild vaccine-related symptoms. More serious reactions occur infrequently: death (1\/million vaccinations); eczema vaccinatum (39\/million vaccinations); progressive vaccinia (1.5\/million vaccinations); post vaccinial encephalitis (12\/million vaccinations); and generalised vaccinia (241\/million vaccinations).[2]\nRisk factors for complications and adverse effects include eczema, any conditions disrupting the epidermis (acne, psoriasis, burns, seborrhoeic dermatitis, etc), the immunocompromised, immunosuppressed patients, pregnancy, and children under the age of 1 year.[2]\nThere is no indication for smallpox vaccination except for:\nWorkers in laboratories where pox viruses are handled and others whose work involves an identifiable risk of exposure to pox virus.\nLaboratory workers should be informed of the need for vaccination when appropriate. They may have fears about adverse effects which need to be addressed.[3] Concerns have been expressed about smallpox in relation to bioterrorism and the availability of vaccine when half of the world's population is unvaccinated.[4] Vaccines for the protection of troops need to be maintained.[5]\nIf wider use of vaccine is being considered, see \"Guidelines for smallpox response and management in the post-eradication era\".[6]\nFor further advice and guidance for laboratory staff, see Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens and Advisory Committee on Genetic Modification 1990.

The MMR vaccine is very safe and is not linked with autism or bowel diseases.\nMMR stands for measles, mumps and rubella. These are three different diseases which are caused by three different viruses. The vaccines given to immunise against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) are all combined into one injection - the MMR vaccine.\nEven if you think your child has already had one of these diseases, your child should still have MMR immunisation.\nThe first dose of vaccine is usually given between 12 and 13 months. It is usually given at the same time as the Hib\/MenC vaccine - this stands for 'Haemophilus influenzae type b\/meningitis C' and the pneumoccocal vaccine (given as separate injections).\nA second dose is usually given at age 3 years and 4 months to 5 years at the same time as the DTaP\/IPV injection. (DTaP stands for diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) and acellular pertussis (aP) (whooping cough). IPV stands for inactivated polio vaccine. Polio is short for poliomyelitis.)\nEven if a dose of MMR is delayed for any reason, it can still be given at a later age. If necessary, MMR vaccine can be given at any age.\nMost children are perfectly well after having a dose of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Serious problems with the MMR vaccine are extremely rare. However:\nSome children develop a mild raised temperature (fever) and a faint rash 7-10 days later. This should only last for 2-3 days and is of no concern.\nMild reactions such as a slight fever, a mild sore throat and joint pains sometimes occur about 1-3 weeks after the injection. These soon subside and are of no consequence.\nA few children develop a mild swollen face (like a mild form of mumps) about three weeks later. Any swelling will gradually go down.\nNone of these reactions is infectious or serious. If necessary, you can give paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease pain and fever. Any reaction to the vaccine is much less after the second vaccine is given.\nPregnant women. Also, you should not become pregnant for one month after having a rubella (MMR) immunisation. It is safe, however, to have if you are breast-feeding.\nIf you are having chemotherapy or if your immune system is suppressed for other reasons.\nIf you are seriously ill (for example, if you have a severe infection) you should postpone the vaccine until you are better. However, if the illness is minor, the vaccine need not be delayed. The typical example is a child who gets a tummy bug or earache on the day the vaccine is due. Providing they do not have a temperature and are well in themselves, the injection can be given.\nIf you are allergic to the medicines neomycin or gelatin (which are part of the vaccine).\nNote: if you are allergic to eggs, you may receive the vaccine safely.\nIn the past, there was been speculation that the MMR vaccine may somehow cause autism or inflammatory bowel disease. Large studies have all concluded that there is no evidence to link MMR immunisation to either of these conditions.\nMeasles is a highly infectious illness caused by the measles virus. Beginning like a bad cold, the child then develops a raised temperature (fever) and a rash. The child feels miserable and may be unwell for a week or so with a bad cough and a high temperature. Complications occur in about 1 in 15 children with measles.\nMeasles is much more serious than many people think. In fact, of all childhood infections, it is the one most likely to cause the complication of inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), sometimes resulting in brain damage. It can also cause convulsions, ear infections, bronchitis and pneumonia, which can lead to long-term lung problems. Each year a number of children die from measles. In developing countries it is a major cause of childhood death. Unfortunately, measles is becoming more common again in children in some areas of the UK. This is due to some children not receiving the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.\nMumps infection typically causes inflammation and swelling of the glands around the face, neck and jaw. It is usually a mild illness but complications occur in some children, such as inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), inflammation of the testes (orchitis), meningitis and (inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). Mumps may cause permanent deafness in one ear. Mumps is equally dangerous for boys and girls.\nRubella\u00c2\u00a0is usually a mild illness causing a rash, sore throat and swollen glands. However, if a pregnant women has rubella, the virus is likely to cause serious damage to the unborn child. Rubella can lead to damage to the heart, brain, hearing and sight. The baby is likely to be born with a very serious condition called the congenital rubella syndrome. See separate leaflet called Rubella (German Measles) and Pregnancy which provides more details on this condition.\nSince rubella immunisation was introduced in 1970 there has been a dramatic fall in the number of babies born with the congenital rubella syndrome. Rubella is now a very uncommon infection in the UK as a result of the vaccination programme.\nPatient is one of the most trusted medical resources online, supplying evidence based information on a wide range of medical and health topics to patients and health professionals.\n Trending search phrases: bmi calculator, scarlet fever, blood pressure, cystic fibrosis, pregnancy symptoms, glandular fever, multiple sclerosis, prostate cancer, depression test, rheumatoid arthritis \n","177":"PatientPlus articles are written by UK doctors and are based on research evidence, UK and European Guidelines. They are designed for health professionals to use, so you may find the language more technical than the condition leaflets.\nThere are two components to preventing hepatitis B:\nPrevention of transmission of the virus.\nImmunisation.\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) is spread by exposure to infected blood or body fluids. Methods of transmission include:[1]\u00c2\u00a0\nVaginal or anal sexual intercourse.\nBlood-to-blood transmission:\nSharing of injection equipment by intravenous drug users.\nNeedlestick injuries.\nBlood transfusion - now rare in the UK as blood products are screened.\nInfected tattoo equipment.\nBites (rare).\nPerinatal transmission from mother to child.\nThe relative frequency of these methods of transmission varies from country to country. In low-risk countries such as the UK, transmission is most often through sexual contact or between injecting drug users.\nSee separate Hepatitis B article.\nPractise safe sex.\nAvoid sharing intravenous drug equipment.\nWear gloves when exposed to blood or body fluids.\nClear up blood or body fluids, using warm water and detergent.\nEnsure surgical instruments are disposable or adequately sterilised.\nHandle 'sharps' safely.\nWear goggles if there is risk of infected material splashing into the eye.\nDo not permit healthcare workers who are positive for hepatitis B antigen to work in areas where they could be a risk to others.\nThe vaccine contains hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) adsorbed on to aluminium hydroxide adjuvant.\nThere is also a combined vaccine available with provides protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.\nHepatitis B vaccines do not contain live organisms.\nThe vaccine should be stored in a refrigerator at a temperature between 2\u00c2\u00b0C and 8\u00c2\u00b0C.\nHepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective but should not be seen as an alternative to a strategy of prevention of transmission.\nThose who may be exposed to blood or blood products through their occupation:\nPeople travelling to or going to reside in areas of high or intermediate prevalence, particularly travellers with pre-existing medical conditions, who may be at higher risk of requiring medical procedures abroad.\nThose individuals who change sexual partners frequently, particularly commercial sex workers.\nPeople receiving regular blood or blood products - for example, those with haemophilia or chronic anaemias.\nPrisoners and prison officers.\nFamily contacts of those with chronic hepatitis B infection.\nFamilies adopting children from high-risk countries.\nThose patients with chronic kidney disease or chronic liver disease.\nSince 1982, over one billion doses of hepatitis B vaccine have been used worldwide. In many countries where 8% to 15% of children used to become chronically infected with HBV, vaccination has reduced the rate of chronic infection to less than 1% among immunised children.[2]\u00c2\u00a0There is also evidence that the hepatitis B vaccine reduces the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.[3]\u00c2\u00a0\nDosage depends on age and brand. The manufacturer's guidance should be followed.\nInjections are given intramuscularly in the upper arm or anterolateral thigh. It should not be given into the buttock.\nThe standard course of immunisation involves three injections at 0, 1 and 6 months.\nAn accelerated course of 0, 1 and 2 months is possible - also for combined hepatitis A and B vaccines.\nAdults who need protection very quickly (eg, within 48 hours of exposure) can have a schedule of 0, 7 and 21 days. Adults and children considered at very high risk should also have an accelerated schedule. After an accelerated course, a booster at one year is recommended.\nAccelerated courses may also be best for drug abusers, as they are notoriously difficult to get to complete a course.\nThe duration of protection provided by the hepatitis B vaccine is still unknown but is believed to be at least 20 years.[4]\nIt is quite possible that a course may give lifelong immunity. However, it is recommended that individuals at continuing risk of infection should be offered a single booster dose of vaccine, once only, around five years after primary immunisation. Measurement of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) levels is not required either before or after this dose.\nTesting for anti-HBs routinely is not recommended. It is only advised in certain groups:\nAntibody titres should be checked one to four months after the completion of a primary course of vaccine.\nUnder the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations, individual workers have the right to know whether or not they have been protected.\nThis information allows appropriate decisions to be made concerning post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) following known or suspected exposure to the virus.\nAntibody responses to hepatitis B vaccine vary widely between individuals. 10-15% of adults fail to respond, or have a poor response.\nIt is preferable to achieve anti-HBs levels above 100 mIU\/mL.\nHowever, levels of 10 mIU\/mL or more are generally accepted as enough to protect against infection.\nResponders with anti-HBs levels greater than or equal to 100 mIU\/mL do not require any further primary doses. Further assessment of antibody levels is then not indicated. They should then receive the reinforcing booster dose at five years.\nResponders with anti-HBs levels of 10-100 mIU\/mL should receive one additional dose of vaccine at that time. Following this, further assessment of antibody levels is not indicated. They should then receive the reinforcing dose at five years.\nAn antibody level below 10 mIU\/mL is classified as a non-response to vaccine. In this situation, testing for markers of current or past infection is considered good clinical practice. A repeat course of vaccine is advised, followed by retesting one to four months after the second course. Those who still have anti-HBs levels below 10 mIU\/mL and who have no markers of current or past infection will require hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) for protection in the event of exposure to the virus.\nPeople with chronic kidney disease on dialysis:\nThe role of immunological memory in patients with chronic kidney disease on renal dialysis is not clear. Protection may persist only as long as anti-HBs levels remain above 10 mIU\/mL.\nAntibody levels should be monitored annually and if they fall below 10 mIU\/mL, a booster dose of vaccine should be given to patients who have previously responded to the vaccine.\nBooster doses should also be offered to any haemodialysis patients who are intending to travel to high-risk countries if they have previously responded to the vaccine, especially if they are to receive haemodialysis and have not received a booster in the preceding 12 months.\nSpecific HBIG provides passive immunity.\nIt can give immediate but temporary protection in the event of exposure.\nHBIG is given concurrently with hepatitis B vaccine and does not affect the development of active immunity. HBIG gives protection until the hepatitis B vaccine becomes effective. The two should be given in different sites.\nIt is recommended in high-risk situations, or for those known to be non-responders.\nIf the infection occurred at the time of immunisation, administration of HBIG may still prevent the development of carrier status.\nPEP involves giving hepatitis B vaccine and possibly immunoglobulin too if required. PEP may be indicated even if the exposed person has received hepatitis B vaccine previously. It should be given ideally within 48 hours but no later than seven days after exposure. The vaccine is not needed for those people who have HbsAg or anti-HBs. However, the vaccine should not be delayed whilst awaiting blood test results.\nPost-exposure vaccination is required in the following situations:\nBabies born to mothers who are chronic carriers of HBV or to mothers who have had acute hepatitis B during pregnancy. (Full course of primary vaccine +\/- HBIG.)\nSexual contacts of people known to have acute hepatitis B. (Vaccine for sexual contacts at diagnosis, additional HBIG if unprotected contact occurred in the preceding week.)\nAccidental exposure from blood. For example needlestick injuries, or contaminated blood coming into contact with open areas of skin, eyes or mouth. See separate Needlestick Injury article. Vaccination schedule depends on degree of risk and vaccination\/response history. If the site of exposure is a 'needlestick' injury, cut or abrasion, the site should be washed immediately with soap and water.\nBabies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B have a high risk of acquiring infection, which can be prevented by vaccination at birth. Therefore all women in the UK are screened during each pregnancy for hepatitis B. If a mother not previously booked for antenatal care presents in labour, she should have urgent hepatitis B screening, so that if needed the vaccine can be given to the infant within 24 hours of birth. Those women who are HbeAg-positive are particularly infectious, and there is a 70-90% risk of transmitting infection to the baby.\nTimely vaccination can reduce the risk of infection of neonates by over 90%.\nAll babies with seropositive mothers should have the full primary course of hepatitis B immunisation and most should also have HBIG within 24 hours of birth in addition. All babies weighing less than 1500 g born to infected mothers should have HBIG as well as primary immunisation. An accelerated schedule is preferred in all babies born to infected mothers, with a fourth dose along with testing for HBsAg at one year of age. Those for whom vaccination has not been effective and who have become infected with hepatitis B are then identified early and can be followed up and managed appropriately. This reduces the risk of serious liver disease in later life.\nAdverse reactions to the vaccine are few and usually mild:\nThere may be some soreness and erythema around the site. These are the most common reactions.\nFatigue, malaise and influenza-like symptoms are rare.\nRare associations with a Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9-type syndrome and also multiple sclerosis have been reported but a causal relationship has not been substantiated.\nHBIG is well tolerated. Reactions and side-effects are rare.\nThe only contra-indication to hepatitis B vaccines is previous anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine or one of its components.\nVaccination should be postponed in the presence of acute illness with fever and systemic symptoms.\nPregnancy and breast-feeding are not contra-indications and there is no evidence of risk in giving hepatitis B vaccinations in these situations.\nLive vaccines should not be given within three months of administering HBIG, as it may interfere with development of immunity (other than yellow fever).\nDisclaimer: This article is for information only and should not be used for the diagnosis or treatment of medical conditions.

It is passed to humans from bites or scratches from animals that carry the rabies virus. There is no cure for rabies but there is a vaccine to prevent it. This can be given to people who are at risk of rabies. People who should be immunised against rabies include those who work with animals, and people who travel to remote areas where medical help is not available. The vaccine can also prevent rabies infection after a high-risk bite. Treatment with an anti-serum and vaccine works well if you receive them soon after being bitten.\nRabies is a disease caused by a virus. Almost everyone who develops rabies will die from it. Fortunately there is a vaccine to prevent it which is very effective.\nSymptoms usually start 3-12 weeks after being bitten or scratched by an animal (usually a dog) carrying the rabies virus. However, symptoms may occur months or even years after a bite from an infected animal. The virus passes through the cut skin and travels (gradually) into the nervous system. After symptoms develop, most people die in less than two weeks.\nSymptoms of rabies include:\nInitially mild symptoms of infection with a virus - headache, a raised temperature, and feeling sick (nausea) and generally unwell.\nA numb feeling in the skin around the area where the bite or scratch was.\nBeing very agitated and not being able to sleep.\nBeing very confused.\nFrothing at the mouth and having difficulty swallowing.\nBeing afraid of water.\nFits (convulsions).\nMuscle spasms.\nNot being able to move certain muscles (paralysis). This eventually includes not being able to use breathing muscles.\nAt present, the UK is virtually free of rabies. The strict regulations for imported animals help to keep rabies out of the UK. Animals coming into the UK must have proof they are clear of and immune to rabies. In the UK in recent years a very few people have died from rabies which they contracted from animal bites whilst abroad. There is a small risk from rabies in bats in the UK but not from other animals.\nHowever, rabies is present in most of the rest of the world. Worldwide, there are more than 60,000 human cases each year. India has the highest number of cases of rabies. Dogs are the main carriers of rabies. Foxes, cats, bats, monkeys, raccoons and skunks can also be affected. A bite from any of these animals from any country outside the UK should be taken very seriously.\nPeople who are at risk of infection with rabies are advised to have the rabies vaccine as a precaution. In the UK, people whose work puts them at risk of rabies are entitled to vaccination on the NHS:\nPeople working with the rabies virus in laboratories.\nPeople who work with imported animals.\nPeople who regularly handle species of bats in the UK.\nPeople whose work might bring them into contact with rabid animals. (Most staff in veterinary practices do not need rabies vaccination, unless they are handling bats or imported animals.)\nHealthcare workers who come into contact with patients with rabies.\nPeople working abroad in high-risk countries who may be in contact with animals with rabies. (For example, veterinary staff or zoologists)\nIn addition, people travelling to areas where there is a high risk of rabies may be advised to have the vaccine. This is not available on the NHS and must be paid for. This includes:\nTravellers to parts of the world at risk of rabies where medical treatment may not be available. For example:\nPeople travelling to parts of the world where rabies is common and who are likely to be involved in activities which put them at greater risk. For example, running, cycling, working with animals.\nPeople travelling to parts of the world where rabies is common, who will be there for over a month.\nVaccines for travellers are available through GP surgeries, some pharmacies, and travel clinics. Information on the risk of rabies in the country you are travelling to is available from a number of organisations. For example, Fit for Travel (see below), the National Travel Health Network and Centre (see below), and Public Health England (see references below). Whether you need rabies vaccination will depend on:\nWhich country you are visiting, and in some cases which part of the country\nWhat you will be doing while you are there\nHow long you are staying\nHow old you are. (Children may be at higher risk, as they are more likely to pet stray animals.)\nThe rabies vaccine can be given:\nAs a precaution, to people who have not been bitten but who are at risk of a bite from an animal with rabies. This is called pre-exposure prophylaxis.\nTo people who have had a bite or scratch from an animal which might have rabies, to prevent them getting the rabies infection. This is called post-exposure prophylaxis.\nBoth. Even if you have had the rabies vaccine as a precaution, if you are then bitten, you need further doses to make sure you do not develop the disease. However, if you have had the vaccine beforehand, you will not need so many injections after a bite. If you have had the vaccine beforehand, you also have better protection against the rabies virus.\nThe injection is usually given in the muscle at the top of your arm.\nThree doses of vaccine are usually given. The first injection, a second injection seven days later and a third injection 21-28 days after the first injection. The vaccine is very effective - almost 100%. That is, it will stop nearly everybody who has had it getting rabies if they are bitten by an animal with rabies. The vaccine stimulates your body to make proteins called antibodies against the rabies virus. These antibodies protect you from rabies should you become infected with this virus.\nBooster doses may be required after one year and then every 3-5 years for people whose work gives them a risk of contact with the rabies virus. People who are at a smaller risk by travelling again into areas with rabies may need a booster after ten years.\nIf your work puts you at risk of rabies, you may need a blood test to confirm you are immune from rabies. This may need to be checked regularly and a booster dose of the vaccine given if the blood test shows you are not immune.\nIf you have a bite or scratch from an animal thought to be at risk of rabies (or an animal known to have rabies), you will need a course of the rabies vaccine. This may be two or five further doses of the injection. How many doses you need depends on how high a risk of rabies you have. This will in turn depend on:\nWhich country you were in when you were bitten and how high the risk is there\nWhat is known about the animal which gave you the injury (for example, which species of animal, if it is known to have rabies, if it has had rabies vaccinations).\nHow bad the injury is and where it is\nWhether you have had the pre-exposure injections or not.\nThese injections are available on the NHS. You will have them over a week (2-injection course) or a month (5-injection course). If you have not previously had the pre-exposure rabies vaccines, you will also have an injection of a substance called human rabies-specific immunoglobulin (HRIG). This will protect you from rabies for a short time, while you wait for your vaccine to start to work. HRIG is injected either into your wound, or into the muscle in your upper leg.\nIf you have an illness causing a high temperature (fever) it is best to postpone immunisation until after the illness.\nYou should not have a booster if you have had a severe allergic reaction to this vaccine in the past.\nYou should not have a rabies vaccination if you have had a severe allergic reaction to one of the components in the vaccine in the past. (For example, it contains traces of an antibiotic called neomycin, so you should not have it if you are severely allergic to neomycin.)\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding you may still be advised to have the vaccine if the risk of exposure to rabies is high.\nThere may be slight redness and swelling in the arm for 1-2 days, where the injection was given. Occasionally there are other side-effects such as a mild raised temperature, muscle aches or feeling sick (nausea). These soon pass without leaving any problems. Severe reactions are extremely rare.\nYou should avoid any contact with wild or domestic animals when travelling abroad. If you are bitten by an animal in an at-risk country then:\nWash the wound immediately with running water (and soap if possible) for at least five minutes. Disinfectant and a simple dressing may be applied to the wound.\nSeek medical attention as soon as possible even if you have been previously immunised, as further treatment may be given to reduce the risk of infection. You may need to have more doses of the vaccine. You may also need to have an injection of HRIG mentioned above. This will not be needed if you have already had a course of the vaccine.\nCommon searches for this page include: what is rabies, rabies immunisation, is rabies immunisation effective, reasons for rabies immunisation, what causes rabies, rabies causes, how do you get rabies, symptoms of rabies, rabies symptoms, treatment for rabies, is rabies treatable\n","179":"People at increased risk of contracting hepatitis B should be immunised. The hepatitis B vaccine can also be used to prevent infection if, for example, you have had a needlestick injury and you are not immunised. Some people need blood tests to check if they are immune. See your practice nurse if you think you need this vaccine.\nHepatitis B is an infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. The infection mainly affects the liver. However, if you are infected, the virus is present in body fluids such as blood, saliva, semen and vaginal fluid. In the UK it is estimated that about 1 person in 200 to 1000 is infected with the hepatitis B virus. It varies widely depending on the part of the UK studied.\u00c2\u00a0 It is much more common in other countries. It is most common in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia.\nIf you are infected with the hepatitis B virus, the initial symptoms can range from no symptoms at all to a severe illness. After this initial phase, in a number of cases the virus remains in the body long-term. These people are called carriers. Some carriers do not have any symptoms but can still pass on the virus to other people. About 1 in 4 carriers eventually develop a serious liver disease such as cirrhosis. In some cases liver cancer develops after a number of years. See separate leaflet called Hepatitis B for more details of the disease.\nIf you are pregnant and are infected with the hepatitis B virus, you can pass it on to your baby as the baby is being born. Vaccinations for the baby can prevent this happening. So all pregnant women in the UK are offered testing for hepatitis B during each pregnancy. If the test is positive, the baby can be protected.\nThe hepatitis B virus is passed from person to person in one of these ways:\nBlood to blood contact. For example, drug users sharing needles or other equipment which may be contaminated with infected blood. (Blood used for transfusion is now screened for hepatitis B virus.) Healthcare workers can be infected through accidental needlestick injuries.\nHaving unprotected sex with an infected person.\nAn infected mother passing it to her baby.\nA human bite from an infected person. This is very rare.\nAnyone who is at increased risk of being infected with the hepatitis B virus should consider being immunised. This includes:\nWorkers who are likely to come into contact with blood products, or are at increased risk of needlestick injuries, assault, etc. For example:\nPeople who inject street drugs. Also:\nPeople who change sexual partners frequently (in particular, sex workers).\nPeople who live in close contact with someone infected with hepatitis B. (You cannot catch hepatitis B from touching people or normal social contact. However, close regular contacts are best immunised.)\nPeople who regularly receive blood transfusions (for example, people with haemophilia).\nPeople with certain kidney or liver diseases.\nPeople who live in residential accommodation for those with learning difficulties. People who attend day centres for people with learning difficulties may also be offered immunisation.\nFamilies adopting children from countries with a higher risk of hepatitis B, when the hepatitis B status of the child is unknown. (It is, however, advisable for the child to be tested for hepatitis B.)\nFoster carers or if you live with foster children.\nPrison inmates. Immunisation against hepatitis B is now recommended for all prisoners in the UK.\nTravellers to countries where hepatitis B is common. In particular, those who place themselves at risk when abroad. The risk behaviour includes sexual activity, injecting drug use, undertaking relief work and\/or participating in contact sports. Also, if you may need a medical or dental procedure in these countries and the procedure may not be done with sterile equipment.\nBabies who are born to infected mothers.\nYou need three doses of the vaccine for full protection. The second dose is usually given one month after the first dose. The third dose is given five months after the second dose.\nOne to four months after the third dose you may need to have a blood test. You may need one if you are at risk of infection at work, especially as a healthcare or laboratory worker or if you have certain kidney diseases. Your doctor will be able to advise you if you need a blood test. This checks if your body has made proteins to protect you (antibodies) against the hepatitis B virus. If you have, you will not be able to get it (ie you are immune.)\nYou may then need a booster dose five years later. There is no need for a blood test before or after this.\nThe schedule is the same for the combined hepatitis A and B vaccine which is also available.\nA schedule of giving three doses more quickly than usual may be used in some situations. That is, three doses with each dose a month apart. An even quicker schedule is also sometimes used. That is, the second dose given seven days after the first and the third dose given 21 days after the first.\nThese rapid schedules may be used if you are at very high risk of infection and need to be immune as soon as possible. For example, if you are soon to travel abroad, are new to prison or are sharing needles to inject drugs. However, a more rapid schedule may not be as effective for long-term immunity unless a fourth dose is given 12 months after the first dose. Your doctor will advise on the best schedule for your circumstances.\nSide-effects are uncommon. Occasionally, some people develop soreness and redness at the injection site. Rarely, some people develop a mild high temperature (fever) and a flu-like illness for a few days after the injection.\nSeek medical attention as soon as possible if you have been at risk from a possible source of infection and you are not immunised. For example, if you have a needlestick injury or have been bitten by someone who may have hepatitis B.\nYou should have an injection of immunoglobulin as soon as possible. This is an injection which contains antibodies against the virus. It gives short-term protection. You should also start a course of immunisation. The hepatitis B vaccine is very effective at preventing infection if given shortly after contact with hepatitis B. Even if you have had the hepatitis B vaccine and are at risk of infection (for example, by having unprotected sex or sharing contaminated needles), you should ask your doctor for advice. You may be advised to have a booster vaccine or even an injection of immunoglobulin.\nBabies who are born to infected mothers should have an injection of immunoglobulin as soon as possible after they are born. They should also be immunised. The first dose of vaccine is given within the first day after birth. This is followed by three further doses at 1 month, 2 months and 12 months of age. At 12 months, immunised babies have a blood test to check that the vaccine has worked.\nIf you have an illness causing a high temperature, it is best to postpone immunisation until after the illness.\nYou should not have a booster if you have had a severe reaction to this vaccine in the past.\nThe vaccine may be given if you are pregnant or breast-feeding and immunisation against hepatitis B is necessary.\nPatient is one of the most trusted medical resources online, supplying evidence based information on a wide range of medical and health topics to patients and health professionals.\n","180":"PatientPlus articles are written by UK doctors and are based on research evidence, UK and European Guidelines.

It provides protection for approximately 90% of recipients for measles and mumps and over 95% for rubella.[1]\u00c2\u00a0\nTwo doses are given as part of the routine immunisation schedule but it is also important to identify special groups who need immunisation. It is also now an important vaccine in the control of outbreaks of measles.\nAll currently used live vaccines (BCG, rotavirus, live attenuated influenza vaccine, oral typhoid vaccine, yellow fever, varicella, zoster and MMR) and tuberculin (Mantoux) skin testing\u00c2\u00a0can be administered at any time before or after each other. There are three exceptions:\u00c2\u00a0MMR and yellow fever vaccines should have a minimum interval of 4 weeks; MMR and varicella (or zoster) vaccines should have a minimum of a 4 week interval if not given on the same day; tuberculin skin testing (Mantoux), where the\u00c2\u00a0test has already been initiated, MMR should be delayed until the skin test has been read, unless protection against measles is required urgently.\u00c2\u00a0If child has had recent MMR and requires a tuberculin test, a 4-week interval should be observed.\nAll children should be given the first dose prior to school entry, unless contra-indicated. See separate article Immunisation Schedule (UK).\nThe optimum age for the first dose is 12-13 months.\nA booster dose should be given between ages 3 years and 4 months to 5 years.\nIf the child has missed the first dose, give two doses, three months apart. Give the vaccine irrespective of previous history of infection.\nIf a dose of MMR is given before the child's first birthday, either because of travel to an endemic country or because of a local outbreak, this dose should be ignored and two further doses given at the recommended times (ie between 12 and 13 months of age and at 3 years and 4 months to 5 years of age).\nCheck immunisation status when giving the school-leaving age immunisations (does not normally include MMR). Give an MMR booster if only one dose has been given previously and two doses, three months apart if no previous dose has been given.\nWhere protection against measles is urgently required, the second dose can be given one month after the first.\nIf the child is given the second dose less than three months after the first dose and at less than 18 months of age then the routine preschool dose (a third dose) should be given in order to ensure full protection.\nBetween 25 April 2013 and 31 March 2014, there was an MMR catch-up campaign in England in response to local measles outbreaks. From 1 April 2014, patients aged between 16-18, who have no record of vaccination and who self-present to practices requesting vaccination, were offered the vaccine. There remains a catch-up programme in place in Wales as a result of severe outbreak of measles.\nApart from the more routine vaccination of children as above, there are also target groups worthy of special mention. The immunisation can be given to individuals of any age. The decision on whether or not to vaccinate should take into account:\nPast immunisation history.\nThe likelihood of an individual remaining susceptible.\nThe future risk of exposure and disease.\nThese children should be specifically contacted rather than left to the routine recall procedure:\nPremature babies should be immunised after two months, irrespective of prematurity.\nHIV-positive individuals. Severely immunocompromised patients should not be given the vaccine but it is indicated for patients with mild-to-moderate immunosuppression. The degree of immunosuppression is estimated using the patient's age and CD4 count. A specialist should be involved in the decision to vaccinate.\nWomen of childbearing age who are seronegative for rubella and who are not currently pregnant, should be given the vaccine.\nHealthcare workers - should be given the vaccine for their own benefit and to protect vulnerable unimmunised patients and their own unimmunised partners.\nUnimmunised seronegative postpartum women should be offered the vaccine a few days after delivery.\nChildren arriving from developing countries after school age of immunisation are particularly likely to require immunisation.\nThe vaccine should be given to susceptible children aged over 6 months in contact with a case, within three days of exposure.\nThese children should still have routine MMR at the usual age.\nNote that MMR vaccination is not suitable for prophylaxis against mumps or rubella following exposure to either, as the antibody response is too slow.\nAcute illness (postpone until the condition has resolved) but note that minor illness without fever or systemic upset - eg, mild otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and diarrhoea - is not a contra-indication.\nSevere local or generalised reaction to a previous dose of MMR vaccine - when in doubt, seek specialist advice.\nAllergy to neomycin or gelatin.\nUntreated malignant disease or impaired immunity - eg, immunosuppression, steroids, radiotherapy, cytotoxic drugs or within six months of receiving such treatment. (Immunisation can still be possible in some circumstances depending on dosage and combination of drugs - check with the specialist treating the condition or the local community paediatrician.)\nWithin three months of receiving blood products, such as immunoglobulin.\nIf immediate protection against measles is required in someone who has recently received a blood product, MMR vaccine should still be given. To confer longer-term protection, MMR should then be repeated after three months.\nPregnancy - but note that the Department of Health does not recommend termination, as studies failed to demonstrate a link between rubella immunisation in early pregnancy and fetal damage.\nNote that the following are NOT contra-indications:\nFamily history of any adverse reactions following immunisation.\nPrevious history of infection with pertussis, measles, rubella or mumps.\nContact with an infectious disease.\nAsthma, eczema, hay fever or rhinitis.\nTreatment with antibiotics or locally acting (eg, topical or inhaled) steroids.\nThe child's mother being pregnant.\nThe child being breast-fed.\nHistory of jaundice after birth.\nBeing over the age recommended in the immunisation schedule.\n'Replacement' corticosteroids.\nAllergy to eggs (recent research has found no link between allergy to dietary eggs and anaphylactic reactions to MMR vaccine).\nNeurological conditions are not a contra-indication although, if the condition is poorly controlled (eg, epilepsy), immunisation should be deferred.\nMMR should ideally be given at the same time as other live vaccines, such as BCG. However, if live vaccines cannot be administered simultaneously, a four-week interval is recommended.\nAdverse reactions are considerably less common after a second dose of MMR vaccine than after the first dose.\nFever or a rash may occur one week after immunisation. It lasts 2-3 days and is more common after the first immunisation than after the second.\nParotid swelling occurs in 1% of children of all ages up to 4 years. It is most common at the third week, occasionally later.\nFebrile convulsion may occur on the 6th-11th day after immunisation . The incidence is 1 in 1,000 children. This is less than the incidence after an infection of measles. There is no evidence that epilepsy occurs more frequently after febrile convulsion caused by MMR than after any other febrile convulsion.\nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura occurs in 1 in 24,000 children, usually within six weeks of the first dose. The child should undergo serological testing before the next dose is given. This is offered free by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) Virus Reference Laboratory.\nArthropathy (arthralgia or arthritis) has also been reported to occur rarely after MMR immunisation, probably due to the rubella component. It occurs between 14 and 21 days after immunisation.\nThere is overwhelming evidence that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism or bowel disease.[2]\u00c2\u00a0Some private clinics offer single vaccines but the Department of Health recommends that parents be discouraged from using them.[3]\u00c2\u00a0 One study identified four cases of anaphylaxis following single component measles or rubella vaccine.[4]\nMMR the facts; Dept of Health\nDisclaimer: This article is for information only and should not be used for the diagnosis or treatment of medical conditions.

Nearly all deaths from rabies in humans worldwide result from the bite of a rabid dog.\nIn the UK, deaths from classical rabies continue to occur in people infected abroad. However, it is rare with only 25 deaths since 1946. No indigenous cases have been reported in the UK other than from bats since 1902, and only one of these has been reported.[1] Worldwide, however, it is a vast problem with over 60,000 deaths each year.\nEffective immunisation is available and schedules have been developed for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis. There is no specific treatment for rabies, and death is almost inevitable once the clinical features present.\nInfection results in encephalomyelitis.\nThe incubation period is usually 3-12 weeks but the range is 4 days to 19 years.\nOnset is insidious - wound paraesthesia, headache, fever, malaise.\nProgression is to hydrophobia, hallucinations, paralysis and coma.\nDeath results from respiratory paralysis.\nFor further information, see the separate article Rabies.\nCurrently cell-culture derived vaccines are used. There are two licensed for use in the UK:\nHuman diploid cell vaccine (HDCV), or Rabies Vaccine BP.\nPurified chick embryo cell (PCEC) rabies vaccine, or Rabipur\u00c2\u00ae.\nThese vaccines are freeze-dried, inactivated and contain traces of neomycin. They should be stored at 2-8\u00c2\u00b0C and discarded if unused one hour after reconstitution. Administration is usually intramuscular in the deltoid region. They can be used interchangeably. Other cell culture-derived vaccines are available elsewhere in the world, which are World Health Organization (WHO) approved.\nEach dose, for both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis is 1 ml (2.5 IU) of rabies vaccine, when given by the intramuscular route.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommends the intramuscular rather than the intradermal route for rabies vaccine. The use of the intradermal route is not covered by the manufacturers' product licence and, if it is used, becomes the doctor's own responsibility.\nHuman rabies-specific immunoglobulin (HRIG) is available and is derived from the plasma of immunised human donors for passive immunisation. This is sourced from outside the UK due to the theoretical risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) from plasma products.\nHRIG is used after high-risk exposure to rabies and is given at the same time as rabies vaccine (at a different site) to give rapid protection until the rabies vaccine becomes effective. It is infiltrated in and around the cleansed wound, or intramuscularly into the antero-lateral thigh.\u00c2\u00a0 It can be given for up to seven days after starting the vaccination course (active immunisation). The dose is HRIG 20 IU\/kg body weight.\nIt should be stored at 2-8\u00c2\u00b0C.\nThis is available free on the NHS to:\nLaboratory workers handling the virus.\nWorkers handling imported animals.\nAny handlers of species of bats.\nAnimal control and wildlife workers, veterinary staff or zoologists who travel regularly in rabies-enzootic areas.\nHealth workers in rabies-enzootic areas who will be at risk of direct exposure to body fluids or tissue from a patient with confirmed or probable rabies.\nThis does NOT include veterinary practice staff, unless they regularly handle bats or regularly handle imported animals in animal quarantine centres, zoos or ports.[3]\u00c2\u00a0\nIt is also recommended, but not free on the NHS, to travellers to high-risk areas:\nWho are staying for more than one month\nWho are engaging in higher-risk activities, such as cycling or running\nWhere there is limited access to medical care and particularly to easy post-exposure prophylaxis\nUp-to-date information on specific countries can be found on the NaTHNaC website, the PHE website and the Health Protection Scotland website (Travax and fitfortravel).[4][5][6] Children are thought to have a higher risk as they are more likely to approach animals without caution. Essentially the decision to vaccinate results from an individual risk assessment based on the duration of stay, the likelihood of engagement in at-risk activities, the age of the traveller, the rabies endemicity and access to appropriate medical care in the country of destination.[7]\u00c2\u00a0\nPrimary, pre-exposure protection: give three doses, 1 mL - intramuscular deltoid region - at days 0, 7 and 28. The third dose can be given on day 21 if time is limited.\nA single reinforcing dose is then given, one year after the primary course has been completed, to those at regular risk. In this category of at-risk individuals, boosters at 3- to 5-yearly intervals based on serology should be considered.\nFor those who are travelling again to a high-risk area, a booster dose can be considered at ten years after the primary course has been completed.\nSerological testing is only advised for those at continuous or frequent risk:\nIn those who work with the live virus, antibodies should be tested every six months. Those people with low levels of antibodies should be given a reinforcing dose of vaccine as necessary to maintain their immune status. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently considers a minimal acceptable antibody titre to be 0.5 IU\/mL.\nIn those at frequent risk, who have had a booster after one year, serology every 3-5 years should be considered, and boosters given where needed.\nPost-exposure prophylaxis is nearly 100% effective at preventing rabies.\nThe schedule used depends on:\nLevel of risk (low, medium or high) in the country.\nType of exposure (history of the animal\/stray, likelihood of infection, etc).\nThe individual's immunity (details of previous vaccinations, if any).\nIf possible, expert advice on the appropriate management and schedule should be sought with this outline of information from:\nIn England, the Public Health England (PHE) Virus Reference Department, Colindale, London (Tel: 0208 327 6204 or out of hours 020 8200 4400).\nIn Wales, the duty virologist, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff (029 20 747 747).\nIn Scotland, the local infectious diseases consultant (see the Green Book).[8]\u00c2\u00a0\nIn Northern Ireland, the regional virology service or the Public Health Agency Duty Room (see the Green Book.)\nClean the wound with soap or detergent under running tap water for several minutes. Then treat with a suitable disinfectant (eg, 40-70% alcohol, povidone iodine). Prompt wound care significantly reduces the risk of developing rabies.\nPrimary suturing of the wound should be avoided or postponed.\nInformation gathering for risk assessment:[9]\u00c2\u00a0\nAnimal involved - species, state of health, vaccination status, name and address of the animal's owner where possible to allow follow-up. This may require enlistment of help from local officials.\nType and site of injury.\nCountry where bite occurred. Local medical advice may be helpful. They are likely to know the level of risk locally and be able to advise on the need for vaccination.\nDate of exposure. As the incubation period for rabies can be prolonged, treatment should still be considered even if the interval from exposure is lengthy.\nVaccination history of individual exposed.\nThe following is a summary of the full algorithm which is available on the PHE website, which also contains the logistics of obtaining HRIG and vaccines, and advice on finishing post-exposure treatment courses which were initiated abroad.\nRabies vaccine may cause local reactions such as redness, swelling or pain at the site of injection within 24-48 hours of administration.\nSystemic reactions, such as headache, fever, muscle aches, vomiting and urticarial rashes, are rare.\nReactions may become more severe with repeated doses.\nHRIG may cause local pain and low-grade fever but no serious adverse reactions have been reported.\nIn the event of a hypersensitivity reaction to a dose of a pre-exposure course, these patients should still receive post-exposure vaccination if indicated, because the risks of rabies outweigh the risks of hypersensitivity.\nWhen a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during post-exposure immunisation, further doses should be given under close medical supervision.\nPregnant women and breast-feeding mothers should only be given pre-exposure vaccination if the risk of exposure to rabies is high and rapid access to post-exposure prophylaxis would be limited.\nPost-exposure treatment should be given to pregnant women when indicated.\nIndividuals with immunosuppression and HIV infection (regardless of CD4 count) should be given rabies vaccines in accordance with the recommendations above. Antibody response may be inadequate. If exposed to rabies, individuals who are immunosuppressed or who have HIV may require a different regime for post-exposure management. Specialist advice should then be sought urgently.\nRabies Vaccine BP is available from Sanofi Pasteur MSD (Tel: 0800 085 5511).\nRabipur\u00c2\u00ae is available from Novartis Vaccines (Tel: 08457 451500) or MASTA (Tel: 0113 238 7500).\nPre-exposure vaccination in England and Wales for individuals at high occupational risk is supplied by the Department of Health, and should be obtained from PHE Virus Reference Department in Colindale. For others it is obtained from pharmacies via private prescription.\nFor post-exposure vaccine and HRIG in England, supplies are available from Colindale on completion of a risk assessment form which acts as a prescription.[9] For advice on supply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, see the contact details in the post-exposure recommendations section above. For post-exposure prophylaxis, vaccine and HRIG are available free of charge in the NHS.\nDisclaimer: This article is for information only and should not be used for the diagnosis or treatment of medical conditions.

You should be immunised against typhoid before you travel to certain countries where the risk of typhoid is high - in particular, countries in the Indian subcontinent. There are two typhoid vaccines available in the UK - an oral and an injectable vaccine.\nTyphoid fever is caused by a germ (bacterium) called Salmonella typhi (S. typhi). This bacterium may contaminate food or drink in areas of poor sanitation. Typhoid ranges from being a mild illness to a fatal one. Symptoms include sudden onset of:\nHigh temperature (fever).\nSevere headache.\nFeeling sick (nausea).\nTummy (abdominal) pain.\nLoss of appetite.\nConstipation or diarrhoea.\nThese symptoms can be very severe.\n(Note: there are many types of salmonella bacteria which can infect people. Most remain in the gut and cause diarrhoea. S. typhi is more invasive - it can get from the gut into other parts of the body and it causes the more serious illness of typhoid fever.)\nPeople with typhoid fever pass out the bacteria with their stools (faeces), and sometimes in their urine. Even when symptoms have gone, about 1 in 10 people who have had typhoid fever remain carriers for some time. This means that some bacteria continue to live inside the gut and you continue to pass out bacteria with your faeces. If hygiene is not good then the bacteria can be passed to others who may then get typhoid fever. About half of carriers become free of the typhoid bacteria within three month. However, others continue to pass out typhoid bacteria with their faeces long-term.\nThe incubation period for the disease is usually 1-3 weeks. This means that you do not get symptoms for 1-3 weeks after becoming infected. Around 200 cases are notified in the UK each year. About 8 in 10 of these cases are in people who caught the infection abroad, and most of these were visiting friends or relatives in South Asia. Typhoid infection can be successfully treated with antibiotic medicines, which reduce the chances of serious illness.\nTravellers to areas where typhoid is a problem should be immunised, particularly where hygiene and sanitation are poor. The worst affected areas are Asia, Africa, and Central and South America, so you should be immunised if visiting these countries, especially if you are visiting friends and relatives. Immunisation may not be needed for short stays if you stay in good accommodation (including most package holidays). Your GP or practice nurse can advise if you should be immunised against typhoid for your travel destination.\nPeople who handle specimens which may contain typhoid germs (bacteria) should also be immunised.\nThere are two vaccines available in the UK - an oral vaccine and an injectable vaccine. Both vaccines stimulate your body to make antibodies against typhoid germs (bacteria). These antibodies protect you from illness should you become infected with typhoid bacteria. It is important to remember that not everyone who is vaccinated will be totally protected against typhoid fever. No vaccine is 100% effective.\nThe oral vaccine is given as three capsules, one taken every other day. The capsules should be kept refrigerated. Each capsule should be taken with cold or lukewarm liquid (no warmer than 37oC), approximately one hour before a meal. It should be swallowed whole as soon as possible after being placed in the mouth, and not chewed. The oral vaccine should be completed one week before you travel, as protection takes at least seven days to begin. This oral vaccine should only be given to children over 6 years of age. Antibiotics and some malaria tablets can stop the oral vaccine working. Most malaria tablets should not be taken for at least three days after receiving the oral vaccine. Your nurse will be able to advise you further about this.\nThe injectable vaccine is given as a single injection into your upper arm or thigh. It should be given at least two weeks before you travel, ideally one month before.\nRe-vaccination is needed eventually as the protective effect of the vaccines fades over time. A booster dose is recommended every three years for the injection and every year (with three capsules) of the oral vaccine for those still at risk. It is important to keep a record of which vaccinations you have, and when and where you have them.\nA combined vaccine against typhoid fever and hepatitis A is also available. This may be useful if you require protection against both illnesses. The hepatitis A component gives protection for one year and the typhoid component gives protection for three years.\nMild local soreness and redness may occur after the injection for a few days. Fever can occur in about 1 in 100 people. Following oral vaccine, the most common side-effects are feeling sick (nausea), diarrhoea, high temperature (fever) and headache. Serious reactions are very rare for both vaccines.\nVery few people cannot be given the injectable typhoid vaccine. It should not be given to:\nPeople with an illness with high temperature (fever). It is best to wait until the illness has subsided before being immunised.\nPeople who have had a severe (anaphylactic) reaction to the vaccine in the past.\nWhen children are too young to be vaccinated, very careful attention to food and water hygiene is essential if taking children to an at-risk area.\nThere are currently no data on the safety of these vaccines in pregnant or breast-feeding women. However, if the risk of typhoid is high then you may be advised to have the vaccine if you are breast-feeding or pregnant.\nThere are some additional restrictions that apply differently to the oral vaccine and to the injectable vaccine.\nThe oral vaccine should not be given to:\nPeople who have had an allergy to gelatin.\nChildren under the age of 6 years.\nPeople who have reduced immunity (people with HIV, those taking high-dose long-term steroids, those receiving chemotherapy, etc).\nThe injectable vaccine should not be given to:\nChildren under 2 years of age, as it is not licensed for them. This means that the manufacturer cannot offer guarantees about its effects or effectiveness in that age group. Children under the age of 2 years may not acquire the same level of immunity from the vaccine, due to the immaturity of their immune systems.\nNote: doctors may occasionally recommend injectable vaccine use in children aged 12-24 months if the risk of typhoid is very high.\u00c2\u00a0\nRemember - immunisation for travellers is only one aspect of preventing illness. Both typhoid vaccines are only about 75% effective, particularly if you are exposed to large numbers of typhoid germs (bacteria).\nSafety in pregnancy is not known but there is no reason to believe the vaccine risks harm to the mother or baby, so it is used if travel is essential and the risk of typhoid is high.\nSo, when you travel to at-risk areas you should:\nHave good personal hygiene.\nOnly drink water or other drinks that are known to be safe (bottled water, sterilised water, etc).\nOnly eat foods that have been cleaned and\/or prepared properly.\nPatient is one of the most trusted medical resources online, supplying evidence based information on a wide range of medical and health topics to patients and health professionals.\n","183":"You should consider immunisation against hepatitis A before you travel to certain countries, such as the Indian subcontinent. Check with your practice nurse at least two weeks before you travel to see if you should have this immunisation.\nHepatitis A is an illness caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus mainly causes inflammation of the liver. Symptoms include:\nGenerally feeling unwell.\nYellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice).\nSometimes, being sick (vomiting).\nA raised temperature (fever).\nHowever, some people who are infected do not develop any symptoms (a subclinical illness). The illness is not usually serious and full recovery is usual but the symptoms can be quite unpleasant for a while. The hepatitis A virus is passed out in the stools (faeces) of infected people and infection is usually spread by eating dirty (contaminated) food or drink.\nHepatitis A infection can occur in the UK but it is more common in countries where there is poor sanitation or where disposal of sewage is poor. In the UK, most cases of hepatitis A are seen in people who have recently returned after travelling to such countries. If you catch hepatitis A, the illness is not usually serious but it may ruin a holiday or business trip. See separate leaflet called Hepatitis A for more details.\nThis leaflet is just about immunisation to help prevent hepatitis A infection.\nTravellers to countries outside Western Europe, North America and Australasia should consider being immunised. The highest-risk areas include the Indian subcontinent (in particular India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal), Africa, parts of the Far East (except Japan), South and Central America and the Middle East. Immunisation is generally recommended for anyone over the age of 1 year. Your doctor or practice nurse can advise if you should be immunised against hepatitis A for your travel destination.\nClose contacts of someone with hepatitis A. Occasional outbreaks of hepatitis A occur in the UK within families or in institutions. Close contacts of someone found to have hepatitis A infection (for example, family members or other members of the institution) may be offered immunisation. This only happens rarely. The most important measure for anybody with hepatitis A is good personal hygiene. In particular, washing hands after going to the toilet or before eating.\nPeople with chronic liver disease. If you have a persistent (chronic) liver disease (for example, cirrhosis) it is suggested that you have the hepatitis A vaccine. Hepatitis A infection is not more common in those with chronic liver disease but, if infection does occur, it can cause a more serious illness.\nPeople exposed to hepatitis A at work. For example, laboratory workers who are exposed to hepatitis A during their work and sewage workers are advised to be immunised against hepatitis A.\nStaff of some large residential institutions. Outbreaks of hepatitis A have been associated with large residential institutions for people with learning difficulties, where standards of personal hygiene among clients or patients may be poor. Therefore, immunisation of staff and residents of some institutions may be recommended.\nInjecting drug users who share drug injecting equipment are also thought to have an increased risk of hepatitis A infection and so should consider immunisation.\nPeople with certain blood clotting problems\u00c2\u00a0(such as haemophilia) who need to receive blood clotting factors, may have an increased risk of hepatitis A infection. This is because the hepatitis A virus may not be completely destroyed during the preparation of these blood products. Immunisation is therefore suggested for these people.\nMen who have sex with men, and other people whose sexual practices involve oral-anal contact, may also like to consider immunisation against hepatitis A.\nNote: if you have been infected with hepatitis A in the past, you should be immune to further infection and therefore not need immunisation. A blood test can detect antibodies to check if you are already immune. This may be worthwhile doing if you have had a history of yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) or come from an area where hepatitis A is common.\nThere are a number of different hepatitis A vaccines available. There are also some combined vaccines for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B and also hepatitis A and typhoid fever. A combined vaccine may be useful if you require protection against both diseases.\nThe hepatitis A single vaccine is given as two doses. The first dose of the vaccine protects against hepatitis A for about one year. The vaccine causes your body to make antibodies against the virus. These antibodies protect you from illness should you become infected with this virus. Ideally, you should have an injection at least two weeks before travel to allow immunity to develop. However, the vaccine may still be advised even if there is less than two weeks before you travel.\nA second dose of the vaccine 6-12 months after the first gives protection for about 20 years. If you are late with this second dose, you should have it as soon as possible but you don't need to start with the first dose again. Another booster dose of hepatitis A vaccine after 20 years can be given to those people still at risk of infection.\nThe doses of the combined vaccines against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B or hepatitis A and typhoid may need to be given at slightly different time intervals. Your doctor or practice nurse will be able to advise you in detail.\nSome people develop a temporary soreness and redness at the injection site. Much less common are:\nA mild raised temperature (fever).\nFeeling sick (nauseated).\nFeeling off your food for a few days.\nSevere reactions are extremely rare.\nThere are a very few situations where the hepatitis A vaccine is not recommended. They include:\nIf you have an illness causing a high temperature. In this situation, it is best to postpone immunisation until after you have fully recovered from the illness.\nIf you have had an allergic reaction to the vaccine or to any of its components in the past.\nOne type of vaccine (Epaxal\u00c2\u00ae) should not be given to anyone who is known to be allergic to eggs.\nChildren under the age of 1 year. However, the risk of hepatitis A in children under the age of 1 year is very low. The hepatitis A vaccine is not licensed for this age group.\nThe vaccine may be given if you are pregnant or breast-feeding and immunisation against hepatitis A is thought to be necessary.\nRemember - immunisation for travellers is only one aspect of preventing illness. No immunisation is 100% effective. So when travelling to at-risk areas, you should have very good personal hygiene and also be careful about what you eat and drink.\nYou should avoid eating and drinking the following when travelling to areas where the risk of hepatitis A is higher:\nRaw or inadequately cooked shellfish.\nRaw salads and vegetables that may have been washed in unclean (contaminated) water. (Wash fruit and vegetables in safe water and peel them yourself.)\nOther foods that may have been grown close to the ground, such as strawberries.\nUntreated drinking water, including ice cubes made from untreated water. (Remember also to use only treated or bottled water when brushing your teeth.)\nUnpasteurised milk, cheese, ice cream and other dairy products.\nAlso, be careful when buying food from street traders. Make sure that food has been recently prepared and that it is served hot and on clean serving plates. Food that has been left out at room temperature (for example, for a buffet) or food that may have been exposed to flies could also pose a risk.\nPatient is one of the most trusted medical resources online, supplying evidence based information on a wide range of medical and health topics to patients and health professionals.\n","184":"All children and adults should be immunised against tetanus. See your practice nurse if you think that you are not fully immunised.\nTetanus is an infection caused by a germ (bacterium) called Clostridium tetani which can attack the muscles and nervous system. Tetanus is a serious infection which can even be fatal. Tetanus germs (bacteria) live in the soil and dirt. The bacteria may get into your body through a cut or a wound in the skin. The bacteria make a poison (toxin) which causes the illness.\nEven small wounds such as a prick from a thorn can allow enough bacteria to get into the body to cause tetanus. The illness usually takes 7-8 days to develop but can vary from one day to two months. Therefore, you may have forgotten about a small cut before the illness starts.\nTetanus in the UK is extremely uncommon. Most cases occur in people over the age of 65 years who have not been immunised against tetanus, as the immunisation was only routinely introduced in 1961. In 2013 there were only seven cases of tetanus in the UK. Tetanus is largely a disease of the developing world and the poor, where there is inadequate vaccination.\nTetanus vaccine is actually given as a combination vaccine with other vaccines. There are three types of combination vaccine:\nFor young children the pre-school booster is normally part of the combined diphtheria\/tetanus\/acellular whooping cough (pertussis)\/inactivated polio vaccine (DTaP\/IPV or dTaP\/IPV).\nFor adults and teenagers who receive tetanus immunisation, a combined tetanus, diphtheria\/inactivated polio vaccine (Td\/IPV) is normally used.\nThe vaccine stimulates your body to make antibodies against the tetanus toxin. These antibodies protect you from illness should you become infected with tetanus.\nAll children are offered tetanus immunisation as part of the routine immunisation programme. A full course of tetanus immunisation consists of five doses of vaccine as follows:\n\u00c2\u00a0 Children aged under 10 years Children aged over 10 years and adults (who have not been immunised as a child) \nPrimary course Three doses of vaccine - as DTaP\/IPV(polio)\/Hib at 2, 3 and 4 months of age. Three doses of vaccine - as Td\/IPV(polio), each one month apart. \n4th dose Three years after the primary course - as part of the DTaP\/IPV(polio) pre-school booster at 3 years and 4 months to 5 years. Five years after the primary course - as Td\/IPV(polio). \n5th dose Aged 13-18 years - the school leaver booster - as Td\/IPV(polio). 10 years after 4th dose - as Td\/IPV(polio). \nThe primary course of three injections gives good protection for a number of years. The fourth and fifth doses (boosters) maintain protection. After the fifth dose, immunity remains for life and you do not need any further boosters (apart from some travel situations - see 'I am going abroad', below).\nSome adults have not been fully immunised against tetanus because routine immunisation for children was not introduced until 1961. Men serving in the armed forces from 1938 onwards were offered tetanus immunisation. So, some older people may still be at risk.\nSee your practice nurse if you think that you are not fully immunised against tetanus (that is - if you have not had five injections in total). The course does not need to be started again if an injection is delayed. A late injection is sufficient to catch up, even if you have it years after it was due.\nIf you are not immunised or up-to-date with boosters then an injection of vaccine is usually advised.\nIf you are up-to-date with tetanus immunisations then you do not need a tetanus vaccine.\nIf your wound or injury is considered to be high risk for tetanus (for example, where there has been significant contact with soil or manure) then an injection of human tetanus immunoglobulin is usually given, regardless of whether your have been immunised against tetanus or not. This gives extra protection against tetanus.\nUsually not if you are up to date with your immunisations. However, if you are to travel to areas where medical attention may not be available then a dose of vaccine may be advised. This is even if you have had five previous injections. In particular, if it has been more than 10 years since your last injection. This is a precautionary measure in case you have a very dirty wound and do not receive antiserum. Your doctor or practice nurse will advise you further about this.\nIt is common to get a little redness and swelling around the injection site, which goes after a few days. Some people feel slightly unwell for a day or so, with a mild headache, slight aching of the muscles and a mild high temperature (fever). Severe reactions are extremely rare.\nIf you are unwell with an illness causing a high temperature (fever), it is wise to postpone an injection until the illness has gone (except if the dose is needed after a cut or wound). Also, you should not have another injection of vaccine if a previous injection caused a severe reaction. The tetanus vaccine is safe if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\nDisclaimer: This article is for information only and should not be used for the diagnosis or treatment of medical conditions.

Among the 51 measles cases linked directly to Disneyland, six of the people had received their measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIt should come as little surprise when the unvaccinated get sick with the measles. As viruses go, this one packs a mighty punch. Nine of out 10 unvaccinated people exposed to the measles virus will get the measles.  That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a whopping 90 percent.\nBut why hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the vaccine protected these six people who had been vaccinated?  \nHere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the thing. The MMR vaccine is very effective, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not 100 percent preventative. Some people who get the vaccine are still at risk of contracting the disease. Large numbers of vaccinated people act as a firewall that prevent the disease from spreading to those who are vulnerable. The vaccinated protect the unvaccinated. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But as more people opt not to get vaccinated, or not to get their children vaccinated, the virus has more portals to creep through, more people to infect.  And those people sneeze and cough, releasing the virus into the air, and that fuels the spread of the disease. \nSome parents opt out of the MMR vaccine, often due to thoroughly discredited studies that link it to autism. Simply put, if everyone got the vaccine, the virus would have nowhere to go. The unvaccinated keep the measles alive.\nBut let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back up. The MMR vaccine works by introducing tiny live amounts of the three viruses \u00e2\u20ac\u201d measles, mumps and rubella \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to provoke an immune response in the body that serves as a lifelong protective shield. It comes in two doses. Typically the first is administered at 12 months and the second at 4 or 5 years old. The first dose provides 95 percent protection. But 5 percent of patients have immune systems that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond to these antibodies. The second kindergarten-age dose bolsters the coverage to 99 percent. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153But you still have 1 percent of people who have two doses of the vaccine who we call non-responders,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Patsy Stinchfield, director of Infection Prevention and Control and the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Immunization Project at Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota.\nThink about it this way.  Say there was a massive measles outbreak, and 1 million people were infected. Roughly 10,000 of those people who had received both doses would still get sick. \nIn the case of the Disneyland outbreak, four of the measles patients had received the full two doses; two had received only one dose. \nAt especially high risk for the measles are infants between the ages of six and 12 months, who are too young to get the vaccine.  Maternal antibodies that cross the placenta protect the child for the first few months of life.  But as the baby gets bigger, that protection fades.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Between six and 12 months, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get that maternal antibody protection, and you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had the vaccine, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in this valley of vulnerable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stinchfield said.\nAnd there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another group that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at an extremely high risk of developing life-threatening measles pneumonia: people with already weakened immune systems. \nConsider this case.\nLaura Bredesen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son Ben was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in June 2010.  He was 2. For more than three years, he underwent daily chemotherapy and frequent steroids, treatment that left his immune system compromised and extremely vulnerable to any virus. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every minor illness,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd his mother wrote,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had the potential to balloon into a more complicated condition requiring additional treatments.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIn March 2011, Ben was potentially exposed to the measles by an unvaccinated 2-year-old while in the hospital for a routine spinal tap treatment. He had received his first dose of the MMR vaccine, but was too young for the second, and doctors feared his chemotherapy, which kills cancer cells but can also impact immune memory cells, had weakened his protection to the virus. The chemotherapy, in other words, had made Ben vulnerable to diseases he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been vaccinated against.\nWhat followed, Bredesen said, were the scariest three weeks of her family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life. Ben\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s muscles were injected with eight painful shots of immune globulin to boost his immune system, after which his legs were so sore he temporarily couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk, and he was isolated at home to protect others for nearly three weeks. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Ben had come down with the measles, his chances wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been good,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bredesen said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He would have been fighting for his life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd    \nBen, now 7, never contracted the measles and is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doing wonderfully now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd his mother reports. But she remembers that time as being the most \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mentally painful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of his treatment.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those 3.5 years were incredibly hard,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bredesen said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But those 21 days were the most challenging of our lives.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAmong the viruses that commonly make news \u00e2\u20ac\u201d enterovirus 68, Ebola, influenza and measles \u00e2\u20ac\u201d measles ranks far and away the most contagious, Stinchfield said. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get Ebola in a subway, in a school, at a daycare or in a train station, but you can get the measles in all those places,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It stays airborne for two hours after someone walks through that train station. That means everyone who walks through the airspace will be exposed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAnd while most patients recover fully, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is a disease that needs to be taken very seriously,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Dr. Eric Handler, the health officer in Orange County, where 23 of the cases have been reported this year. Of the 23, six were children, five of them unimmunized, he said.  \nMeasles often starts with cold symptoms: a runny nose and watery eyes that can turn to conjunctivitis, or pink eye. Symptoms typically progress to a cough, fever and a rash. Most people are in bed, miserable, for a week and then recover. In most cases, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a manageable illness. But about 1 in 20 people with measles will get pneumonia and likely be hospitalized. And 1 in 1,000 measles cases will advance to encephalitis, a dangerous swelling of the brain.\nOf the encephalitis cases, Stinchfield said, a very high percentage \u00e2\u20ac\u201d about two-thirds \u00e2\u20ac\u201d have permanent impairment, whether that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brain damage, developmental delays, blindness or deafness. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They go home a different person,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.  \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153What you have to understand is really even one case is considered a public health emergency because of how contagious measles is,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stinchfield said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It only takes a small community of unimmunized for the virus to take hold and spread.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n","186":"I must be nuts to tackle this subject. It is so controversial. But I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important for people with pets\u00c2\u00a0to be educated on the subject and to know that you, as a pet guardian, have many options.\nWhy do some people believe the veterinary profession has been guilty of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153over-vaccinating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the past? Most probably because this was true. But safe vaccinations and vaccination protocols for your cats and dogs do not have a very long history when you think about it, and vaccine protocols are always evolving and changing depending on changing diseases and the pet population.\nThink about vaccines in 3\u00c2\u00a0categories:\nI recommend that you follow your state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regulations on rabies vaccination. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the law. Rabies vaccines are very safe, inexpensive and given infrequently if you follow the guidelines. If your animal is bitten or bites someone and is not up-to-date on rabies, your animal will be placed under quarantine.\nJust recently in my bucolic town of Amherst, Mass., there lived a happy sheep on the common ground of a communal living housing development. A friend of mine thought the sheep was doing some strange wandering, so she helped it with its feed and water buckets. Next day, Mary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little lamb was salivating, circling and, you guessed it, dead from rabies.\nEveryone in the community who had come into any contact with said sheep had to get rabies vaccines. This example is to remind us that rabies is out there!\nAs the animal inspector in my town, I was perturbed a few years ago when the police brought me a dead raccoon late at night. Rocky had apparently been bothering a neighbor, so the police shot him and brought him to me.\nBecause there had been potential human contact, I was required to cut off his head and get it to the state ASAP. This being my first raccoon decapitation, I found it a bit more difficult than first anticipated. I cut myself with the blood-laden scalpel trying to cut through that last vertebrae.\nWouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you know poor Rocky had been bothering that neighbor because he was rabid! I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it when the state report came back the next day. Luckily, I have pre-exposure rabies vaccinations, but this stupid accident on my part did require that I go to an after-hours facility and receive a post-exposure rabies booster.\nI was reminded that vaccines serve a wonderful purpose. It brought back the unpleasant memory of the video we were required to watch in vet school of a person dying of rabies. This made the lasting impression that rabies is still around and is fatal.\nWhat about the basic canine and feline vaccinations your veterinarian might recommend that your pet get every few years? We used to recommend these be given annually, and now we recommend they be given approximately every 3\u00c2\u00a0years.\nWhy the change? Vaccination protocols were set in the late 1940s and \u00e2\u20ac\u212250s to vaccinate yearly for fatal diseases like distemper.\nStudies showed that one-third of puppies were not protected after a year, so the yearly protocol was instituted. The vaccine was less expensive to give than trying to test titres to see if the pet was still protected, so annual vaccination became the standard of care.\nOver the next 40 years, vaccination became widespread and the diseases became controlled. It has become obvious that less vaccination is sufficient for adequate protection.\nYou may ask your veterinarian to run titres that are available for certain diseases like distemper and parvo if you want to give the fewest vaccinations possible. A titre is a blood test that determines whether your animal is still protected by a previous vaccine.\nMany veterinary vaccines on the market don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00c2\u00a0have to be given to animals who are not at specific risk.\nA simple example is the bordetella, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kennel cough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vaccine for dogs. Only dogs who board in a kennel facility are required to have this vaccine.\nThat being said, your dog can contract bordetella on the street, in a dog park, in the veterinarian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office, etc. The risk is simply higher in a kennel where there are lots of dogs under one roof. Talk to your vet and decide if your dog should get this protection based on potential exposure.\nHolistic or Traditional Medicine\nSome veterinarians and pet owners who take a completely homeopathic or holistic approach to medicine think vaccines lower your pet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system or cause disease.\nThey advocate giving very few or no vaccines at all. Traditional medicine advocates that vaccines be given to ensure that an animal is protected against serious and fatal diseases, taking into account the potential risks of vaccination.\nMany of you have probably experienced a time when your pet was lethargic, even possibly running a low-grade fever after a vaccination. Occasionally, a pet has a true anaphylactic reaction and the face or body swells, hives develop, etc.\nThese are considered vaccine reactions and must be readily dealt with. This is different from the concerns of holistic medicine, where the belief is vaccination can do continual harm to the pet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall health.\nHerd immunity is a level of immunity when a significant amount of a population is vaccinated to protect the entire population. This applies to animals and humans.\nIf enough of the population is not vaccinated, vaccine-preventable diseases will begin to occur, as has happened with childhood diseases because of parents who decline vaccination. In 2009 we saw a rise in measles, mumps and pertussis (whooping cough) because too many children were not vaccinated.\nIn the late 1980s, when I was still in vet school, the University of Pennsylvania had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Parvo Ward,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd populated with pathetic dying puppies and dogs. Loaded up with IVs and monitors, medications being pumped into their little bodies, they suffered for days and often died.\nMany clients could not afford the treatment. Now parvo is happily a rare disease. But when pet owners decide that vaccination is not essential, the overall population is at greater risk and more cases are seen.\nBoth parvo and distemper are rarely seen in the vaccinated population today. But these diseases are not eradicated. In areas of the country where dogs and cats are unvaccinated and the conditions are right for transmission (usually warmer climates), these deadly diseases are still seen regularly.\nAs a responsible pet guardian, you should think of your approach to vaccination as holistic but not selfish. Consider the overall health of your pet, plus the risk factors, and go from there.\nDiscuss vaccine protocols with your\u00c2\u00a0veterinarian. Vaccine clinics or going to a mega pet store for vaccines may not be helping you or saving you money in the long run.\nWhenever I see a receipt from clients who went to a vaccine clinic or corporate veterinarian for their vaccines, I believe they have often paid for\u00c2\u00a0unnecessary vaccines. If the veterinarian has not discussed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153core\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd versus other vaccines with you, he or she has done you a disservice.\nDon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153bundled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vaccines. Vaccinations should not be picked from a shopping list. You need to discuss pros and cons and tailor a health plan for your pet with your vet. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to be able to do this in a vaccine line at a Luv-My-Pup-Pup, where they do not love your pup \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they love your money.\nTake the Lyme vaccine, for example, one of the most controversial vaccines. Lyme is not a big problem in some parts of the country, and the vaccine is not 100 percent protective. So why would you get your maltese who lives in a non-endemic area and spends 80 percent of its time in an air-conditioned room a Lyme vaccine?\nBut maybe you have\u00c2\u00a0a Labrador in the Northeast, an endemic Lyme area. Buddy the Lab gets covered with ticks 10 months out of the year, and spends 90 percent of his time running with deer and mice. I think a sincere discussion about the pros and cons of Lyme vaccination is appropriate.\nWhat about the feline leukemia vaccine? I have many cat owners who want to do the best for their cat. The scenario: Mrs. A-Plus\u00c2\u00a0has\u00c2\u00a0Fifi, who sleeps in the bed and never goes out, and Dodo, who spends 75 percent of his time \u00e2\u20ac\u0153catting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd around and comes home for meals.\nFifi thinks Dodo is an idiot and never gives him the time of day. Mrs. A+ wants to vaccinate Fifi for leukemia because of the intensely low possibility that she might contract feline leukemia from Dodo. This is a case where there is no right or wrong answer. But I should have a clear and honest discussion with Mrs. A+ about the danger\/safety of the leukemia vaccine, the risks involved, her peace of mind and the necessity for that cat to be vaccinated. Mrs. A+ can then make her own educated decision.\nAnother example is the rabies vaccination for cats. The older vaccine has a small risk of causing a tumor at the site of the injection. It is labeled for a 3-year duration in many states. The newer vaccine has no chance of causing the vaccine-associated tumor but it is labeled only for one year.\nSome clients\u00c2\u00a0seem outraged that I even offer the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less safe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vaccine, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a no-brainer for them. They want absolutely no risk of a tumor, no matter how low the possibility. Others scoff at the idea of the low tumor risk, take their chances and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be bothered thinking about annual vaccination.

J. Dunn, Jr. DVM\nWell, you've really gone and done it now, haven't you? You went out and found yourself a puppy. And if this is your very first pup, there may be just a bit of \"What have I done?\" anxiety about this major moment in your life. This is natural as owning and caring for a puppy is a huge responsibility. Here are some good health care tips that will hopefully help your little rascal live in to its late teens.\nOne common multivalent vaccine used for dogs is DHLPPCv. Instead of giving six different injections, all these \"vaccines\" or antigens can be given in a single small volume injection.\u00c2\u00a0Certainly administering the DHLPPCv is easier on your puppy than getting six separate injections.\nD... Canine Distemper Virus - This contagious and serious viral illness has no known cure, which makes it even more vital for your puppy to have a vaccine that combats it.\nH... Hepatitis - This viral infection is actually caused by two related viruses; it mainly affects the liver.\nL... Leptospirosis - This bacterial infection affects a puppy's kidneys. It can also infect humans, cows, dogs, pigs and other mammals.\nP... Parainfluenza - This virus can cause upper respiratory infections in puppies.\nP... Parvovirus - A severe and often fatal virus that affects the lining of the intestinal tract.\nCv... Coronavirus - Similar to the Parvovirus, it can be very severe; however, it has a somewhat different effect on the intestinal tract and is generally not considered fatal.\nCall your veterinarian before you pick up your puppy and have him or her examined as soon as possible. In fact, it's best if you bring in the pup to the vet before you even go home for the first time; and don't forget to bring in a stool sample for analysis (your puppy may have worms).\nDuring the examination the veterinarian will look at the pup's medical\/vaccination history. If the breeder or shelter gave your puppy vaccinations recently, and your veterinarian is confident that it was done properly, a schedule for follow-up vaccinations will be made.\nEvery veterinarian will have a preferred protocol for vaccinating puppies and for follow-up vaccinations. In addition, protocols change because of new research findings for the duration of the vaccine's immunity. Here is a general vaccine protocol for a puppy. Consult a veterinarian to learn what's best for your puppy.\n6 to 7 weeks of age: Administer first combination vaccine (Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza, Coronavirus).\n9 weeks of age: Administer second combination vaccine.\n12 weeks of age: Administer the third combination injection and possibly a lyme vaccine inoculation. Generally a lyme vaccine is repeated two weeks later, then once a year.\n16 weeks of age: Adminster the last combination vaccine.\n12 to 16 weeks of age: Adminster rabies vaccine. The timing of this vaccine may depend on the laws in your area (since this can be a human disease, too). Confirm with your veterinarian and check your local and state laws.\nSpecial considerations: Many veterinarians believe some breeds, such as Rottweilers and Dobermans, should have at least two Parvo vaccines with the last one being given at 20 weeks of age.\n","188":"Epidemiology\nPreparations Available for Use in Canada\nEfficacy, Effectiveness and Immunogenicity\nRecommendations for Use\nVaccine Administration\nSerologic Testing\nStorage Requirements\nSimultaneous Administration with Other Vaccines\nOther Considerations\nSelected References\nRabies is a rare viral central nervous system infection most often transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mammal.\nTransmission of rabies from salivary contamination of scratches, broken skin or the mucous membranes without a bite is rare.\nPre-exposure immunization for high risk persons produces rabies neutralizing antibodies.\nPost-exposure prophylaxis is highly effective in preventing rabies.\nAdverse reactions for rabies vaccines include injection site reactions, such as pain, erythema, swelling and itching.\nPre-exposure immunization is given to people at high risk of close contact with rabid animals or the rabies virus (e.g., people with occupational exposure to animals; laboratory workers handling the rabies virus; certain travellers; hunters and trappers in areas with confirmed rabies; and spelunkers).\nEvaluation of an individual's need for post-exposure prophylaxis includes risk assessment related to the exposure to the potentially rabid animal.\nPre-exposure immunization: three 1.0 mL intramuscular (IM) or 0.1 mL intradermal (ID) doses of rabies vaccine given on days 0, 7 and any time between days 21 to 28. Rabies vaccine must never be given into the gluteal muscle due to the risk of a decreased immune response.\nPost-exposure management requires consideration of: the exposure to the potentially rabid animal; management of the potentially rabid animal; and management of the exposed person.\nIf indicated, initiate post-exposure prophylaxis as soon as possible but administer regardless of the time interval since exposure. Post-exposure prophylaxis of immunocompetent persons who have not been previously immunized with rabies vaccine consists of: local wound treatment; rabies immune globulin (20 IU\/kg body weight) given on day 0 with as much as possible infiltrated into and around the wound; and four 1.0 mL IM doses of rabies vaccine given on days 0, 3, 7 and 14. In those who have not previously been immunized, and either are immunocompromised or are taking antimalarial drugs, a fifth dose of vaccine should be given on day 28.\nPost-exposure prophylaxis of persons previously appropriately immunized with rabies vaccine consists of: local wound treatment and two 1.0 mL IM doses of rabies vaccine given on days 0 and 3. Rabies immune globulin should not be given to persons who have previously received appropriate rabies vaccinations.\nVaccination schedules for post-exposure prophylaxis should be adhered to as closely as possible; it is essential that all doses be received. Post-vaccination serology is recommended: after pre-exposure immunization using the ID route; following immunization of immunocompromised individuals or people taking chloroquine; or if there has been a significant deviation from the recommended vaccination schedule.\nHuman rabies occurs very rarely in Canada, but if not prevented, is almost always fatal once symptoms develop. Recent cases have been due to bat exposures.\nPre-exposure immunization and post-exposure prophylaxis result in antibodies that prevent the virus from entering the peripheral nervous system.\nSignificant revisions since the last chapter update are highlighted in the Canadian Immunization Guide Table of Updates available on the Public Health Agemcy of Canada website.\nFor additional information, refer to previously published National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) Statements and Statement Updates. For additional information regarding rabies vaccine and travellers, refer to previously published Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel (CATMAT) Statements and Statement Updates.\nInfectious agent \n         Rabies virus is a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of the Rhabdoviridae family. There are different antigenic variants of rabies virus distinguished by laboratory testing. Specific variants tend to occur in specific species of mammals, although these variants can be found in other mammalian species as well. The virus is easily killed by sunlight, soap and drying.\nReservoir\n         Rabies is a disease of mammals, both domestic and wild. Dogs are the main carriers of the disease in Asia and Africa. In Canada and the US, foxes, skunks, raccoons and bats may be reservoirs capable of transmitting infection to dogs, cats, livestock and people.\nTransmission\n         Rabies is spread to humans when virus in the saliva of an infected animal enters through a bite, scratch, broken skin, the mucous membranes or the respiratory tract. The virus then gains access to the central nervous system through peripheral nerves. Bites from an infected animal are the main route of exposure. Transmission also occurs through transplantation of organs from undiagnosed infected persons. The usual incubation period is proportional to the distance from the portal of entry to the brain, and may vary from several days to years (most commonly 3 to 8 weeks).\nRisk factors\n         People who work in close contact with animals, such as veterinarians and veterinary staff, animal control and wildlife workers, and laboratory workers who handle the rabies virus are at higher risk for exposure to rabies. Individuals who engage in activities such as hunting and trapping or cave exploration (spelunkers) that place them in close contact with potentially rabid animals, such as bats, foxes, skunks and raccoons, in areas where rabies is found, may also be considered at higher risk of rabies exposure.\nChildren are considered at higher risk for exposure to rabies because they may be more likely to approach animals and are less likely to report bites or scratches. Additionally, children may be more likely to be bitten on the face which carries a higher risk of infection and bites to children can be severe.\nRisk to travellers varies depending on itinerary, purpose and duration of the trip, as well as activities and access to medical care.\nSpectrum of clinical illness \n         Rabies is an almost always fatal viral infection of the central nervous system. Early symptoms of rabies may include headache, malaise, fever and fatigue. There may be discomfort or pain at the exposure site (i.e., the site where the person was bitten). Symptoms progress quickly as the central nervous system is attacked, and the illness generally presents in one of two ways. The more common, agitated (furious) form presents with the classic symptoms of hydrophobia and aerophobia (severe laryngeal or diaphragmatic spasms and a sensation of choking when attempting to drink or when air is blown in the face) with a rapidly progressing encephalitis and death. The paralytic form of the disease manifests in progressive flaccid paralysis, has a more protracted course, and is more difficult to diagnose. A more detailed description of the clinical signs of rabies in animals is available at: Fact Sheet: Rabies.\nGlobal\n         Rabies occurs worldwide, although most human deaths occur in Asia and Africa. In recent years, bat-related rabies has become the most important public health concern for rabies in the Americas and the Caribbean. A map of the areas where rabies transmission occurs is available from the World Health Organization (WHO) website: Rabies countries or areas at risk.\nNational \n         Human rabies occurs very rarely in Canada. Between 1924 and 2009, 24 people in six provinces died of rabies (Figure\u00c2\u00a01): Quebec (12), Ontario (6), Saskatchewan (2), Alberta (2), British Columbia (1) and Nova Scotia (1). The three most recent human cases in Canada were bat-related; the cases occurred in Quebec in 2000, British Columbia in 2003 and Alberta in 2007.\nRabies incidence rates are similar in Canada and the US and are reported in cases per billion person-years because of the extremely low number of cases. Between 1990 and September 2007, 36 bat-related human rabies cases were identified in Canada (3 cases) and the US (33 cases), resulting in an incidence rate of 6.7 cases per billion person-years. Of these 36 bat-related human cases, the types of exposures reported were as follows:\nHistory of household exposure to a bat: 16.7%\nNo history of exposure to a bat: 30.5%\nRabies testing of animals is carried out mainly when there has been a possible exposure involving a human or other animal, or for special studies. Therefore, the incidence and prevalence data for animal rabies are influenced by the likelihood that an animal will have these types of encounters in the different jurisdictions, and that the animal will be captured and submitted for testing. The number of rabid animals detected in Canada has decreased considerably from 670 in 2000 to 145 in 2009. Part of this decline is related to wildlife rabies control measures, such as oral rabies vaccinations delivered through baiting programs and trap-vaccinate-release programs.\nThere are regional differences in the prevalence of animal rabies and the specific species infected in each region vary over time. Therefore, it is important for health care providers to consult local public health departments regarding local epidemiology and for public health officials to remain current, based on information from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) website: Positive Rabies in Canada\nBetween 2006 and 2010, a total of 1005 cases of confirmed animal rabies were reported in Canada. Four provinces accounted for the majority of these cases: Ontario (35%), Manitoba (22%), Quebec (16%) and Saskatchewan (13%). North West Territories had 66 cases (6.5%), British Columbia 54 cases (5%), and Alberta 11 (11%). Nova Scotia reported 3 cases, New Brunswick 2 cases and Prince Edward Island 1 case. The Yukon, and Newfoundland and Labrador, had no reported cases of animal rabies.\nOver the same time period, skunks accounted for 37% of reported cases, followed by bats (33%), raccoons (9%) and foxes (6%). Dogs accounted for 4% and cats accounted for 2% of animal rabies cases. The species most commonly identified as having rabies by region, based on total numbers of positive test results, were as follows: foxes in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Territory (70%), skunks in Manitoba (75%) and Saskatchewan (70%), and bats in British Columbia (99%), Alberta (81%), Quebec (70% since 2008 when raccoon rabies was last detected) and Ontario (56%); In Ontario, the second most affected species was skunks (27%).\nRaccoon rabies arrived in Canada from the US in 1999 and was found mainly in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Quebec. A small number of rabid raccoons were also found in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. An active eradication program was put in place and, based on reports to September 2011, no rabid raccoons have been detected in Canada since 2008.\u00c2\u00a0\nRabies occurs in larger rodents such as ground hogs (woodchucks) and beavers in some areas of the US. Rabies in these animals is rare in Canada with only three rabid ground hogs (woodchucks) detected from 1998 to mid-2011, two in Manitoba in 1999 and one in Ontario in 2000.\nRabid bats have been found in most regions across Canada. The prevalence of rabies in wild bats is generally unknown, although older studies suggest a prevalence of between less than 1% and 4.1%. In 2006, the CFIA tested 2,150 bats, 3.3% of which were positive.\nBat strains of rabies virus have occasionally been identified in other animals such as foxes, cows, horses, squirrels, skunks, dogs and cats. Almost any mammal that has been exposed to an infected bat may become infected. No human cases of rabies associated with bat strains have been known to be transmitted from exposure to other animals.\nIMOVAX\u00c4\u00a3 Rabies (inactivated, human diploid cell rabies vaccine).

Failures of post-exposure management have occurred, although almost always after deviation from the recommended post-exposure prophylaxis protocol. No post-exposure prophylaxis failures have occurred in Canada or the US.\nPre-exposure immunogenicity\n         The immunogenicity of PCECV and HDCV for pre-exposure vaccination has been demonstrated in clinical trials. When PCECV was administered according to the recommended immunization schedule, 100% of subjects attained an adequate antibody titre by Day 28 or earlier. Persistence of adequate antibody titres for up to 2 years after immunization with PCECV has been demonstrated. After a three-dose primary series of HDCV, all vaccinees reached an adequate antibody titre. A 10-year follow-up study of subjects who received three doses of HDCV, followed by a booster dose at 1 year, has shown the maintenance of protective antibody up to 5 years in 96.2%. A seroconversion rate of 95.1% was demonstrated in travellers who received three ID injections of HDCV or PCECV, with a booster after 12 months.\nPost-exposure immunogenicity\n         Clinical studies in patients exposed to rabies virus have demonstrated that PCECV, when used in a five- or six-dose post-exposure schedule, provided protective antibody titres in 98% of patients within 14 days and in 100% of patients by Day 30. In a study of subjects who received HDCV in a five-dose post-exposure schedule as well as RabIg on day 0, all vaccinees reached a protective antibody titre by day 14 and remained at that level through day 90. One year later, protective antibody concentrations were maintained in 98.3% of subjects.\nPre-exposure rabies immunization with either HDCV or PCECV should be offered to people at high risk of close contact with rabid animals or the rabies virus, for example:\nLaboratory workers who handle the rabies virus.\nVeterinarians, veterinary staff, animal control and wildlife workers. Refer to Workers.\nCertain travellers. Refer to Travellers.\nHunter and trappers in areas with confirmed rabies.\nSpelunkers (cavers).\nRisk assessment related to the exposure to the potentially rabid animal\n         Rabies prophylaxis must be considered in every incident in which human exposure to potentially rabid animals has occurred, unless rabies is known to be absent from the local animal population. In evaluating each case, local public health officials should be consulted. When considering the need for post-exposure management, the following should be reviewed:\nThe species of animal, including the prevalence of rabies in that species and the prevalence of rabies in other species in the area.\nThe type of exposure - bite, non-bite (e.g. salivary contact with open skin or mucous membrane, transplant of infected organs), or direct contact with a bat.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a0 Unless one of these three potential modes of exposure has occurred, transmission of rabies is highly unlikely.\nThe circumstances of the exposure - provoked, unprovoked.\nThe vaccination status and behaviour of a domestic animal.\nThe age of the exposed person.\nThe location and severity of the bite (e.g., the size and number of bites).\nIn addition, the availability of the animal for observation or testing influences the management of the animal and the exposed person. Table 1 summarizes factors to be considered when assessing the risk related to the exposure to a potentially rabid animal.\nSpecies of animal\n         The animals in Canada most often proven rabid are wild terrestrial carnivores (e.g. skunks, foxes and raccoons), bats, cattle and stray dogs and cats. As the distribution of animal rabies and the species involved vary considerably across Canada, it is important to consult local public health officials in cases of possible exposure. In North America, domestic dog and cat exposures may be managed differently than in other areas of the world, where the prevalence of rabies in these animals is higher, and where programmes to control the populations of stray dogs are not in place.\nIf the incident involves a dog or cat, determining if it is a stray or domestic animal assists with the risk assessment. Generally, rabies is less likely in domestic animals, particularly domestic dogs, compared to stray animals, due to the following factors: domestic animals are more likely to be vaccinated; and domestic animals may spend less time outdoors where exposure to a potentially rabid animal could occur. In addition, an encounter with a potentially rabid animal is more likely to be recognized in a domestic animal.\nHuman exposures to livestock are usually confined to salivary contamination, with the exception of horses and swine, from which bites have been reported. The risk of infection after exposure to rabid cattle is low. Squirrels, hamsters, guinea-pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rats, mice or other small rodents, as well as lagomorphs (such as rabbits and hares), are rarely found to be infected with rabies because it is believed that they are likely to be killed by the larger animal that could have potentially transmitted rabies to them. These small animals can, theoretically, become infected by bat strains of rabies; however, no cases of transmission of bat strains of rabies from these animals to humans have been documented. Because these small animals are not known to have caused human rabies in North America, post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered only if the animal's behaviour is highly unusual. For example, a bite from a squirrel while feeding it would not be considered unusual behaviour and so does not warrant post-exposure prophylaxis, based on this information alone. Rabies in larger rodents such as groundhogs (woodchucks) and beavers is rare in Canada; exposure to these animals requires an assessment of the circumstances of the exposure to determine the need for post-exposure prophylaxis.\nThe manifestations of rabies and the incubation periods vary in different species. The length of time virus may be excreted in saliva before the development of symptoms (asymptomatic carriage) has not been determined for the purpose of defining rabies exposure except in dogs, cats and ferrets. In dogs, cats and ferrets, rabies virus excretion does not generally precede symptom development beyond 10 days.\n Type of exposure\n         Rabies is transmitted only when the virus is introduced into a bite wound, open cuts in skin, or onto mucous membranes such as the mouth or eyes. Transmission of rabies occurs most commonly through bites. Corneal transplants are the most common non-bite exposures leading to human rabies. In 2004, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first reported case of rabies following solid organ transplantation. Between 1956 and 1977, four cases of human rabies may have been acquired through aerosolized virus across mucous membranes. Two of these cases of rabies have been attributed to probable aerosol exposures in laboratories, and two cases have been attributed to possible airborne exposures in caves containing millions of bats; however, alternative infection routes cannot be discounted in several of these cases. Similar airborne incidents have not occurred in approximately 25 years, possibly because of elevated awareness of such risks resulting in increased use of appropriate preventive measures.\nThe contamination of open wounds, abrasions, scratches or mucous membranes with saliva or neural tissues are also considered forms of non-bite exposures. Only eight instances of human rabies from cutaneous or mucous membrane exposures were found in a review published in 2002 and these were not well documented, raising the possibility of other routes of exposure. The reports of scratches consist of a facial scratch from a bat in 1985 and a scratch from a rabid calf in the 1940s.\nTypes of exposures can be considered in three broad categories: bite exposures, non-bite exposures and bat exposures as follows:\nBite exposure: A bite is defined as any penetration of the skin by teeth. Bites inflicted by most animals are readily apparent with the exception of bats. Bites inflicted by bats may not be felt and may leave no visible bite marks (refer to Bat Exposure).\nNon-bite exposure: Non-bite exposures, other than organ or tissue transplants, have almost never been proven to cause rabies, and post-exposure prophylaxis is not indicated unless the non-bite exposure involves saliva or neural tissue being introduced into fresh, open cuts or scratches in skin or onto mucous membranes. These exposures require a risk assessment that consider the likelihood of saliva contamination (e.g., did the animal lick the wound?), the prevalence of rabies in the area, the species involved (domestic or stray dog or cat, wild terrestrial animal, or bat) and the circumstances of the exposure (e.g., provoked or unprovoked; the behaviour of a domestic animal). Petting a rabid animal or handling its blood, urine or feces is not considered to be an exposure; however, such contact should be avoided. Being sprayed by a skunk is also not considered an exposure. These incidents do not warrant post-exposure prophylaxis.\n           Post-exposure prophylaxis or testing of a bat is generally recommended after direct contact with the bat (refer to Bat Exposure) because it is very difficult to ensure that a bite did not take place.\n           Post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended in rare instances, such as inhalation of aerosolized virus by spelunkers exploring caves inhabited by infected bats or by laboratory technicians homogenizing tissues infected with rabies virus without appropriate precautions; however, the efficacy of prophylaxis after such exposures is unknown.\n           Exposures occurring in the course of caring for humans with rabies could, theoretically, transmit the infection. No case of rabies acquired in this way has been documented, but post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered for individuals exposed to saliva or neural tissue from a person with rabies.\n           Direct contact with a bat is defined as a bat touching or landing on a person. When there is no direct contact with a bat, the risk of rabies is extremely rare and rabies post-exposure prophylaxis is not recommended. In an adult, a bat landing on clothing would be considered reason for intervention only if a bite, scratch or saliva exposure into a wound or mucous membrane cannot be ruled out. In a child, a bat landing on clothing could be considered a reason for intervention, as a history to rule out a bite, scratch or mucous membrane exposure may not be reliable. When a bat is found in the room with a child or an adult who is unable to give a reliable history, assessment of direct contact may be difficult. Factors indicating that direct contact may have occurred include the individual waking up crying or upset while the bat was in the room or observation of an obvious bite or scratch mark.\n           From 1998 to 2009, NACI recommended that people who may not be aware of or able to report a bat bite (e.g., sleeping person, young child, cognitively impaired) be offered intervention if a bat was found in the room with them. This recommendation was revised (as described above) in 2009 based on the rarity of human rabies related to bats (one case in Canada reported approximately every 5 years). Analysis conducted in Canada estimated that a case of human rabies related to bedroom exposure to a bat (i.e., finding a bat in the room of a sleeping person with no recognized physical contact with the bat) is expected to occur in Canada once every 84 years. In addition, it has been determined that, to prevent one case of rabies from bedroom exposure to a bat, using a conservative estimate, 314,000 people would need to be treated.\nCircumstance of the exposure\n         An unprovoked attack is more likely to indicate that the animal is rabid, although, rabid animals may become uncharacteristically quiet. Bites inflicted on a person attempting to feed or handle an apparently healthy animal should generally be regarded as provoked. Untrained individuals should never handle wild or stray animals or any domestic animal that is behaving unusually and children should be taught this precaution.\nVaccination status and behaviour of the animal\n         Domestic pets with up-to-date rabies vaccination are unlikely to become infected with rabies. A veterinarian should be consulted to determine if the animal is up-to-date with its vaccinations. Any domestic dog, cat or ferret (regardless of vaccination history) that has bitten a human should be reported to public health officials for appropriate follow-up.\nA history of abnormal or aggressive behaviour in a domestic animal, potential for exposure of a domestic animal to other animals that could transmit rabies to the domestic animal, and a previous encounter of a domestic animal with a wild animal should be considered as factors that increase the likelihood that a domestic animal exposure carries a risk of rabies transmission. Generally, behaviour in wild animals cannot be accurately evaluated and should not be considered part of the risk assessment; however, some behaviours in bats may be considered abnormal and indicative of rabies, such as a bat attacking a person or hanging on tenaciously to a person.\nThe age of the exposed person\n         The history obtained from a child who has been potentially exposed to an animal can be difficult to interpret and potentially unreliable. This factor should be considered when determining the appropriate post-exposure management.\nThe location and severity of the bite\n         When the rabies virus is inoculated into a wound, it must be taken up at a nerve synapse to travel to the brain, where it causes fatal encephalitis. The virus may enter a nerve rapidly or it may remain at the site of the bite for an extended period before gaining access to the nervous system. Post-exposure prophylaxis is ineffective after the rabies virus invades the nervous system.\nMore severe bites may be more likely to suggest the animal is rabid and these bites may also provide more opportunity for transmission of the virus, because of the increased extent of exposure to saliva.\u00c2\u00a0\nA higher density of nerve endings in the region of the bite increases the risk of developing rabies encephalitis. Bites on the hands and face, because of the density of nerve endings, are considered higher-risk exposures.\nTable 1 provides an outline of factors to consider in the risk assessment related to exposure to potentially rabid animals.\n Table 1:  Risk Assessment Related to the Exposure to the Potentially Rabid Animal\n         This table and accompanying text are guides for management and do not replace clinical judgment.\nIn North America, rabies occurs mainly in bats, foxes, skunks, raccoons and stray dogs and cats.\nIs the animal a domestic pet, wild animal or stray animal?           \n In the event of exposure to a fox, skunk, raccoon or bat in areas where rabies is known to occur in these animals, post-exposure prophylaxis should begin immediately unless the animal is available for rabies testing and rabies is not considered likely. Post-exposure prophylaxis should not be delayed beyond 48 hours while waiting for test results in wild animals.\nIs the dog, cat or ferret available for observation?           \nIf the dog, cat or ferret is healthy after a 10-day observation period, the animal would not have been shedding rabies virus in their saliva and would not have been infectious at the time of the exposure.\nIf the dog, cat or ferret is available, is it clinically healthy?           \nIf the dog, cat or ferret has or develops signs of rabies, post-exposure prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible.\nAbnormal behaviour in a domestic pet may indicate that the animal is rabid. Generally, it is not possible to assess animal behaviour in wild animals.\nIf the animal is a domestic pet, what is the vaccination status of the animal?           \nIf the animal is a domestic pet, has it been exposed to wild or outdoor animals?           \nWhat was the type of exposure: bite, non-bite (e.g.salivary contact on open skin or mucous membrane), or bat?           \nTransmission rarely occurs from non-bite exposures. Petting a rabid animal or handling its blood, urine or feces are not considered exposures.\nCan a bite or saliva exposure into a scratch, wound or mucous membrane be ruled out?           \nRabies transmission occurs most commonly through a bite. Aerosol transmission is rare as is transmission when scratches, wounds, or mucous membrane are contaminated from saliva or infected neural tissue.\nWhat were the circumstances of the exposure (e.g., provoked or unprovoked attack)?           \nWhat is the age of the exposed person? Is the exposed person able to provide a reliable history?           \n The history obtained from a child may be difficult to interpret and, potentially, unreliable. Assessment of the exposure may also be difficult in a cognitively impaired adult.\nManagement of the potentially rabid animal\n         Any animal that has bitten a human or is suspected of being rabid should be reported to local public health officials.\nRabies testing of animals is done at the CFIA Rabies Laboratories at Ontario Laboratory Fallowfield (OLF - Rabies unit), and the CFIA Lethbridge Laboratory (LET-Rabies unit) using a fluorescent antibody test of brain tissue, which is the gold standard recommended by the WHO. The test has a reported sensitivity of 98% to 100%. Further information and testing advice may be obtained from the CFIA web site .\nDogs, cats and ferrets\n         Exposures to dogs, cats and ferrets that could potentially result in rabies transmission (as described in Type of exposure) should be reported to local public health officials. Dogs, cats and ferrets that are apparently healthy should be confined and observed for 10 days after a bite, regardless of the animal's rabies vaccination status. If these animals - are alive and healthy at the end of the 10-day period, they would not have transmitted rabies in their saliva at the time of the bite. If illness suggestive of rabies exists at the time of the bite or develops during the observation period, the animal should be humanely euthanized in a way that does as little damage to the brain as possible, and the head submitted for laboratory examination and rabies testing. Rabies virus is readily demonstrable in brains of animals with neurologic symptoms. The CFIA veterinarian should be contacted to assist with determining the need for testing, organizing the testing and following-up potential exposures to other domestic animals.\nThe confinement and observation of an apparently healthy dog, cat or ferret can take place at the owner's home, an animal shelter, or a veterinarian's office, depending on circumstances, including the reliability of the owner, the capacity to keep the animal away from people and other animals, the ability to prevent the animal's escape, and the suspicion of rabies in the animal. The person responsible for observation of the animal should be advised to notify public health officials if the animal becomes ill or escapes during the observation period. The animal should be observed by a public health official or veterinarian at the end of the 10-day observation period to ensure that it is alive and healthy. Unvaccinated animals that remain healthy should be vaccinated at the end of the observation period.\nStray or unwanted dogs, cats or ferrets involved in an exposure that could potentially transmit rabies should be confined and observed as outlined above. If this is not possible, the animal should be humanely euthanized in a way that does as little damage to the brain as possible, and the head submitted for laboratory examination and rabies testing in consultation with the local CFIA veterinarian.\nIf the dog, cat or ferret has escaped, attempts should be made to find the animal and owner. If the dog, cat or ferret cannot be located, a decision should be made in consultation with public health officials regarding the need for post-exposure prophylaxis. Refer to Management of the person after exposure to a potentially rabid animal for additional information.\nWild terrestrial carnivores and exotic pets (other than ferrets)\n         The period of rabies virus shedding in a wild terrestrial carnivore (such as a skunk, fox or raccoon) or in an exotic pet (other than a ferret) is unknown. Therefore, when these animals are involved in an exposure that could potentially transmit rabies, a trained wildlife or animal control worker should be contacted to capture the animal. The worker should use extreme caution to ensure that there is no further exposure to the animal. The animal should be immediately humanely euthanized in a way that does as little damage to the brain as possible, and the head submitted for laboratory examination and rabies testing in consultation with the local CFIA veterinarian.\nBats\n         If there has been no direct contact with the bat, the bat should not be captured for testing and should be safely released. To remove a bat from a building, the area with the bat should be closed off from the rest of the building and people and pets kept out of the area. The doors or windows in the area with the bat should be opened to the exterior to let the bat escape.\nIf there has been direct contact with a bat (as defined in Bat exposure), a trained wildlife or animal control worker should be contacted to attempt to capture the bat. The worker should use extreme caution to ensure that there is no further exposure to the bat. She or he should wear thick leather gloves, should avoid touching the bat, and should place the intact bat in a closed secure container. Once the bat has been captured, local public health officials should be contacted. The public health agency will contact the CFIA regarding rabies testing of the bat. Bats should be submitted intact for rabies testing, i.e. they should not be decapitated.\n Management of the person after exposure to a potentially rabid animal\n         Table 2 outlines recommendations for the management of people after possible exposure to rabies. These recommendations are intended as a guide and may need to be modified in accordance with the specific circumstances of the exposure.\nThe objective of post-exposure management is to neutralize the rabies virus at the site of infection before the virus can enter the central nervous system. Immediate and thorough cleaning and flushing of the wound with soap and water is imperative and is probably the most effective procedure in the prevention of rabies. Care should be taken to clean the wound to its full depth. Flushing for approximately 15 minutes is suggested. Some guidelines also suggest the application of a viricidal agent, such as iodine-containing or alcohol solutions. Suturing the wound should be avoided if possible, and tetanus prophylaxis and antibiotics should be given as appropriate.\nIf exposure to rabies is considered highly likely, post-exposure prophylaxis should be started as soon as possible after the exposure. If the initiation of post-exposure prophylaxis is delayed until test results from the involved animal are available, a maximum waiting period of 48 hours is recommended. In consultation with public health officials, post-exposure prophylaxis may be discontinued if the animal tests negative for rabies.\nIf indicated, based on the risk assessment, post-exposure prophylaxis should be offered to exposed individuals regardless of the time interval after exposure.\nExposures to dogs, cats and ferrets\n         If the suspect animal is a dog, cat or ferret that is healthy and available for observation, post-exposure prophylaxis may be withheld, pending the animal's status after a 10-day observation period. However, if the animal has or develops signs suggestive of rabies, post-exposure prophylaxis of exposed persons should be initiated immediately. The animal should be humanely euthanized in a way that does as little damage to the brain as possible, and the head submitted for immediate laboratory examination and rabies testing. In consultation with public health officials, post-exposure prophylaxis may be discontinued if the animal tests negative for rabies.\nIf the dog, cat or ferret has escaped and cannot be located, a decision should be made in consultation with public health officials regarding the need for post-exposure prophylaxis. The decision should consider several factors, including the rate of occurrence of rabies in the area, if it was a domestic or stray animal, the type of exposure, the circumstances of the exposure, including whether it was a provoked or unprovoked exposure, and the severity and location of the wound.\nExposures to wild animals and exotic pets (other than ferrets)\n         Post-exposure prophylaxis should begin immediately following exposure to a wild terrestrial carnivore (such as a fox, skunk or raccoon) in enzootic areas, unless the animal is available for rabies testing and rabies is not considered likely. The decision to start post-exposure prophylaxis while awaiting the laboratory test results should consider several factors, including when the test results will be available, the species of animal, the rate of occurrence of rabies in that species and in other species in the area, the type of exposure, the circumstances of the exposure including whether it was a provoked or unprovoked exposure, and the severity and locations of the wounds. Initiation of post-exposure prophylaxis should not be delayed beyond 48 hours while waiting for laboratory tests, if the exposure is from a terrestrial animal in an enzootic area. If post-exposure prophylaxis is started before the test results are available, in consultation with public health officials, the rabies vaccine may be discontinued if the animal tests negative for rabies.\nExposure to small rodents (such as squirrels, chipmunks, rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils) and lagomorphs (such as rabbits and hares) has rarely been known to transmit rabies; therefore, post-exposure prophylaxis is rarely indicated after exposure to these animals. Post-exposure prophylaxis should only be considered if the animal was behaving very unusually.\nLarger rodents such as ground hogs (woodchucks) and beavers can potentially carry rabies, although it is rare in Canada. The management of exposures to these animals requires a risk assessment, which includes the frequency of rabies in these animals in the geographic area, the frequency of rabies in other animals, the type of exposure, and the circumstances of the bite including whether it was provoked or unprovoked.\nExposures to bats\n         When there is a known bat bite, scratch or saliva exposure into a wound or mucous membrane, rabies post-exposure prophylaxis should be initiated immediately because of the higher prevalence of rabies in bats. It is particularly important to do so when the exposure involves the face, neck or hands, or when the behaviour of the bat is clearly abnormal, such as a bat that attacks a person or hangs on tenaciously. If the bat is available for testing, post-exposure prophylaxis may be discontinued after consultation with public health officials if the bat tests negative for rabies.\nIf a person is touched by a bat (such as a bat in flight) and the bat is available for rabies testing, the health care provider may decide to delay post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis should not be delayed more than 48 hours. If a bat tests positive for rabies, the need for post-exposure prophylaxis should depend on whether direct contact with the bat occurred and not the rabies status of the bat. If a person is touched by a bat, but the bat is not available for testing it should be considered a direct contact and post-exposure prophylaxis should be given. \nPregnancy and breastfeeding are not contraindications to post-exposure rabies prophylaxis, but it is prudent to delay pre-exposure immunization of pregnant women unless there is a substantial risk of exposure. Refer to Immunization in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding in Part 3 for additional general information.\nCorticosteroids, other immunosuppressive agents, and immunosuppressive illnesses (e.g., congenital immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy) may interfere with the antibody response to rabies vaccine. Because of suboptimal response, in general, immunocompromised persons should be counselled to avoid situations of rabies exposure. If possible, pre-exposure immunization should be delayed in immunocompromised individuals until the immunocompromised state has resolved. In situations in which immunosuppression is planned (such as before organ transplant) and pre-exposure rabies vaccine is necessary, the vaccine series should be given only by the intramuscular route and should be completed at least 14 days prior to starting immunosuppression if possible. For hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, pre-exposure rabies vaccination can be started 6 to12 months after transplant. Depending on the risk of exposure, it may be appropriate to consider temporarily discontinuing immunosuppressive medications, in consultation with the attending physician, or to vaccinate once the person is no longer considered immunocompromised. If pre-exposure vaccination of an immunocompromised person is considered necessary because animal exposure cannot be avoided and the immunocompromising condition cannot be corrected, the vaccination should be given only by the intramuscular route and serology should be checked 7 to 14 days post-vaccination to ensure that an acceptable antibody response has developed.\nWhen post-exposure prophylaxis is administered to an immunocompromised person, a full five-dose series (days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days) should be used along with one dose of RabIg on day 0; serology should be checked 7 to 14 days after completion of the series to ensure that an acceptable antibody response has developed. If no acceptable antibody response is detected, the patient should be managed in consultation with their physician and appropriate public health officials to receive a second rabies vaccine series. RabIg should not be repeated at the initiation of this second course. Immunosuppressive agents should not be administered during post-exposure prophylaxis unless essential for the treatment of other conditions.\nRefer to Immunization of Immunocompromised Persons in Part 3 for additional general information.\nRisk to travellers varies depending on itinerary, purpose and duration of the trip, as well as activities and access to medical care. Travellers to rabies endemic areas where there is poor access to adequate and safe post-exposure management, as well as frequent and long-term travellers to high risk areas, should seriously consider receiving pre-travel rabies immunization. Children, especially those who are too young to understand the need both to avoid animals and to report a traumatic contact, are considered at greater risk of rabid animal exposure and should receive pre-exposure immunization when travelling to endemic areas. The WHO website includes a map of global areas where rabies transmission occurs: Rabies, countries or areas at risk.\nPublic health officials should be consulted regarding travellers who have had an exposure to a potentially rabid animal in a developing country, even if the traveller received a complete course of post-exposure prophylaxis in that country. The prevalence of rabies in developing countries is generally higher than in Canada, and there may be concerns about the potency of available vaccines in these countries. Options for consideration in the management of travellers exposed in developing countries include initiating or repeating all or part of the post-exposure management obtaining post-vaccination serology or both. The Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel (CATMAT) provides additional information on assessing a traveller's need for pre-travel vaccination or post-travel post-exposure prophylaxis, and identifies the rabies vaccines that meet the WHO's safety, potency and efficacy requirements.\nRefer to Immunization of Travellers in Part 3 for additional general information.\nPre-exposure rabies immunization should be offered to workers at high risk of occupational exposure to potentially rabid animals or to the rabies virus. High risk individuals may include veterinarians, veterinary staff, animal control and wildlife workers, and laboratory workers exposed to the rabies virus. Refer to Immunization of Workers in Part 3 for additional general information.\nDose\n         The IM dose is 1.0 mL; the ID dose is 0.1ml. Each 1.0 mL dose of HDCV or PCECV contains at least 2.5 international units (IU) of rabies antigen, which is the WHO recommended standard.\nPre-exposure immunization: route and schedule\n         Three doses of HDCV or PCECV are required and should be given on days 0, 7 and any time between days 21 to 28. The vaccine can be given as a 1.0 mL IM dose or a 0.1 mL ID dose.\u00c2\u00a0 Rabies vaccine should never be administered in the gluteal muscle due to variable immune response.\nWhile IM administration of pre-exposure rabies vaccine is the gold standard, the WHO considers the ID regimen an acceptable alternative, as it uses less vaccine to produce a comparable degree of protection against rabies. The ID route should not be used in persons who are immunocompromised due to illness or medication, or are taking chloroquine, as the immune response to the vaccine may not be protective under these circumstances. In these individuals, vaccine should be administered by the IM route only. This precaution is not known to apply to other antimalarial drugs. If a decision is made to give pre-exposure prophylaxis by the ID route to a person requiring chloroquine, chloroquine use must be delayed for at least one month after vaccination or given only if the person has been found to have an adequate titre post-vaccination. If the intradermal route is used, rabies vaccine should be administered only by fully trained staff in settings in which there is a well-established cold chain. The use of the proper syringe and needle is essential to ensure that the correct route and dose are used. Improper technique may result in a suboptimal dose of vaccine being administered or inadvertent subcutaneous injection of the vaccine. Vaccine wastage should be minimized by immunizing enough individuals at the same time to use all of the contents of a vial of vaccine, whenever possible.\nWhen rabies vaccine is administered ID, post-immunization antibody titres should be determined at least 2 weeks after completion of the vaccine series to ensure that an acceptable level of protection has been achieved. If using the ID route for a booster dose, serology should be checked at least 2 weeks after the booster dose.\nPost-exposure prophylaxis of previously unimmunized individuals \n         Post-exposure prophylaxis of previously unimmunized individuals should consist of both RabIg and rabies vaccine. The RabIg provides immediate passive protection until the exposed person mounts an immune response to the rabies vaccine.\nRabies Immune Globulin (RabIg)\n         The recommended dose of RabIg is 20 IU\/kg body weight for all age groups, including children, given on the first day of initiation of therapy (day 0). Because of possible interference of RabIg with the immune response to the rabies vaccine, the dose of RabIg should not be exceeded. If possible, the full dose of RabIg should be thoroughly infiltrated into the wound and surrounding area. Any remaining volume of RabIg should be injected intramuscularly, using a separate needle, at a site distant from the site of vaccine administration. When more than one wound exists, each wound should be locally infiltrated with a portion of the RabIg using a separate needle. In such instances, the RabIg can be diluted twofold to threefold in a solution of 0.9% sodium chloride to provide RabIg in sufficient volume for thorough infiltration of all wounds. If the site of the wound is unknown, the entire dose should be administered intramuscularly at a separate site from the administration of rabies vaccine. Rabies vaccine and RabIg should never be mixed in the same syringe. If RabIg is not administered as recommended at the initiation of the rabies vaccine series, it should be administered up to and including day 7 after vaccine is initiated but should not be administered after that time.\nRabies vaccine \n       For post-exposure prophylaxis of immunocompetent persons previously  unimmunized with rabies vaccine, four 1.0\u00c2\u00a0mL doses of HDCV or PCECV should be  administered IM. This is in addition to the RabIg as discussed above. The first  dose (day\u00c2\u00a00) of the four-dose course of rabies vaccine should be administered as soon as possible after  exposure based on the considerations discussed in the Management of the person after exposure to a potentially rabid animal section.  Additional doses should be administered on days\u00c2\u00a03, 7 and\u00c2\u00a014 after the first vaccination.\nPreviously unimmunized immunocompromised persons,  including those taking corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents, and  those who have immunosuppressive illnesses, and those taking chloroquine and  other antimalarials, should receive a five-dose  vaccination regimen on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 with one dose of RabIg on day\u00c2\u00a00.\nVaccine should be administered IM into the deltoid muscle in older children and adults or into the vastus lateralis muscle (anterolateral thigh) in infants, but never in the gluteal region as this may result in decreased response to the vaccine. The rabies vaccine and RabIg should be given at different anatomical sites on day 0, using a separate needle and syringe. For subsequent vaccine doses, the limb where the RabIg was administered can be used.\nThe vaccination schedule for post-exposure prophylaxis should be adhered to as closely as possible and it is essential that all recommended doses of vaccine be administered. Although there is little or no evidence, in keeping with routine immunization practice, it is recommended that, if a dose of vaccine is given at less than the recommended interval, that dose should be ignored and the dose given at the appropriate interval from the previous dose. If a dose of vaccine is delayed, it should be given as soon as possible and the schedule resumed, respecting the appropriate intervals from the latest dose. If the vaccination schedule has been altered and there is doubt about a sufficient immune response, post-vaccination serology should be obtained 7 to 14 days after completing the vaccination series.\n Post-exposure prophylaxis of previously immunized individuals\n         RabIg is not indicated and should not be given to someone who has been previously appropriately immunized as indicated below. In previously appropriately immunized individuals who require post-exposure prophylaxis, two doses of HDCV or PCECV, one administered immediately and the other 3 days later, are recommended. Appropriate previous rabies immunization consists of:\nDocumentation of a complete course of pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis with HDCV or PCECV, OR\nDocumentation of complete immunization with other types of rabies vaccine, or with HDCV or PCECV according to unapproved schedules, with the demonstration of an acceptable concentration of neutralizing rabies antibody in serum after completion of the series. Refer to Serologic Testing for information regarding criteria for serologic testing.\nA complete course of either HDCV or PCECV, as well as RabIg, is recommended for those who may have received rabies vaccines in the past but do not fulfill the criteria listed above for appropriate vaccination. A serum sample may be collected before the initiation of post-exposure prophylaxis to test for rabies antibody, and if an acceptable antibody concentration (0.5 IU\/mL or greater) is demonstrated, the vaccine course may be discontinued, provided that at least two doses of vaccine have been given. If in doubt, consultation with an infectious diseases or public health physician is recommended.\nSome individuals with ongoing high risk of exposure to rabies, such as veterinarians and veterinary staff, animal control or wildlife workers, those with ongoing bat exposures or those working with live rabies virus, may require pre-exposure booster doses if their antibody titres fall below 0.5 IU\/mL (refer to Serologic Testing for information regarding when serologic testing is recommended). People with ongoing high risk of exposure and inadequate titres should be given a booster dose of either rabies vaccine. Both HDCV and PCECV have been shown to be effective in boosting immunity in previously immunized individuals, if given either as a pre-exposure booster or for post-exposure management. A rapid anamnestic response is obtained, regardless of whether the primary vaccine was HDCV or PCECV. Refer to Post-exposure prophylaxis of previously immunized individuals for information on the post-exposure management of these individuals.\nRefer to Vaccine Administration Practices in Part 1 and Passive Immunizing Agents Part 5 for additional general information.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) is the Canadian rabies reference laboratory. NML conducts testing on serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from all provinces and territories in Canada with the exception of Ontario, where serological testing is performed by the Public Health Ontario Laboratory (PHOL).\nFollowing vaccination, neutralizing antibodies begin to develop within seven days and persist for at least two years. For testing vaccine response, NML uses a modified Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralization (FAVN) assay, while PHOL uses a modification of the Rapid Fluorescent-Focus Inhibition Test (RFFIT). Both institutions consider the antibody titre of at least 0.5 IU\/mL as an acceptable correlate of protection. Protective antibodies are present immediately after passive vaccination with RabIg and have a half-life of approximately 21 days.\nBecause of the excellent immune response to rabies vaccine, healthy people immunized with an appropriate regimen do not require routine antibody determinations after either pre-exposure or post-exposure rabies vaccination, unless one of the following applies:\nPre-exposure vaccination was given by the ID route. In this circumstance, antibody concentration should be checked at least 2 weeks after completion of the vaccine series. If using the ID route for a booster dose, serology should be checked at least 2 weeks after the booster dose.\nThe person is at ongoing high risk of exposure to rabies. Refer to People with ongoing high risk of exposure.\nThere has been substantial deviation from the recommended post-exposure schedule. In this circumstance, antibody concentration should be checked 7 to 14 days after completing the series.\nThe person has been immunized with a vaccine other than HDCV or PCECV. In this circumstance, antibody concentration should be checked at least 7 to 14 days after completing the series.\nPeople with ongoing high risk of exposure to the rabies virus or potentially rabid animals require periodic serological testing to ensure the persistence of circulating antibodies. If antibody levels fall below an acceptable concentration (less than 0.5 IU\/mL), a booster dose of HDCV or PCECV is recommended. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a0Serologic testing should occur at the following frequencies:\nContinuous risk (e.g. people who work with the rabies virus in a research or vaccine production laboratory) -serology should be checked every 6 months.\nFrequent risk (rabies diagnostic laboratory workers; spelunkers; those who frequently handle bats; veterinarians, veterinary staff, animal control and wildlife workers in areas where rabies is enzootic) - serology should be checked every 2 years.\nOthers who have less frequent risk of exposure to potentially rabid animals or whose risk is likely to be from a recognized source (such as veterinarians, veterinary staff, and animal control officers who work with terrestrial animals in areas where rabies is uncommon; veterinary students; and travellers to enzootic areas) do not require periodic serologic testing.\nIf it is possible to avoid exposure to rabies, pre-exposure immunization should be deferred in immunocompromised people until they are no longer immunocompromised. If pre-exposure immunization must be given to immunocompromised individuals, antibody response should be determined after completion of the series. Determination of antibody response is also advisable if post-exposure vaccination is given to those whose immune response may be reduced by illness or medication. In these groups, antibody titres should be determined 7 to 14 days after completing the pre-exposure or post-exposure immunization series to ensure that an acceptable antibody concentration has been achieved. If an acceptable concentration is not obtained, revaccination with a second rabies vaccine series is recommended, followed by further serologic testing. Some immunocompromised people may never mount an appropriate immune response. Refer to Immunocompromised persons.\nIf vaccine is given by the ID route, post-immunization antibody titres should be determined at least 2 weeks after completion of the vaccine series, and after booster doses, to ensure that an acceptable level of protection has been achieved.\nHDCV (IMOVAX\u00c4\u00a3 Rabies) should be store at +2\u00c2\u00b0C to +8\u00c2\u00b0C, and should not be used if it has been frozen.\nPCECV (RabAvert\u00c4\u00a3) should be store at +2\u00c2\u00b0C to +8\u00c2\u00b0C and protected from light.\nOnce reconstituted, these vaccines should be administered promptly.\nRefer to Storage and Handling of Immunizing Agents in Part 1 for additional general information. Refer to Passive Immunizing Agents in Part 5 for information regarding RabIg storage requirements.\nData are not available regarding the concurrent administration of rabies vaccines with other vaccines. Based on expert opinion, live vaccines given by nasal or oral route and essential inactivated vaccines, may be administered at the same time as rabies vaccines. Vaccines should be provided at different injection sites using separate needles and syringes.\nIf rabies immunoglobulin is administered, this may interfere with the response to live vaccines. Refer to Blood Products, Human Immune Globulin and Timing of Immunizations, and Timing of Vaccine Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u00a0 chapters in Part\u00c2\u00a01.\nRefer to Vaccine Safety in Part 2 for additional general information.\nHDCV\n         Local injection site reactions such as pain, erythema, swelling, pruritus and induration at the injection site were reported in 60% to close to 90% of recipients. Mild systemic reactions such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches and dizziness were reported in about 6% to 55% of recipients.\u00c2\u00a0\nPCECV\n         Local injection site reactions were reported in 11% to 57% of recipients, consisting of pain, tenderness, swelling, erythema and induration at the injection site lasting for 2 to 3 days. Systemic reactions are generally less common (i.e., 1% to 10% of recipients) and may consist of malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headache and fever. Lymphadenopathy, nausea and rash have been reported occasionally.\nRabIg\n         Local injection site pain, erythema and induration are commonly reported following administration of RabIg, as are systemic reactions such as headache and low-grade fever.\u00c2\u00a0 The majority of reported events were mild.\nSerious adverse events are rare following immunization and, in most cases, data are insufficient to determine a causal association.\nHDCV\n         Anaphylactic reactions have occurred in up to 1 in 10,000 vaccine recipients. Systemic allergic reactions characterized by generalized urticaria and accompanied in some cases by arthralgia, angioedema, fever, nausea and vomiting have been reported. These reactions are uncommon in people receiving primary immunization but have occurred in up to 7% of those receiving a booster dose, with onset 1 to 21 days after immunisation. Such reactions have been shown to follow the development of IgE antibodies to beta propiolactone-altered human serum albumin in the vaccine. Neurologic complications are rare, but three cases of neurologic illness resembling Guillain-Barr\u00c5\u00a5 syndrome, which resolved without sequelae within 12 weeks, were reported in the early 1980s, but a causal relationship has not been established.\nPCECV\n         Anaphylaxis following immunization with PCECV has been rarely reported. Temporally associated neurologic events have also been very rarely reported but causal association with vaccination has not been established.\nRabIg\n         Local pain, erythema and induration are common. Headache and low-grade fever may follow administration of RabIg. The majority of reported events were mild.\nVaccine providers are asked to report, through local public health officials, any serious or unexpected adverse event felt to be temporally related to vaccination. An unexpected AEFI is an event that is not listed in available product information but may be due to the immunization, or a change in the frequency of a known AEFI. Refer to Reporting adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in Canada for additional information about AEFI reporting.\nThere are no contraindications to the use of rabies vaccine or RabIg after significant exposure to a proven rabid animal; however, care should be taken if post-exposure prophylaxis is to be administered to persons who are hypersensitive to the products or to any ingredient in the formulation or component of the container (i.e. latex). Expert opinion should be sought in the management of these individuals.\nPersons with a proven history of hypersensitivity to the vaccine or any component of the vaccine or its container should not be given the vaccine for pre-exposure immunization if possible. For specific advice, consult an allergy specialist. Refer to Table 1 and Table 2 in Contents of Immunizing Agents Available for use in Canada in Part 1 for lists of all vaccines and passive immunizing agents available for use in Canada and their contents. For rabies vaccines and rabies immune globulin, potential allergens include:\nIMOVAX\u00c4\u00a3 Rabies: neomycin, phenol red\nRabAvert\u00c4\u00a3: amphotericin B, chick protein, chlortetracycline, neomycin, polygeline (gelatin)\nIMOGAM\u00c4\u00a3 Rabies: latex in vial stopper\nPersons with egg allergies are not necessarily at increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to PCECV. However, for pre-exposure vaccination, an alternative vaccine, HDCV, should be used in vaccinees with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to egg or egg products. If an alternative vaccine is not available, post-exposure prophylaxis using PCECV should be administered to a person with a hypersensitivity to egg with strict medical monitoring. Facilities for emergency treatment of anaphylactic reactions should be available. Refer to Anaphylactic Hypersensitivity to Egg and Egg Related Antigens in Part 2 for additional information.\nPersons with specific IgA deficiency have  increased potential for developing antibodies to IgA after receipt of blood  products, including rabies immune globulin, and may be at risk for anaphylactic  reactions to subsequent administration of blood products containing IgA, such  as RabIg. \nInfiltration of wounds with RabIg in some anatomical sites (finger tips) must be carried out with care to avoid increased pressure in the tissue compartment.\nA history of a serious allergic or neuroparalytic reaction occurring during the administration of rabies vaccine poses a significant dilemma in the post-exposure situation. The risk of rabies must be carefully considered before a decision is made to discontinue immunization. The use of corticosteroids to attenuate the allergic response may inhibit the immune response to the vaccine. The existing titre of rabies antibodies should be determined and expert opinion in the management of these individuals should be sought promptly.\nPregnancy is not a contraindication to post-exposure prophylaxis with rabies vaccine and RabIg, but it would be prudent to delay pre-exposure immunization of pregnant women, unless there is a substantial risk of exposure.\nPre-exposure immunization with rabies vaccine should be postponed in persons with moderate or severe acute illness. Persons with minor acute illness (with or without fever) may be vaccinated. Post-exposure vaccination should never be postponed.\nRefer to Contraindications, Precautions and Concerns in Part 2 and Passive Immunizing Agents in Part 5 for additional general information.\nRadiation therapy, chloroquine, corticosteroids, and other immunosuppressive agents may diminish the efficacy of rabies vaccine. There is no evidence that interference occurs with antimalarial drugs other than chloroquine.\nWherever possible, an immunization series should be completed with the same product. However, if it is not feasible to do so, PCECV and HDCV are considered interchangeable. People who require a booster dose of rabies vaccine can be given PCECV or HDCV, regardless of the vaccine used for the initial vaccination series. Refer to Principles of Vaccine Interchangeability in Part 1 for additional general information.\n","189":"Measles occurs worldwide and is one of the most highly communicable diseases.\nCanada has imported cases and occasional outbreaks of measles. \nMMR vaccine or human immune globulin (Ig) may be used for measles post-exposure immunization in non-immune persons.\nThe efficacy of a single dose of measles vaccine  given at 12 or 15 months of age is estimated to be 85% to 95%. With a second  dose, efficacy is almost 100%.\nReactions to MMR and MMRV vaccine are generally mild and transient and include pain and redness at the injection site, low-grade fever and rash.  \nMeasles-containing vaccine is recommended  for routine immunization of children and for immunization of children and  adolescents who missed measles immunization on the routine schedule.\nMeasles-containing vaccine is  recommended for susceptible adults born in 1970 or later.\nAdults born before 1970 can be presumed to have  acquired natural immunity to measles; however, non-immune health care workers,  travellers and military personnel should receive MMR vaccine, regardless of  year of birth.\nRoutine childhood immunization: administer  two doses of measles-containing  vaccine (MMR or MMRV); the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age and the second  dose at 18 months of age or any time thereafter, but should be given not later than around school entry.\nChildren  and adolescents who are previously unimmunized: administer two doses of measles-containing  vaccine. The minimum interval between doses of MMR vaccine is 4 weeks. MMRV  vaccine may be used in healthy children  aged 12 months to 12 years. The recommended interval between 2 doses of MMRV  vaccine is at least 3 months; a minimum interval of 6 weeks between doses may  be used if rapid, complete protection is required. \nSusceptible adults born in 1970 or later: administer one dose of MMR vaccine. Those  who are at the greatest risk of measles exposure (travellers to destinations  outside of North America, health care workers,  students in post-secondary educational settings, and military personnel) should  receive two doses of MMR vaccine. \nNon-immune  health care workers and military personnel born before 1970: administer two  doses of MMR vaccine at least 4 weeks apart.\nNon-immune  travellers born before 1970: administer one dose of MMR vaccine. \nNon-immune students born before 1970: consider administering one dose of MMR vaccine.\nMeasles occurs worldwide and is one of the most  highly communicable infectious diseases. \nComplications of measles disease occur in about  10% of measles cases. \nMMR and MMRV vaccines are safe and effective. \nSince the publication of the 2006 Canadian Immunization  Guide:\nNew recommendations have       been made for measles vaccination of health care workers, travellers and military       personnel.\nFor additional information, refer to the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) Statements: Statement on Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella  Vaccine and Updated  Recommendations for the use of Varicella and MMR Vaccines in HIV-infected  Individuals. \nInfectious agent \n Measles (rubeola, red measles) is caused by measles virus, a  member of the Paramyxoviridae family.\nReservoir\n       Humans\nTransmission\n       Measles is one of the most highly communicable infectious  diseases with greater than 90% secondary attack rates among susceptible persons.  The virus is transmitted by the  airborne route, respiratory droplets, or direct contact with nasal or throat  secretions of infected persons. The incubation period is about 10 days  (range, 7 to 18 days). The interval from exposure to appearance of rash  averages 14 days. Cases are infectious from 1 day before the beginning of  the prodromal period to 4 days after rash onset. People who recover from  measles have permanent immunity to the disease.\nRisk factors\n       All persons who have not had measles disease  or who have not been successfully vaccinated are at risk of infection. In Canada,  adults born before 1970 are generally presumed to have  acquired natural immunity to measles. Individuals at greatest risk of exposure  to measles include travellers to destinations outside of North   America, health care workers, students in post-secondary  educational settings, and military personnel.\nSeasonal\/temporal  patterns\n       Historically, measles disease occurs primarily in late  winter and spring in temperate zones. It is now restricted to sporadic cases  and outbreaks. \nSpectrum of clinical  illness\n       Symptoms of  measles include prodromal fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots  (white spots on the inner lining of the mouth) and a rash that typically begins  on the face, advances to the trunk and then to the arms and legs. Complications  such as otitis media and bronchopneumonia occur in about 10% of reported cases,  even more commonly in those who are poorly nourished and chronically ill, and  in infants less than 1 year of age. Measles encephalitis occurs in  approximately 1 of every 1,000 reported cases and may result in permanent brain  damage. Measles infection can cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE),  a rare but fatal disease. Measles during pregnancy results in a higher  risk of premature labour, spontaneous abortion and low birth weight infants.  Measles in an immunocompromised person may be severe.\nMeasles occurs worldwide and is one of the most highly  communicable infectious diseases.\u00c2\u00a0 \n        Measles has been eliminated in Canada since 1998; however, cases  continue to occur as a result of importations.\u00c2\u00a0  From 1998 to 2013, 1429 confirmed measles cases were reported in Canada,  with a median of 21.5 cases per year (range: 6 to 752). For more information  about measles, including disease distribution and epidemiology in Canada refer  to the Public Health Agency of Canada measles web page.  Comprehensive updates on the epidemiology of measles in Canada are published  annually in the Canadian  Communicable Diseases Report (CCDR).\u00c2\u00a0\nM-M-R\u00c2\u00aeII: (live, attenuated combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine), Merck Canada Inc.

Refer to Contents of Immunizing Agents Available for Use in Canada in Part 1 for lists of vaccines and passive immunizing agents available for use in Canada and their contents.\nThe  efficacy of a single dose of measles-containing vaccine given at 12 or 15 months  of age is estimated to be 85% to 95%. With a second dose, efficacy in children approaches  100%. However, measles outbreaks have occurred in populations with high immunization  coverage rates. Due to the high infectivity of measles (each case may infect 12  to 18 others) at least 95% of the population needs  to be immunized to develop herd immunity. There  are no data regarding the efficacy of MMRV vaccine.\nIn clinical studies a single injection of MMR vaccine  induced measles antibodies in 95%, mumps antibodies in 96%, and rubella  antibodies in 99% of previously seronegative children. \nIn a study of 12 month old children, a single dose of MMRV vaccine  resulted in a seroconversion rate for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella of  98%, 97%, 98% and 93%, respectively. The seroconversion rates and geometric  mean titres for individual components were not significantly different from  those achieved after MMR plus univalent varicella vaccines or MMR vaccine  alone. A study of children receiving two doses of MMRV vaccine during the  second year of life noted seropositivity for measles, mumps, rubella and  varicella of 99%, 97.4%, 100% and 99.4% respectively by the third year  post-vaccination.  Long-term persistence of anti-measles, anti-mumps, anti-rubella and  anti-varicella antibodies following MMRV vaccinations are under evaluation.\nTwo doses of measles-containing vaccine should be given for routine immunization of children and for immunization of children and adolescents who have missed measles immunization on the routine schedule. MMRV vaccine may be used in children aged 12 months to 12 years. \nRoutine immunization: adults born before 1970 are generally presumed to have acquired natural  immunity to measles; however, some of these individuals may be susceptible.\nAdults without contraindications, born  in 1970 or later who do not have documented evidence of receiving  measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday, or laboratory  evidence of immunity, or a history of laboratory confirmed measles infection  should be immunized with one dose of MMR vaccine.; \nHealth care workers, regardless of their  year of birth, who do not have documented evidence of receiving two  doses of measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday, or  laboratory evidence of immunity, or a history of laboratory confirmed measles  disease should receive two doses of MMR vaccine. Refer to Workers.\nStudents in post-secondary  educational settings, born in 1970 or  later, who do not have documented evidence of receiving two doses of measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday, or laboratory  evidence of immunity, or a history of laboratory confirmed measles disease  should receive two doses of MMR vaccine. In students born before 1970, administration of one dose of MMR vaccine should be  considered.\nMilitary personnel, regardless of their  year of birth, who do not have documented evidence of receiving two  doses of measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday, or  laboratory evidence of immunity, or a history of laboratory confirmed measles  disease should receive two doses of MMR vaccine.\nTravellers to destinations outside of North America, born in 1970 or later, who do not have documented evidence of  receiving two doses of measles-containing vaccine on or after their first  birthday, or laboratory evidence of immunity, or a history of laboratory  confirmed measles disease should receive two doses of measles-containing  vaccine. Travellers born before 1970 who do not have documented evidence of receiving a measles-containing vaccine  on or after their first birthday, or laboratory evidence of immunity, or a  history of laboratory confirmed measles disease should receive one dose of MMR  vaccine. Refer to Travellers.\nTable 1  provides a summary of criteria for measles immunity. Refer to Schedule.\nChildren  and adults lacking adequate documentation of immunization should be considered  unimmunized and started on an immunization schedule appropriate for their age  and risk factors, unless known to be immune based on laboratory testing. MMR or  MMRV vaccine, as appropriate, may be given regardless of possible previous  receipt of the vaccine because additional adverse events associated with repeated  immunization have not been demonstrated. Refer to Immunization of Children and Adults with Inadequate Immunization  Records   in Part 3 for additional general information.\nImmunity to measles, mumps and rubella should be reviewed in women of reproductive age, and vaccination should be recommended to non-pregnant susceptible women. Ideally, the immunization status of women intending to become pregnant should be reviewed and vaccines updated as necessary prior to conception. Women should delay pregnancy by at least 28 days following vaccination with a live vaccine.\nMMR and MMRV vaccines should generally not be given during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of disease transmission to the fetus; however, there is no evidence demonstrating a teratogenic or other risk from such vaccines. There was no evidence of Congenital Rubella Syndrome in any of the offspring of 226 women inadvertently vaccinated during pregnancy. Inadvertent immunization with MMR vaccine is not a reason for pregnancy termination. In some situations, potential benefits of MMR vaccination may outweigh risks such as during measles or rubella outbreaks, in which case vaccination may be considered. \nWomen who are breastfeeding can be vaccinated with MMR  vaccine. \nRefer to Contraindications, Precautions. Refer to Immunization in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding  in  Part 3 for additional general information.\nSusceptible residents of long-term care facilities should receive measles, mumps and rubella-containing vaccine as well as all routine immunizations appropriate for their age and risk factors. Refer to Immunization of Patients in Health Care Institutions  in Part 3 for additional general information.\nIn general, immunocompromised persons should not receive live vaccines because of the risk of disease caused by the vaccine strains. When considering immunization of an immunocompromised person with a live vaccine, approval from the individual\u00c3\u00ads attending physician should be obtained before vaccination. For complex cases, referral to a consultant with expertise in immunization or immunodeficiency is advised.\nPeople who have a suspicious history for immunodeficiency disorders (e.g., known or suspected family history of congenital immunodeficiency disorder or HIV infection, or history of failure to thrive and recurrent infections) should not be immunized with a live vaccine until they have been fully investigated and T cell dysfunction ruled out. Immunodeficiency states may be undiagnosed in young children presenting for routine immunizations, which include live vaccines. This is particularly important to consider in infants receiving live vaccines before 12 months of age. A history of negative prenatal screening of the infant\u00c3\u00ads mother for HIV should be obtained before administering a live vaccine. If a mother has not received routine prenatal care in Canada, the possibility of undiagnosed HIV infection should be considered.\nLive vaccines are generally not recommended for  people with congenital immunodeficiency states although some exceptions  exist.\nB cell deficiency\n MMR vaccine, as  appropriate for age, should be considered if the individual is not receiving  regular immune globulin replacement therapy which may affect the efficacy of  the vaccine. \nT cell,  natural killer T cell, and mixed cellular and antibody defects (e.g., Severe  Combined Immune Deficiency [SCID])\nAll live vaccines, including MMR and MMRV, are  contraindicated in people with defects in T cell function.\nPhagocytic  and neutrophil disorders (e.g., congenital neutropenia, leukocyte adhesion and  migration defects, chronic granulomatous disease) \nChildren with phagocytic or neutrophil disorders  may be vaccinated with MMR vaccine as appropriate for age.\nComplement deficiency\nThere are no contraindications to the use of MMR vaccine in individuals with complement deficiency disorders. Immunity can decrease over time. Measurement of antibody titres and re-immunization, if needed, should be considered.\nMalignant  hematologic disorders\nMMR and MMRV vaccines are contraindicated in individuals with severe immunodeficiency due to blood dyscrasias, lymphomas, leukemias of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic systems and in people undergoing immunosuppressive treatment for malignancy. Children with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) may be vaccinated with MMR vaccine if the disease has been in remission for at least 12 months, the child's total lymphocyte count is at least 1.2 \u00c3\u2014 109\/L, the child is not receiving radiation therapy, and maintenance chemotherapy can be withheld for at least 1 week before to 1 week after immunization.\nMalignant solid tumours\nMMR and MMRV vaccines are contraindicated in people undergoing immunosuppressive treatment for any malignant solid tumours.\nHematopoietic  stem cell transplantation (HSCT \u00e2\u20ac\u201c autologous or allogeneic)\nPre-transplantation: People awaiting HSCT should not receive measles,  mumps and rubella-containing vaccine. Vaccination of donors immediately before  stem cell harvest is not recommended as there is no evidence that immunity can  be transferred from the donor to the recipient and there are no safety data.\nPost-transplantation: Antibody titres to vaccine-preventable diseases decline after HSCT if the recipient is not re-vaccinated. Vaccination with MMR vaccine may be considered 24 months after transplantation provided there is no evidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease, immunosuppression has been discontinued for at least 3 months, and the person is considered immunocompetent by a transplant specialist. Serologic response should be checked after the first dose of MMR vaccine and a second dose should be given 3 months or more after the first dose if there is no seroconversion.\nSolid  organ transplantation\nIf possible, individuals being considered for solid organ transplantation should receive immunizations recommended for their age before the transplantation is performed. MMR vaccine may be given to infants as early as 6 months of age if transplantation is anticipated before 12 to 15 months of age. MMR vaccine should be given at least 4 weeks before solid organ transplantation and, in general, is not recommended after transplantation.  \nImmunosuppressive  therapy\nVaccination status for measles, mumps and rubella should be reviewed for immunocompetent persons who might be anticipating initiation of immunosuppressive treatments or who have diseases that might lead to immunodeficiency. Refer to Immunization of Immunocompromised Persons in Part 3 for a list of immunosuppressive medications. \nIf indicated, MMR vaccine should be administered at least 4 weeks before the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy to reduce the risk of disease caused by the vaccine strain. If MMR vaccine cannot be given prior to initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, a period of at least 3 months should elapse after immunosuppressive drugs (except high-dose systemic corticosteroids) have been stopped before administration of live vaccines to reduce the risk of disease caused by the vaccine strain. A period of at least 4 weeks should elapse between discontinuation of high-dose systemic steroids and the administration of MMR vaccine. The interval between discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs and MMR vaccine administration may vary with the intensity of the immunosuppressive therapy, underlying disease and other factors.\nIf immunosuppressive therapy cannot be stopped, live vaccines are generally contraindicated, although the risk-to-benefit ratio may favour immunization if only low doses of immunosuppressive drugs are required and there is significant risk of development of disease. The safety and efficacy of live, attenuated vaccines during low dose intermittent or maintenance therapy with immunosuppressive drugs (other than corticosteroids) are unknown. Immunosuppressive drugs have been reported to cause reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection and predisposition to other opportunistic infections. Therefore, until additional information becomes available, avoidance of MMR vaccines during intermittent or low dose chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapy is prudent. \nCorticosteroid therapy is not a contraindication to administering live vaccine when steroid therapy is short-term (i.e., less than 14 days); or a low-to-moderate dose (less than 2 mg\/kg\/day for a child or less than 20 mg\/day of prednisone or its equivalent per day for an adult); or long-term, alternate-day treatment with short-acting preparations; or maintenance physiologic replacement therapy; or administered topically, inhaled, or locally injected (e.g., joint injection). \nIn general, live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated during monoclonal antibody treatment or in infants exposed to monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies taken during pregnancy will be transferred to the fetus and their effects may persist after birth. Infants who have been exposed to monoclonal antibodies, either during pregnancy or from breastfeeding, should have B-cell enumeration. B cell enumeration should be normal before vaccination with live vaccines. Consultation with an immunologist is advised. Vaccination status should be reviewed prior to commencing monoclonal antibodies. \nHIV-infected\nAn infectious disease specialist\/immunologist  should be consulted for advice on MMR immunization in HIV-infected people. There are no contraindications to the  use of MMR vaccine early in the course of illness; however, MMR vaccine is contraindicated in persons  with advanced HIV\/AIDS.  The safety and immunogenicity of MMRV vaccine in HIV-infected individuals has  not been evaluated, and MMRV vaccine cannot be routinely recommended.\nChildren: HIV-infected children 12  months of age and older, and with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clinical category N, A, or B and  immunologic category 1 or 2 (i.e., CD4 counts \u00e2\u2030\u00a515%) may receive two doses of  MMR vaccine 3 to 6 months apart. Univalent varicella vaccine may be  administered concomitantly with MMR vaccine at different injection sites using separate needles  and syringes.\nAdolescents and adults: immunization with two doses of MMR administered 3 months apart may be considered for susceptible HIV-infected adolescents and adults with CD4 cell count \u00e2\u2030\u00a5200 x 106\/L and CD4 percentage \u00e2\u2030\u00a515%.\nSusceptible household contacts of immunocompromised  people should receive a measles-containing vaccine as appropriate for age and  risk factors.\nRefer to Contraindications and Precautions. Refer to Immunization of Immunocompromised Persons in Part 3 for additional information.\nHyposplenic  or asplenic (congenital absence, surgical removal or functional  [e.g., sickle cell disease]) individuals should be immune to measles, mumps and rubella or should receive  MMR or MMRV vaccine as appropriate.\nIndividuals with chronic renal disease or  undergoing dialysis should be immune to measles, mumps and rubella or should  receive MMR or MMRV vaccine as appropriate.\nPeople with conditions such as autism spectrum disorders or demyelinating disorders (including multiple sclerosis) should receive all routinely recommended immunizations, including MMR or MMRV vaccine as appropriate. \n Individuals with autoimmune disease not being treated with immunosuppressive drugs are not considered significantly immunocompromised and should receive MMR immunization following consultation with their physician. Rheumatic disease modifying agents such as hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or auranofin are not generally identified as immunosuppressive. \nRefer to Immunization of Persons with Chronic Diseases  in  Part 3 for additional general information.\nProtection against measles is especially important for people planning travel to destinations outside of North America. Travellers born in 1970 or later who do not have documented evidence of receiving two doses of measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday, or laboratory evidence of immunity, or a history of laboratory confirmed measles disease should receive two doses of measles-containing vaccine. \nMeasles vaccine should be given at an earlier age than usual for children travelling to countries outside of North America. MMR vaccine may be given as early as 6 months of age; however, two additional doses of measles-containing vaccine must be administered after the child is 12 months old to ensure long lasting immunity to measles. \nTravellers born before 1970, who do not have documented evidence of  receiving measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday, or laboratory evidence of immunity, or a history of laboratory confirmed measles disease should receive one dose of MMR vaccine.  \nMeasles is endemic in many countries. Refer to measles incidence rates in WHO member countries for additional information.\nRefer to Immunization of Travellers in Part 3 for additional general information. \nHealth care providers who see persons newly arrived in Canada should review the immunization status and update immunization for these individuals. In many countries outside of Canada, mumps and rubella vaccines are in limited use and measles vaccine alone is given. A Canadian study showed that more than one-third of new immigrants and refugees, particularly women, were susceptible to measles, mumps, or rubella. Refer to Immunization of Persons New to Canada in Part 3 for additional general information.\nIt is recommended  that all health care workers be immune to measles. Health care workers, regardless of  their year of birth, who do not have documented evidence of receiving two  doses of measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday, or  laboratory evidence of immunity, or a history of laboratory confirmed measles  disease should be vaccinated accordingly so that they have received two doses of  MMR vaccine.\nRefer to Immunization of Workers in Part 3 for additional general information.\nMeasles may continue to be imported into Canada. Outbreaks may occur in susceptible populations. For practical purposes, all individuals attending the same school or facility should be considered contacts.\nSusceptible, immunocompetent individuals 12 months of age and older who are exposed to measles may be protected from measles disease if they are given MMR vaccine within 72 hours of their exposure. MMR vaccine may be recommended for children between 6 months to less than 12 months of age for post-exposure management if it is given within 72 hours of exposure; however, two additional doses of measles-containing vaccine must be administered after the child is 12 months old (and at least 28 days from the previous dose) to ensure long lasting immunity to measles.  \nProphylactic use of Ig has been shown to be effective in modifying or preventing disease if administered within 6 days after exposure to measles, however, it should be given as soon as possible after exposure when indicated. Ig should be considered for contacts of measles who are: \nMeasles-containing vaccine is contraindicated in groups 1 and 2 and effectiveness and safety has not been established in group 3. Ig should also be considered for susceptible immunocompetent contacts of measles who are 6 months of age and older and who present more than 72 hours after exposure (when MMR vaccine no longer provides post-exposure protection) but within 6 days after exposure (when Ig may still provide post-exposure protection).  \nIn HIV infected individuals, measles antibody titre is known to decline more rapidly over time as compared to those who are HIV uninfected. A dose of Ig should be considered in HIV infected individuals with severe immunosuppression after a known exposure to confirmed measles, even with documented previous MMR immunization. Regardless of vaccination status pre-transplant, Ig should also be considered for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients, unless vaccinated post HSCT and known to have an adequate measles antibody titre. \nIn assessing the extent of measles exposure and deciding between MMR vaccine and Ig for post-exposure management, it is important to consider that Ig only provides short-term protection and requires postponing the administration of MMR vaccine for 5 to 6 months. If longer- term protection against measles is required because of ongoing measles transmission in the community, MMR vaccine may be the preferred choice. It is important to note that despite the use of MMR vaccine or Ig for post-exposure management, measles infection may still occur. Exposed individuals should be counseled regarding signs and symptoms of measles; counseling should  include avoiding contact with others should they become ill with symptoms compatible with measles and the need to seek medical care, including advising health care workers of the possibility of measles before going to a health care setting so that appropriate precautions can be taken. For detailed information regarding infection prevention and control, refer to the Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Measles Outbreaks in Canada. \nThe recommended dose of Ig for healthy individuals exposed to measles is 0.25 mL\/kg of body weight given by the IM route. The dose for exposed individuals who are immunocompromised is 0.5 mL\/kg of body weight. A maximum dose of 15 mL should not be exceeded. For complete prescribing information, consult the product leaflet or information contained within the product monograph available through Health Canada\u00c3\u00ads Drug Product Database. \nIndividuals receiving replacement IVIg (400 mg\/kg of body weight or higher) are considered protected and do not require Ig if the last dose of IVIg was received within the three weeks prior to measles exposure.\nUnless it is contraindicated, individuals who receive Ig should receive measles-containing vaccine after specified intervals, once the measles antibodies administered passively have degraded. For recommendations on the interval between administration of an Ig preparation or blood product and vaccination with measles-containing vaccine, refer to Blood Products, Human Immune Globulin and Timing of Immunization in Part 1.\n Refer to Passive Immunizing Agents in Part 5 for additional general information. \nImmunization with MMR vaccine is an integral element of a comprehensive measles outbreak prevention and management strategy. In a measles outbreak, MMR vaccine can be provided at any time starting from 6 months of age. However if given between 6 months and less than 12 months of age, two additional doses of measles-containing vaccine must be administered after the child is 12 months old (and at least 28 days from the previous dose) to ensure long lasting immunity to measles. For detailed information on outbreak control, refer to the Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Measles Outbreaks in Canada.\nDose\n Each  dose is 0.5 mL. \nRoute of administration\n MMR vaccine should be administered subcutaneously; MMRV can be administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Refer to Vaccine Administration Practices in Part 1 for additional information. \nChildren (12 months to 12 years of age)\n For routine immunization of children aged 12 months to 12 years, two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MMR or MMRV) should be administered. The first dose of measles-containing vaccine should be administered at 12 to 15 months of age and the second dose at 18 months of age or any time thereafter, but should be given no later than around school entry.\nThe recommended minimum  interval between doses of MMR vaccine is 4 weeks. Children who previously  received a single dose of MMR vaccine should receive a second dose at least 4  weeks after the first dose. The recommended interval between two  doses of MMRV  vaccine is at least 3 months; a minimum interval of 6 weeks between doses may  be used if rapid, complete protection is required. \nAdolescents (13 to 17 years of age)\n  Measles-susceptible adolescents should receive  two doses of MMR vaccine given  at least 4 weeks apart.\nAdults (18 years of age and  older)\n  Measles-susceptible  adults should receive one or two doses of MMR vaccine as appropriate for age  and risk factors (refer to Table 1). If two doses are needed, MMR vaccine should be administered with a minimum  interval of 4 weeks between doses. \nRe-immunization with measles-containing vaccine after age and risk appropriate vaccination is not necessary. \nSerological testing may be indicated to confirm the diagnosis of measles or to determine immune status. Serologic testing is not recommended before or after receiving measles-containing vaccine. If serology is inadvertently done subsequent to appropriate measles immunization and does not demonstrate immunity, measles re-immunization is not necessary.\nM-M-R\u00c2\u00ae II: Maintain vaccine at  +10\u00c2\u00b0C or colder during shipment. Freezing during shipment will not affect  potency of the vaccine. Protect the vaccine from light. Before reconstitution,  store the vial of vaccine at +2\u00c2\u00b0C to +8\u00c2\u00b0C or colder. The diluent may be stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature and  must not be frozen. \nPRIORIX\u00c2\u00ae: Store in a refrigerator at +2\u00c2\u00b0C to +8\u00c2\u00b0C. The  diluent may be stored separately at room temperature. Protect from light. \nPRIORIX-TETRA\u00c2\u00ae: Store the vaccine and diluent in a refrigerator at  +2\u00c2\u00b0C to +8\u00c2\u00b0C and do not freeze. Protect the vaccine from light. \nRefer to Storage and Handling of Immunizing Agents in Part 1 for additional general information. Refer to Passive Immunizing Agents Part 5 for information regarding Ig storage requirements.\n Live vaccines given by the parenteral route may be administered concomitantly with all other vaccines during the same visit using different injection sites and separate needles and syringes. In general, if two live parenteral vaccines are not administered concomitantly, there should be a period of at least 4 weeks before the second live parenteral vaccine is given. Exceptions are varicella-containing vaccines, such as MMRV vaccine:\nadminister doses of varicella-containing vaccine at least 3 months apart for children 1 to 12 years of age. If rapid, complete protection against varicella is required, a minimum interval of 6 weeks between 2 doses may be used for children 1 to 12 years of age.\ndo not concomitantly administer varicella-containing vaccines with smallpox vaccine; administer varicella-containing vaccine and smallpox vaccine at least 4 weeks apart.\nOral and intranasal vaccines can be given at the same time as, or any time before or after any other live vaccine, regardless of the route of administration of the other live vaccine.\nRefer to Timing of Vaccine Administration in Part 1 for additional general information.\nRefer to Vaccine Safety Part 2 for additional general information. \nAdverse events following MMR immunization occur less frequently and are less severe than those associated with natural disease. Adverse reactions are less frequent after the second dose of vaccine and tend to occur only in those not protected by the first dose. Six to 23 days after MMR immunization, approximately 5% of immunized children experience malaise and fever (with or without rash) lasting up to 3 days. Parotitis, rash, lymphadenopathy, and joint symptoms also occur occasionally after MMR immunization.\n Pain and redness at the injection site or low-grade fever occur in 10% or more of vaccinees. Rash, including measles-like, rubella-like and varicella-like rash, as well as swelling at the injection site and moderate fever (greater than 39\u00c2\u00b0C) occur in 1% to less than 10% of vaccinees. As varicella-like rashes that occur within the first two weeks after immunization may be caused by wild-type virus, health care providers should obtain specimens using viral transport media from a lesion to ensure varicella disease is not confused with a reaction to vaccination.\nAcute transient arthritis or arthralgia may occur 1 to 3 weeks after immunization with rubella-containing vaccine, lasts for about 1 to 3 weeks, and rarely recurs. This is more common in post-pubertal females, among whom arthralgia develops in 25% and arthritis in 10% after immunization with rubella-containing vaccine. There is no evidence of increased risk of new onset, chronic arthropathies or neurologic conditions.\nInjection site pain and tenderness,  urticaria, and angioedema may occur.\nSerious adverse events are rare following immunization and,  in most cases, data are insufficient to determine a causal association. As with  other vaccines, anaphylaxis following vaccination with MMR or MMRV vaccine may  occur but is very rare.\nImmune  Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)\n  Rarely, ITP occurs within 6 weeks after immunization with  MMR or MMRV vaccine. In most children, post-immunization thrombocytopenia  resolves within three months without serious complications. In individuals who experienced ITP with the  first dose of MMR or MMRV, serologic status may be evaluated to determine  whether an additional dose of vaccine is needed. The potential risk to benefit  ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such  cases. \nEncephalitis\n  Encephalitis has been reported in association  with administration of measles vaccine in approximately 1 per million doses  distributed in North America which is much  lower than that observed with natural measles disease (1 per 1,000 cases). \nFebrile seizures\n  Recent studies have found a higher risk of febrile seizures with the first dose of a MMRV vaccine (ProQuad\u00c2\u00ae, not authorized for use in Canada) when compared to the concomitant administration of MMR and univalent varicella vaccine. Data from the United States (US) estimated that the risk of febrile seizures in the 5 to 12 days following the first dose of this MMRV vaccine is 1 for every 2,600 vaccinated children aged 12 to 23 months. Experience with the MMRV vaccine available in Canada is more limited; however, one study showed an additional risk of febrile seizures with MMRV vaccine compared to MMR and univalent varicella vaccines given as two separate products administered concomitantly. The risk with the Canadian vaccine was smaller than the risk found with the US product. Close surveillance and further investigation are underway.\n Anaphylactic reactions, although rare, have  been reported following the injection of human immune globulin. \nIn the mid to late 1990s, researchers from the United Kingdom reported an association between MMR vaccine and inflammatory bowel disease, and MMR vaccine and autism. Rigorous scientific studies and reviews of the evidence have been done worldwide, and there is now considerable evidence to refute those claims. In 2010, the original study suggesting a link between the MMR vaccine and autism was found to be fraudulent and was retracted.\nVaccine providers  are asked to report the following AEFI in particular, through local public  health officials:\nFebrile  seizures within 30 days after vaccination with MMR or MMRV vaccine. \nVaricella  that is moderate (50 to 500 lesions) or severe (more than 500 vesicular lesions  or associated complications or hospital admission) and occurs 7 to 21 days  after vaccination with MMRV vaccine.\nAny  serious or unexpected adverse event felt to be temporally related to  vaccination. An unexpected AEFI is an event that is not listed in available  product information but may be due to the immunization, or a change in the  frequency of a known AEFI. \nRefer to Reporting Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) in Canada and Vaccine Safety in Part 2 for additional information about AEFI reporting.\nMMR and MMRV vaccines and Ig are contraindicated in persons with a history of anaphylaxis after previous administration of the product and in persons with proven immediate or anaphylactic hypersensitivity to any component of the product (with the exception of egg allergy for MMR and MMRV vaccines [refer below]), or its container. Refer to Contents of Immunizing Agents Available for Use in Canada in Part 1 for lists of vaccines and passive immunizing agents available for use in Canada and their contents. For measles-containing vaccines, potential allergens include:  \nPRIORIX\u00c2\u00ae:egg protein, neomycin \nIn situations of suspected hypersensitivity or non-anaphylactic allergy to vaccine  components, investigation is indicated which may involve immunization in  a controlled setting. Consultation with an allergist is advised.\nThe measles and mumps components of MMR and MMRV vaccines are produced in chick embryo cell culture and may contain traces of residual egg protein. The trace amount of egg protein in the vaccine appears to be insufficient to cause an allergic reaction in egg-allergic individuals. Prior egg ingestion is not a prerequisite for immunization with egg protein-containing vaccine. Skin testing is not recommended prior to vaccination as it does not predict reaction to the vaccine. MMR or MMRV vaccine can be administered in the routine manner to people who have a history of anaphylactic hypersensitivity to hens\u00c3\u00ad eggs. For all vaccines, immunization should always be performed by personnel with the capability and facilities to manage adverse events post-vaccination. Refer to Anaphylactic Hypersensitivity to Egg and Egg-Related Antigens in Part 2 for additional information.\nChildren with a  known or suspected family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency  that is a contraindication to vaccination with live vaccine should not receive  live vaccines unless their immune competence has been established.\nMMRV vaccine is contraindicated  in persons with impaired immune function, including primary or secondary  immunodeficiency disorders. Refer to Immunocompromised persons.\nMMR and MMRV  vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy. Refer to Pregnancy and breastfeeding.\nMMR vaccine is contraindicated in  individuals with active, untreated tuberculosis. While tuberculosis may be exacerbated by natural  measles infection, there is no evidence that measles-containing vaccines, such  as MMR or MMRV have such an effect. \nA history of  febrile seizures or a family history of convulsions is not a contraindication  for the use of MMRV vaccine. \nAdministration of MMR or MMRV vaccine should be  postponed in persons with severe acute illness. Persons with a  minor acute illness (with or without fever) may be vaccinated. \nIt is recommended to avoid the use of salicylates (e.g., acetylsalicylic  acid [ASA]) for 6 weeks after immunization with MMRV vaccine because of  an association between wild-type varicella, salicylate therapy and Reye's  syndrome. \nRefer to Contraindications, Precautions and Concerns in Part 2 and Passive Immunizing Agents Part 5 for additional general information. \nSystemic antiviral therapy (such  as acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) should be avoided in the  peri-immunization period, as it may reduce the efficacy of varicella-containing  vaccine such as MMRV. On the basis of expert opinion, it is recommended that  people taking long-term antiviral therapy should discontinue these drugs, if  possible, from at least 24 hours before administration of MMRV vaccine and  should not restart antiviral therapy until 14 days after.\nThe  measles component in measles-containing vaccines can temporarily suppress  tuberculin reactivity, resulting in false-negative results. If tuberculin skin testing or an  Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) test is required, it should be done on  the same day as immunization or delayed for at least 4 weeks after measles  vaccination. Vaccination with measles-containing  vaccine may take place at any time after tuberculin skin testing has been  performed and\/or read.\nPassive immunization with human Ig or receipt of most blood products can interfere with the immune response to MMR and MMRV vaccines. These vaccines should be given at least 14 days prior to administration of an Ig preparation or blood product, or delayed until the antibodies in the Ig preparation or blood product have degraded. If the interval between administration of vaccine and subsequent administration of an Ig preparation or blood product is less than 14 days, the vaccine dose should be repeated after the recommended interval. The recommended interval between administration of an Ig preparation or blood product and subsequent immunization varies, depending on the Ig preparation or blood product. If the vaccine is given too early following Ig or blood product administration, it should be repeated after the appropriate interval has passed. Palivizumab (RSVAb) and washed red blood cell transfusion do not interfere with the antibody response to MMR or MMRV vaccines. Refer to Blood Products, Human Immune Globulin and Timing of Immunization in Part 1 for additional general information. \nOn the basis of expert opinion, the MMR vaccines authorized in Canada may be used interchangeably. Refer to Principles of Vaccine Interchangeability in Part 1 for additional general information.\n","190":"Tetanus (lockjaw) occurs worldwide but is rare  in Canada because of immunisation against this infection.\nTetanus toxoid is only available in combination  vaccines.\nA primary series and boosters, including  post-exposure boosters, are recommended to develop and maintain high  circulating concentrations of tetanus antibody in the event of exposure to Clostridium tetani spores and subsequent  toxin production. In unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated individuals,  tetanus immune globulin is recommended post-exposure in certain situations.\nAfter a complete primary series (at least 3  doses), more than 99% of vaccinees develop antibody concentrations that are  protective against tetanus, but there is declining immunity over time.\nRedness, swelling and pain at the injection site are  the most common adverse reactions to tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines.\nRoutine tetanus immunization of infants and children: administer DTaP-IPV-HibKey Information - Footnote * vaccine at 2, 4, 6 and 12 to 23 months of age               (generally given at 18 months of age). If infant               immunization for hepatitis B is undertaken, DTaP-HB-IPV-HibKey Information - Footnote * vaccine may be               used. Subsequently, administer a booster dose of either DTaP-IPVKey Information - Footnote * or               Tdap-IPVKey Information - Footnote * vaccine at 4 to 6 years of age (school entry) and a booster dose of               TdapKey Information - Footnote * vaccine 10 years later at 14 to 16 years of age. \nAdults previously immunized with tetanus toxoid-containing               vaccine: administer one dose of Tdap vaccine if not previously received               in adulthood (18 years of age and older) and give a booster dose of TdKey Information - Footnote * vaccine               every 10 years. \nPost exposure\/wound management: the need for tetanus               toxoid-containing vaccine in wound management, with or without tetanus immune               globulin depends on both the nature of the wound and the vaccination history\nTetanus toxoid-containing vaccines may be administered               concomitantly with routine vaccines at different injection sites using               separate needles and syringes.\nTetanus occurs worldwide.\nMany Canadians, especially those who are older or born outside               of Canada, do not have protective concentrations of tetanus antitoxin.\nThe case fatality rate in the               unvaccinated varies from 10% to over 80% and is highest in infants and the               elderly.\nSignificant  revisions since the last chapter update are highlighted in the CIG Table of Updates, which is available on the PHAC website.\nFor additional information,  refer to previously published National Advisory Committee on Immunization  (NACI) Statements  and Statement Updates. \nInfectious agent\n         Tetanus (lockjaw) is caused by a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani.\nReservoir\n         C. tetani spores are widely         distributed in soil worldwide and have also been detected in the intestines of         animals and humans. \nTransmission\n         C. tetani spores are usually         introduced into the body through a wound that is contaminated with  soil, animal\/human feces or dust. C. tetani spores will germinate into bacilli in an anaerobic environment,         such as necrotic tissue. The bacilli release a potent neurotoxin. The incubation period is generally 3 to 21 days (range, 1 day to         several months). Since tetanus is caused by the neurotoxin, it is not         transmitted person-to-person.\nRisk factors\n         Cases of tetanus related to lacerations         (most frequent), injection drug use, and animal bites have been reported, as         well as rare cases occurring after bowel surgery or aspiration of soil and         feces. Cases may occur following small, insignificant wounds, especially when         there is necrotic tissue present. It is often associated with blunt trauma or         deep puncture wounds. Tetanus rarely occurs in fully vaccinated people and, if         it does, it is usually mild. \nSpectrum of clinical illness\n         Tetanus is characterized by muscle spasms, usually in a         descending pattern, beginning in the jaw muscles. As the disease progresses, prolonged         frequent spasms may occur, contributing to serious complications and death,         unless treatment is provided. Globally, tetanus is common in neonates who are         delivered without adequate sterile procedures. The case         fatality rate in the unvaccinated varies from 10% to over 80%, and is highest in         infants and the elderly. \nGlobal\n         Tetanus occurs worldwide but occurs most frequently in agricultural  regions and densely populated regions. A total of 9,683 cases of tetanus were reported to the World Health  Organization (WHO) in 2010. Tetanus is relatively uncommon in most developed  countries because of long-standing immunisation programmes. Although neonatal  tetanus has been eliminated in North America, it remains an important global  issue.\nNational\n         Tetanus is         rare in Canada (refer to Figure 1). Between 1990 and 2010, the number of cases reported         annually ranged from 1 to 10, with an average of 4 per year. During this period, persons         60 years of age and older accounted for 48% of the cases, of which  59% were males. No         cases were reported among neonates. The immunization status of the reported         cases was not known. Only eight deaths due to tetanus         have been reported since 1990; the last two were         reported in 2009. There is limited evidence on the protective concentrations         of tetanus antitoxin in the Canadian population. A serosurvey of adult blood         donors in Toronto found that 17.5% of donors did not have protective levels of         tetanus antitoxin. Factors associated with lack of immunity to tetanus include         increasing age, birth outside Canada, and absence of immunization records. \n Figure 1: Tetanus - number of cases and deaths, Canada, 1921-2010\nTetanus toxoid is only available in combination vaccines.\nFor  complete prescribing information, consult the product leaflet or information  contained within Health Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authorized product monographs available  through the Drug Product Database. Refer to Contents  of Immunizing Agents Available for Use in Canada in Part 1 for lists of all vaccines and passive immunizing  agents available for use in Canada and their contents.\nProtective antitoxin concentrations occur in virtually all healthy infants and children who receive primary tetanus immunization. Efficacy in standard pre-exposure and post-wound booster immunization regimens in adults has not been assessed in randomized trials but has been demonstrated in observational studies. Cases of tetanus occurring in fully immunized persons whose last dose  was within the last 10 years are extremely rare. \nIt         has been consistently demonstrated in clinical trials that one month after         completion of a three dose primary series at least 99% of vaccinees have protective antibody titre. \nTetanus         toxoid-containing vaccine is recommended for routine infant immunization,         beginning at 2 months of age. DTaP-IPV, with or without Hib vaccine, is authorized         for use in children less than 7 years of age. DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib vaccine is authorized         for use in children 6 weeks to 23 months of age and may be given to children aged         24 months to less than 7 years, if necessary. DTaP-IPV or Tdap-IPV         vaccine should be used as the booster dose for children at 4 to 6 years of age.         Children         7 years of age and older should receive the adolescent\/adult formulation of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing         vaccine, with or without polio, (Tdap or Tdap-IPV) as it contains less diphtheria         toxoid than preparations given to younger children and is less likely to cause         reactions in older children. Tdap vaccine should be administered to adolescents         at 14 to16 years of age as the first 10-year booster dose; Tdap-IPV vaccine should         be used if IPV vaccine is also indicated. \nAdults who have not previously received a primary series (at         least 3 doses) of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine should receive one dose of         Tdap-IPV vaccine followed by two doses of Td-IPV, vaccine. There is new evidence         that a booster dose of Td vaccine may not be required every 10 years. Until a full review of the literature has been completed, a booster dose of Td vaccine is recommended every 10 years. Until a full review of  the literature has been completed, a booster dose of Td vaccine is recommended  every 10 years.\nRefer to Schedule and Booster doses and re-immunization. Refer to Diphtheria         Toxoid, Pertussis Vaccine, Poliomyelitis Vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b         Vaccine and Hepatitis B Vaccine in         Part 4 for additional information.\nChildren and         adults lacking adequate documentation of immunization should be considered         unimmunized and started on an immunization schedule appropriate for their age         and risk factors. When available, serologic testing         for diphtheria and tetanus antitoxin concentrations may guide the need for         continued immunization. Refer to Immunization of Persons with Inadequate Immunization Records in Part 3 for         additional general information.\nSusceptible pregnant women may receive Td vaccine if it is indicated. There  no evidence to suggest a risk to the fetus or to the pregnancy from immunization  of the mother with Td vaccine. Neonatal tetanus may occur in infants born to  unimmunized mothers under unhygienic conditions. For the use of Tdap vaccine  during pregnancy refer to Pertussis Vaccine in Part 4. Refer to Immunization in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding \u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u00a0in Part 3 for  additional general information.\nPremature  infants in stable clinical condition should be immunized with a tetanus  toxoid-containing preparation at the same chronological age and according to the  same schedule as full-term infants. Infants born prematurely (especially those weighing  less than 1,500 grams at birth) are at higher risk of apnea and bradycardia following  vaccination. Hospitalized premature infants should have continuous  cardiac and respiratory monitoring for 48 hours after their first immunization.  Refer to Immunization of Infants Born Prematurely in Part 3 for additional general information. \nResidents of long-term care facilities should receive all         routine immunizations appropriate for their age and risk factors, including tetanus         toxoid-containing vaccine. Refer to Immunization of Persons\/Residents in Health Care Institutions in Part 3 for         additional general information.\nDiphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-polio-Hib-containing preparations may be  administered to immunocompromised persons. When  considering immunization of an immunocompromised person, consultation with the  individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attending physician may be of assistance, in addition to the  guidance provided in Immunocompromised persons  in Diphtheria Toxoid and Haemophilus  influenza type b Vaccine in Part\u00c2\u00a04. For complex cases,  referral to a physician with expertise in immunization or immunodeficiency is  advised. \nThe         antibody response to tetanus boosters given to adults with HIV or humoral         immune deficiencies is suboptimal. Tetanus immunity is lost in approximately 50%         of patients undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma or leukemia. \nRefer to Immunization of Immunocompromised Persons in Part 3 for additional general information.\nPeople with  neurological disorders with onset preceding immunization should receive all  routinely recommended immunizations, including tetanus toxoid-containing preparations.  Cases of  Guillain Barr\u00c3\u00a9 Syndrome (GBS) have been reported only very rarely following administration  of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, and the benefit of the vaccine normally  outweighs this very small risk.  Refer to Contraindications and Precautions for additional information. Refer to Immunization of Persons with Chronic Diseases in Part 3 for additional general information. \nUnimmunized or  incompletely immunized travellers should receive diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-polio-Hib-containing  vaccine as appropriate for age. Refer to Diphtheria Toxoid and Poliomyelitis Vaccine in Part\u00c2\u00a04 for  information regarding other  components in tetanus toxoid-containing combination vaccines. Refer to Immunization of Travellers in Part 3 for additional general information.\nHealth care providers who see people newly arrived in Canada         should review the immunization status and update immunization for these         individuals. Refer to Immunization of Persons New to Canada in Part 3 for additional general information.\nAll health care workers should be immune to tetanus and receive a booster  dose of Td vaccine every 10 years as recommended for all adults. All health  care and child care workers, regardless of age, should receive a single dose of  Tdap vaccine for pertussis protection if they have not been immunised previously  with this vaccine in adulthood, even if they are not due for a tetanus and  diphtheria booster. Refer to Immunization of Workers in Part 3 for  additional general information.\nThe most important goals of post-exposure  prophylaxis are removing the source of toxin production and neutralizing any  toxin which may have been released. The first goal is best achieved by timely,  thorough wound cleaning. The second goal is achieved by providing or inducing high  circulating concentrations of tetanus antibody, which inactivate the toxin.  Effective neutralizing antibody concentrations at the time of the injury can  only be achieved by prior completion of the tetanus toxoid-containing  vaccine series or immediate administration of tetanus immune globulin (TIg). \nIt is  important to ascertain the number of doses of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine  that an injured person previously has received, any severe reaction that they  have experienced with any previous dose, and the interval since the last dose. Post-exposure  prophylaxis of individuals who are unimmunized or incompletely immunized (unknown  or fewer than 3 doses) and who sustain more than a minor, clean wound, should  consist of both TIg and tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (as appropriate for  age and immunization history), given at different injection sites and using separate  needles and syringes. TIg provides immediate  passive protection until the exposed person mounts an immune response to the  tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine. The vaccine series should be completed subsequently  unless there is a contraindication. Refer to Table\u00c2\u00a01 for additional information. \nPreviously immunized  persons (3 or more doses) may require a booster dose of a tetanus toxoid-containing  vaccine, depending on the interval since the last booster and the type of wound.  A booster dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine is recommended if ten or  more years have elapsed for those with clean, minor wounds and if five or more  years have elapsed, for all other wounds. \nPeople who have a tetanus-prone injury and have experienced a severe  injection site reaction following a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine usually  have very high serum antitoxin levels and should not receive routine or emergency  booster doses of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine for 10 years following the  last dose. A tetanus-prone injury can be defined as an injury  significantly contaminated with material likely to contain tetanus spores (i.e.  soil, animal or human feces) or an injury with the presence of necrotic tissue. \nSome  individuals with humoral immune deficiency (e.g., HIV,  agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia) may not  respond adequately to tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine. Individuals with  humoral immune deficiency who have wounds that are not minor and clean should  receive both TIg and tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, regardless of the time  elapsed since the last booster. Table 1 summarizes the recommended use of immunizing agents in wound  management. \nPersons who have         recovered from tetanus disease should receive tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine         as recommended for people who not had the disease. Because         tetanus is caused by the toxins produced  by the tetanus bacterium and not by the         bacterium itself, recovery from tetanus disease does not confer immunity.\nTetanus         immune globulin (TIg) for prophylaxis\n         The         recommended dose of HYPERTET\u00c2\u00ae S\/D (TIg) for adults and children 7 years of age         and older is 250 units by deep intramuscular injection. In small children less         than 7 years old, the routine prophylactic dose of HYPERTET\u00c2\u00ae S\/D is 4 units\/kg.         However, it may be advisable to administer the entire contents of the vial or         syringe of HYPERTET\u00c2\u00ae S\/D (250 units)         regardless of the child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s size, since theoretically the same amount of toxin         will be produced in the child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body by the infecting tetanus organism as it         will in an adult\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body. \nTetanus immune globulin (TIg) for treatment \n         When used in the treatment of tetanus, TIg should be administered         intramuscularly in an effort to neutralize tetanus toxin in body fluids. It has         no effect on toxin already fixed to nerve tissue. The optimal therapeutic dose         has not been established. \nIntramuscular         injections are preferably administered in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm         or lateral thigh muscle. The gluteal muscle should not be used as an injection         site because of the risk of injury to the sciatic nerve.\nRefer to Vaccine  Safety for safety information. \nFor complete prescribing information, consult the product         leaflet or information contained within Health Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authorized product         monographs available through the Drug         Product Database. Refer to Passive Immunization Part         5 for additional general information.\nDose\n         Each dose of         tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine is 0.5 mL\nRoute of administration\n       Tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines must be administered intramuscularly. Refer  to Vaccine  Administration Practices in Part 1 for additional  information.\nInfants and children (2 months to 6 years of age)\nRoutine tetanus immunization of infants: DTaP-IPV-Hib         vaccine should be given at 2, 4, 6 and 12 to 23 months of age (generally given         at 18 months of age). \nIf         infant immunization for hepatitis B is undertaken, DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib vaccine may         be used as an alternative to separately administered hepatitis B and         DTaP-IPV-Hib vaccines. DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib vaccine is authorized for use in         children 6 weeks to 23 months of age and may be given to children aged 24         months to less than 7 years, if necessary. DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib         vaccine may be given at 2, 4, 6 and 12 to 23 months of age but the         fourth dose is unlikely to provide significant additional hepatitis B         protection and will increase cost. Alternative schedules may be used as follow:\nIf rapid protection is         required for an infant, the first dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib or         DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib vaccine can be         given at 6 weeks of age.         The first three doses may be         administered at intervals of 4 weeks         and, optimally, the fourth dose given 12 months after the third dose. The fourth dose may be given at a minimum interval of 6 months after         the third dose in certain situations (e.g., travel) but must be administered at or after 12 months of age for         sustained immunity. \nChildren less than 7 years of age not immunized in         infancy: should receive three doses of DTaP-IPV (with or without Hib)         vaccine with an interval of 8 weeks between doses, followed by a dose of         DTaP-IPV vaccine 6 to 12 months after the third dose. A booster dose of either         DTaP-IPV or Tdap-IPV vaccine should be administered at 4 to 6 years of age         (school entry). The booster dose at 4 to 6 years of age is not required if the         fourth dose of tetanus-toxoid containing vaccine was administered after the         fourth birthday.\nIf rapid protection is required for a child less than 7         years of age and not immunized in infancy, the first three doses of vaccine may be         administered at intervals of 4 weeks and, optimally, the fourth dose given 12         months after the third dose. The fourth dose may be given at a minimum interval         of 6 months after the third dose in certain situations (e.g., travel). \nChildren who received a primary series) of tetanus         toxoid-containing vaccine and a booster dose 6-12 months later as         outlined above should receive a booster dose of either DTaP-IPV or         Tdap-IPV vaccine at 4 to 6 years of age (school entry); and, 10 years later, a booster         dose of Tdap vaccine at 14 to 16 years of age. The booster dose at 4         to 6 years of age is not required if the fourth dose of tetanus-toxoid         containing vaccine was administered after the fourth birthday. \nChildren         and adolescents (7 years to 17 years of age)\nChildren 7 years of age and older, not previously immunized,         should receive three doses of Tdap-IPV vaccine with an interval of 8 weeks         between the first two doses followed by a third dose administered 6 to 12         months after the second dose. A booster dose of Tdap vaccine should be         administered 10 years after the last dose. \nAdults (18 years of age and older)\nAdults who have not previously         received a primary series (at least 3 doses) of tetanus toxoid-containing         vaccine should receive one dose of Tdap-IPV vaccine and two doses of Td-IPV vaccine.         The dose of Tdap-IPV vaccine should be given first,         followed 8 weeks later by a dose of Td-IPV vaccine. The second dose of Td-IPV vaccine         should be given 6 to 12 months after the previous dose of  Td-IPV vaccine.\nThe preschool booster dose of either DTaP-IPV or  Tdap-IPV vaccine should be administered at 4 to 6 years of age. Adolescents  should routinely receive a booster dose of Tdap vaccine at 14 to 16 years of  age.  Currently,         booster doses of Td vaccine are recommended every 10 years. There         is new evidence that booster doses of Td vaccine may not be required every 10         years and this evidence is currently under review. Adults who have not received         an adult dose of pertussis-containing vaccine should receive one         dose of Tdap vaccine, which can be administered regardless of the         interval since the last dose of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing         vaccine. Refer to Schedule.\nSerologic testing is not recommended before or after         receiving tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine.\nTetanus toxoid-containing preparations should be stored in a refrigerator at +2\u00c2\u00b0C to +8\u00c2\u00b0C and must not be frozen. Refer to Storage and Handling of Immunizing Agents in Part 1 for  additional general information. Refer to Passive Immunization in Part 5 for information regarding immune globulin storage. \nTetanus toxoid-containing vaccines may be administered  concomitantly with routine vaccines at different injection sites using separate  needles and syringes. Refer to Timing of Vaccine Administration in Part 1 for additional general information.\nRefer to Vaccine Safety in Part 2 for additional general information. Refer to Diphtheria Toxoid, Pertussis Vaccine, Poliomyelitis Vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b Vaccine and Hepatitis B Vaccine in Part 4 for additional information regarding other components in tetanus toxoid-containing combination vaccines.\nRedness, swelling  and pain at the injection site are the most common adverse reactions to  childhood tetanus toxoid-containing combination vaccines. A nodule may be  palpable at the injection site and persist for several weeks. Abscess at the  injection site has been reported. \u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u00a0These  events are most often related to administering the vaccine subcutaneously in error.\nIn clinical trials, injection site adverse  reactions, including tenderness, erythema, swelling, or any combination, were  reported in 10% to 40% of children after each of the first 3 doses of tetanus  toxoid-containing vaccine. Mild systemic reactions such as fever, irritability fussiness  or any combination were commonly reported (8% to 29%), as well as drowsiness  (40% to 52%).\nIn two clinical studies, swelling (greater than 5 cm) and         erythema were reported in 15 % to 20% of vaccinees after the fourth or fifth         doses of DTaP vaccines. Extensive limb swelling (greater than 10 cm in         diameter) possibly involving the entire proximal limb may occur in 2% to 6% of         children. While these injection site reactions produce significant swelling,         pain is generally limited. There is some evidence that children with extensive         limb swelling following the fourth dose of a DTaP vaccine are at increased risk         of such an event following the fifth dose. The presence of a large injection         site reaction to a previous dose is not a contraindication to continuing the         recommended schedule.\nAmong adults given a booster dose of Tdap vaccine, very         common reactions include pain, redness and swelling at the injection site,         headache, and fatigue. Fever and chills are common reactions. Adverse reactions         following Td vaccine are similar. Overall, adverse reactions are less common in         adults than adolescents. The interval between the childhood DTaP vaccine series         or a dose of Td vaccine, and a dose of Tdap vaccine does not affect the rate of         injection site or systemic adverse events.\nMild soreness at the injection site and slight         temperature elevation may occur following TIg injection. \nSerious adverse events are rare following immunization with         tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines and, in most cases, data are insufficient to         determine a causal association. Severe systemic         reactions such as generalized urticaria, anaphylaxis, or neurologic complications         have been reported rarely. \nSerum sickness, brachial plexus         neuropathy, encephalomyelitis and transverse myelitis have rarely been reported         in association with tetanus vaccination.\nSevere arthus-type injection site reactions are occasionally         reported following receipt of diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid-containing         vaccines. There may be extensive painful swelling around the injection site,         often involving the arm from shoulder to elbow and generally beginning 2 to 8         hours after injection. Such reactions are most often reported in adults,         particularly those who have received frequent doses of diphtheria or tetanus         toxoid-containing vaccines or both. Persons experiencing severe injection site reactions         usually have very high serum antitoxin concentrations and should not receive         further routine doses of Td vaccine for at least 10 years. \nAngioneurotic edema, nephrotic syndrome, and anaphylaxis         after injection have been reported rarely.\nTrismus (inability         to normally open the mouth) associated with tetanus toxoid immunization has         rarely been reported. The pathogenesis is unexplained and it may be attributable         to a reporting bias. Outcomes have been favourable.\nCases of Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 Syndrome (GBS) or polyneuritis have         been reported following administration of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine and         there has been one case report of relapsing GBS following each of three doses         of vaccine. However, population studies have not supported a causal association. \nVaccine providers are asked to report,         through local public health officials, any serious or unexpected adverse         event felt to be temporally related to vaccination. An unexpected AEFI is an event         that is not listed in available product information but may be due to the         immunization or a change in the frequency of a known AEFI. Refer to Reporting Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) in Canada in Vaccine  Safety Part 2 for additional information about AEFI reporting.\nTetanus toxoid-containing vaccines are contraindicated in         persons with a history of anaphylaxis after previous administration of the         vaccine and in persons with proven immediate or anaphylactic hypersensitivity to         any component of the vaccine or its container. Refer  to Contents  of Immunizing Agents Available for use in Canada in Part 1 for lists of all  vaccines and passive immunizing agents available for use in Canada and their  contents. For the tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines, potential  allergens include:\nThere are no         currently known potential allergens in ADACEL\u00c2\u00ae or Td ADSORBED         vaccines.\nHypersensitivity to yeast is very rare and a personal         history of yeast allergy is not generally reliable. In situations of suspected         hypersensitivity or non-anaphylactic allergy to vaccine components,         investigation is indicated, which may involve immunization in a controlled         setting. Consultation with an allergist is advised.\nAdministration of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine should be postponed in persons with severe acute illness. Persons with minor acute illness, with or without fever, may be vaccinated.\nIt is prudent to not administer         further doses of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine to persons who develop GBS         within 6 weeks of receiving such vaccine. Those who develop GBS outside the 6         week interval may receive subsequent doses of tetanus toxoid-containing         vaccine. If there is a history of both Campylobacter infection (which         has been associated with GBS) and receipt of a tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing         vaccine within the 6 weeks before the onset of GBS, consultation with an         infectious disease specialist is advised. \nPeople who experience a severe injection         site reaction following a dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine should not         be given another dose for at least 10 years. \nRefer to General  Contraindications and Precautions in Part 2 and Passive Immunization in Part 5 for additional general information.\nThe primary series of three doses tetanus         toxoid-containing vaccine should be completed with an appropriate vaccine from         the same manufacturer whenever possible. However, if the original vaccine is unknown         or unavailable, an alternative combination vaccine from a different         manufacturer may be used to complete the primary series. On the basis of expert         opinion, an appropriate product from any manufacturer can be used for all booster         doses. Refer to Principles of Vaccine Interchangeability in Part 1 for additional general information.\n","191":"President Donald Trump remains committed to investigating a link between vaccines and autism, and his staff are still in contact with environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about leading a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccine safety commission\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to investigate the issue, Kennedy told reporters Wednesday.\nKennedy, in his first comments on the proposed commission since meeting with Trump on Jan. 10, said he had met \u00e2\u20ac\u0153many times\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with members of the transition team and Trump staff since December, and they have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trading documents about what the commission would look like.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nKennedy, a leading proponent of the widely debunked theory that vaccines cause autism, said he spoke with Trump for 20 minutes on Jan. 4 and an hour with him at Trump Tower on Jan. 10. He said everyone in the room engaged in that discussion, including Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller and Vice President Mike Pence. \nTrump, who has long said he suspected vaccines caused autism, told Kennedy that he had five friends whose kids had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153changed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after receiving vaccines, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153said he wanted to make sure we had the safest vaccines and a regulatory process with integrity.\" \nKennedy made the comments at a news conference in Washington alongside actor Robert DeNiro, who's also questioned vaccine safety. The pair offered a $100,000 award to anyone who could point to a study showing that the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal was safe to vaccinate children and pregnant women. \nHowever, thimerosal was removed from most pediatric vaccines by 2001. Autism diagnosis rates continued to increase for children born after that.\nKennedy said Trump staffers, following his high-profile meeting with Trump, originally urged him to talk about the commission, but they called that evening to say they had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gotten out over our skis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and had to give a more ambiguous statement about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. However, Kennedy said he has been contacted twice since that meeting and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they say they are still going forward with it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president told me, 'I know the pharma industry is going to cause an uproar about this, and try to make me back down, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to back down,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kennedy said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u2122They tried during the campaign and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back down and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to back down.'\"\nThe commission would be made up of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Americans of the highest integrity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who had not previously taken a position on the vaccine safety issue, Kennedy said. They might include corporate CEOs and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doctors on television,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The commission would investigate CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of vaccine safety and conflicts of interest at the agency.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nTrump continues to show an interest in the autism issue. At a meeting with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and teachers on Tuesday, he spoke of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous increase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in autism diagnoses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such an incredible \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really a horrible thing to watch.\" \nScientists are unsure whether autism has actually increased in recent decades or is just better diagnosed. A number of federal agencies already oversee vaccine safety. \n","192":"Before and during his campaign, President Donald Trump repeatedly linked vaccines to autism, despite the fact that the claim has been debunked.\nAt a 2015 Republican presidential candidate debate, CNN anchor Jake Tapper asked Trump how, if elected, he would handle overseeing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of Health, which both disagree with his stance on vaccinations.\nTrump responded: \"Autism has become an epidemic\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I am totally in favor of vaccines. But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.\"\nWhen it comes to the vaccination schedule, the White House has limited control.\nFederal recommendations on the schedule are chosen through the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Members on the committee must go through a rigorous application process and are ultimately appointed to four-year terms by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department secretary, a position currently held by former U.S. Rep. Tom Price.\nEven though the CDC's immunization schedule could possibly have some influence on state laws, the schedule and other CDC recommendations are not federal requirements.\nAs of February 2017, all states require immunizations as a condition of enrollment in public school and, in many cases, private school. However, depending on the state, parents can exempt their children from immunizations for medical or philosophical reasons.\nIn response to a question about implementing federal immunization requirements during his tenure, Price acknowledged in March that state governments tend to make those decisions, but evaded a question about whether vaccines should be required.\n\"I believe it's a perfectly appropriate role for the government -- this happens, by and large, at the state government level, because they're the ones that have the public health responsibility -- to determine whether or not immunizations are required for a community population,\" Price said during a CNN town hall event.\nIt is unclear where Price stands on vaccines. He agreed during his confirmation hearing that science has debunked the autism link, but he has also been a member of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a group that believes in a link between vaccines and autism.\nBecause the federal government doesn't decide state immunization laws, changes to the CDC vaccination schedule won't necessarily result in any changes to vaccination requirements. Price could end up having some influence on the vaccination schedule through his Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices member appointments. But terms on the 15-member committee are staggered, meaning Price could only select a few members per presidential term.\nIt will be difficult for Trump to implement this promise, and we've seen no indication that Trump or Price intends to aggressively push for it. Since we've found no action on this promise, for now we rate it Stalled.\nCNN, Transcript of second 2016 Republican presidential candidate debate, Sept. 16, 2015\nCNN, \"DHHS Secretary Tom Price in Town Hall Meeting on Health Care,\" Mar. 15, 2017\nC-SPAN, \"Health and Human Services Secretary Confirmation Hearing,\" Jan. 24, 2017\nPolitiFact, \"Megyn Kelly: Measles vaccine safety is settled science,\" Feb. 3, 2015\nWashington Post, \"Tom Price belongs to a doctors group with unorthodox views on government and health care,\" Feb. 9, 2017\n","193":"For those parents worried about the health ramifications surrounding \"anti-vaxxer\" theories and the long-belabored debate over the safety of vaccinations, a recently resurfaced tweet from President-elect Donald Trump is certainly not about to diminish concerns. Nor is his latest appointment.\nThe tweet, posted in 2014, isn't the only time Trump has spoken out against vaccines or blamed them for causing autism. He has been vocal about the topic for years and also openly discussed such sentiments during his campaign at the Republican debate in September 2015:\n\"You take this little beautiful baby and you pump . . . \" he said, referring to mandatory childhood vaccines. \"We had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, 2 years old, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\"\nHis latest move toward further prolonging discussion of the widely discredited theory came today when he asked Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who shares similar beliefs that immunizations harm children and has led efforts to roll back child vaccination laws \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to chair a new commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity.\nAlthough Trump officials have not confirmed the appointment, Kennedy told the press he accepted the position.\n\"President-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies and he has questions about it,\" Kennedy said. \"He says his opinion doesn't matter . . . but the science does matter, and we ought to be reading the science and we ought to be debating the science.\"\nIf that's the case, there's unequivocally no room for debate: vaccines do not cause autism. The only study ever linking vaccines to autism, which was published in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield (whose medical license has since been revoked), has been revealed as not only baseless but also outright fraudulent. \nEvery single study following it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d because it became such a controversial, global topic (thanks, Jenny McCarthy!) that dozens of scientists from the CDC to the New England Journal of Medicine began diligent, longitudinal research to address the issue \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is consistent: there is no link. Vaccines and autism are unrelated. One does not cause the other.\nSo, please, read that science. And then think if it's really worth spending more time and money debating said science, when there are hundreds more pressing, more debilitating public health crises that would actually benefit from this type of attention. Above all, though, let's all please \u00e2\u20ac\u201d on behalf of parents who've watched their newborns contract measles, mumps, and other once-eradicated life-threatening illnesses \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stop debating this topic because the very act of doing so is creating a public health crisis all its own.\n","194":"After deciding not to allow LO to be vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, I took LO to a private medical practice for his single measles vacation today.  The clinic is owned by an ex NHS consultant paediatrician, is full of toys and very very relaxed.  They made us both feel very at ease, showed me the vials before they were used and then used what they told me were special paediatric needles so small that the idea is the child feels only pressure, not pain.\n I can only go on previous experience - that being one very distressed baby, and a health visitor herding us in like cattle to stick very thick needles into LOs thigh, leaving red angry marks and an obviously sore leg.  Not this time, LO was playing with some toys in the consulting room when everything was being explained to me, when the time came I simply picked him up, pulled down his trousers, he wasn't held down or forced down as he has been previously, he had the jab (without it being corkscrewed in like usual), stayed nice and calm then went back to play with his toys.  No fear, no stress, no tears!!\n There's no way we're going back to the health visitor for ANY of LOs jabs now.  There's no need for the upset it causes each time.  People have told me I'm mad to pay for single vaccines when i can get it combined on the NHS, but today i spent the best money I've ever spent. LOs comfort is worth more than money, and im so pleased I made the decision I did \nIt really does make a difference doesn't it?! I think I was branded a trouble maker by our HV when I asked her questions she really couldn't be arsed with answering the first time we went.  I know they're busy but on 'vaccination day' at our surgery, the babies are lined up outside and rushed through.  No care, no time given, they all scream without fail and the who,e experience is horrible for all involved.  Regardless of my stance on the MMR, it was so nice and refreshing to have someone genuinely seem to care for the well being of your child.  Such a pity I had to pay to get it when all LOs deserve that level of care as standard\n but what is absolutely certain, and written on the 'side effects' section of the pamphlet you get with the combined MMR, is that it can cause auto-immune disorders in people.  so if you or your family are susceptible to them, its best to avoid\nI've pulled apart the research into MMR and the autism link at least 5 times. Each time I've found more and more evidence against Wakefields study. \n I can vouch for some of his other statements regarding auto-immune disorders and certain bowl disorders. But it's a slim vouch. \n The problem people have is, we're so 'up for' blaming others for every little thing. I specialised in austism with community care and so many of the mums I've worked with blame the vaccine BUT Austic traits are first noticable at the age or the vaccine and slightly afterwards, I worked closely with a family who had two sons with autism, one born in '94 and one born in '00. The older child had the MMR vaccine and they were told (as to research at the time) the vaccine had caused the austism. The younger child DID NOT, yet has Asperges. The were then told the youngests asperges was caused by the MMR vaccine. But he'd never had it. His mother had refused it. \n Theres more links to Autism and Asperges being a genetic link and usually if you watch a family with one person who is 'affected' enough to be diagnosed, the rest of the family will show autistic traits. Not enough for most to notice, but those who generally dislike social functions, keep a small network of friends but aren't particulary close to any one friend, unusual confidence with strangers (usually when talking over one subject, 'nervous' jibberish as it can seem).\n I made it my business to know this study inside out and have followed it religiously. New clients come onto my lists wanting to know why and if it was something they did. Short answer is no. Theres no blame, you could blame yourself for letting your child have the vaccine, but you could for not! If the study have a strong enough backbone, don't you think the combined vaccine would have been pulled YEARS ago? Wakefield was pushing the idea onto others way back in the early '90's and if the risks outweighed the benefits, it would have been pulled by either the NHS or the government. Let's face it, the government have to pay more towards a SEN child's education then that of a mainstream, they don't like having to take money from pointless budgets and giving it to causes that need it. \n End of the day it is the parents choice over the vaccine, but either way don't feel guilty about it or anything else you choose your child to have or do! The only opinions that truely matter are that of your own, seriously though, any doubt and speak to your GP, HV or a specialist in the subject (or if you can get your hands on an unbiased reading source). It's a shame alot of leaflets are designed by nature to express the authors beliefs and persuade you to their way of thinking, even the ones you pick up in the doctors clinics are the same, it's hard to truely write from an unbiased point of view. \n","195":"U.S. public health officials and physicians have been combating misconceptions about vaccine safety for over twenty years. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had mixed success. Despite the fact that numerous studies have found no evidence to support the notion that vaccines cause autism and other chronic illnesses, a growing number of parents are refusing to vaccinate their children.\nResearchers now link falling immunization rates to recent resurgences of vaccine-preventable diseases. In 2010, California saw 9,120 cases of whooping cough, more than any year since the whooping cough vaccine was introduced in the 1940s. Ten infants too young to be vaccinated died of whooping cough during the outbreak. The CDC warns that events like these will become more frequent and harder to control if vaccination rates continue to fall.\nFears over the safety of vaccines are understandable. The CDC vaccination schedule calls for children to receive up to 14 inoculations by the age of six \u00e2\u20ac\u201c many of them vaccines developed within the last twenty years. Many parents distrust these vaccines; worried about the potential for risks and long-term side effects. Research, however, shows that most of our biggest fears about vaccinations are unfounded. These eight major vaccine myths that research has shown to be baseless: \nMyth #1: Vaccines cause autism.\nThe widespread fear that vaccines increase risk of autism originated with a 1997 study published by Andrew Wakefield, a British surgeon. The article was published in The Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, suggesting that the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine was increasing autism in British children.\nThe paper has since been completely discredited due to serious procedural errors, undisclosed financial conflicts of interest, and ethical violations. Andrew Wakefield lost his medical license and the paper was retracted from The Lancet.\nNonetheless, the hypothesis was taken seriously, and several other major studies were conducted. None of them found a link between any vaccine and the likelihood of developing autism.\nToday, the true causes of autism remain a mystery, but to the discredit of the autism-vaccination link theory, several studies have now identified symptoms of autism in children well before they receive the MMR vaccine. And even more recent research provides evidence that autism develops in utero, well before a baby is born or receives vaccinations.\nMyth #2: Infant immune systems can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handle so many vaccines.\nInfant immune systems are stronger than you might think. Based on the number of antibodies present in the blood, a baby would theoretically have the ability to respond to around 10,000 vaccines at one time. Even if all 14 scheduled vaccines were given at once, it would only use up slightly more than 0.1% of a baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune capacity. And scientists believe this capacity is purely theoretical. The immune system could never truly be overwhelmed because the cells in the system are constantly being replenished. In reality, babies are exposed to countless bacteria and viruses every day, and immunizations are negligible in comparison.\nThough there are more vaccinations than ever before, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccines are far more efficient. Small children are actually exposed to fewer immunologic components overall than children in past decades.\nMyth #3: Natural immunity is better than vaccine-acquired immunity.\nIn some cases, natural immunity \u00e2\u20ac\u201d meaning actually catching a disease and getting sick\u00e2\u20ac\u201c results in a stronger immunity to the disease than a vaccination. However, the dangers of this approach far outweigh the relative benefits. If you wanted to gain immunity to measles, for example, by contracting the disease, you would face a 1 in 500 chance of death from your symptoms. In contrast, the number of people who have had severe allergic reactions from an MMR vaccine, is less than one-in-one million.\nMyth #4: Vaccines contain unsafe toxins.\nPeople have concerns over the use of formaldehyde, mercury or aluminum in vaccines. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that these chemicals are toxic to the human body in certain levels, but only trace amounts of these chemicals are used in FDA approved vaccines. In fact, according to the FDA and the CDC, formaldehyde is produced at higher rates by our own metabolic systems and there is no scientific evidence that the low levels of this chemical, mercury or aluminum in vaccines can be harmful.  See section III of this guide to review safety information about these chemicals and how they are used in vaccines. \nMyth #5: Better hygiene and sanitation are actually responsible for decreased infections, not vaccines.\nVaccines don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deserve all the credit for reducing or eliminating rates of infectious disease. Better sanitation, nutrition, and the development of antibiotics helped a lot too. But when these factors are isolated and rates of infectious disease are scrutinized, the role of vaccines cannot be denied.\nOne example is measles in the United States. When the first measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, rates of infection had been holding steady at around 400,000 cases a year. And while hygienic habits and sanitation didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change much over the following decade, the rate of measles infections dropped precipitously following the introduction of the vaccine, with only around 25,000 cases by 1970. Another example is Hib disease. According to CDC data, the incidence rate for this malady plummeted from 20,000 in 1990 to around 1,500 in 1993, following the introduction of the vaccine. \nMyth #6: Vaccines aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the risk.\nDespite parent concerns, children have been successfully vaccinated for decades. In fact, there has never been a single credible study linking vaccines to long term health conditions. \nAs for immediate danger from vaccines, in the form of allergic reactions or severe side effects, the incidence of death are so rare they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even truly be calculated. For example, only one death was reported to the CDC between 1990 and 1992 that was attributable to a vaccine. The overall incidence rate of severe allergic reaction to vaccines is usually placed around one case for every one or two million injections.\nMyth #7: Vaccines can infect my child with the disease it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trying to prevent.\nVaccines can cause mild symptoms resembling those of the disease they are protecting against. A common misconception is that these symptoms signal infection. In fact, in the small percentage (less than 1 in one million cases) where symptoms do occur, the vaccine recipients are experiencing a body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune response to the vaccine, not the disease itself. There is only one recorded instance in which a vaccine was shown to cause disease. This was the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) which is no longer used in the U.S. Since then, vaccines have been in safe use for decades and follow strict Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.\nMyth #8: We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to vaccinate because infection rates are already so low in the United States.\nThanks to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so long as a large majority of people are immunized in any population, even the unimmunized minority will be protected. With so many people resistant, an infectious disease will never get a chance to establish itself and spread. This is important because there will always be a portion of the population \u00e2\u20ac\u201c infants, pregnant women, elderly, and those with weakened immune systems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive vaccines.\nBut if too many people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate themselves or their children, they contribute to a collective danger, opening up opportunities for viruses and bacteria to establish themselves and spread.\nNot to mention, as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) warn, international travel is growing quickly, so even if a disease is not a threat in your country, it may be common elsewhere. If someone were to carry in a disease from abroad, an unvaccinated individual will be at far greater risk of getting sick if he or she is exposed.\nVaccines are one of the great pillars of modern medicine. Life used to be especially brutal for children before vaccines, with huge portions being felled by diseases like measles, smallpox, whooping cough, or rubella, to name just a few. Today these ailments can be completely prevented with a simple injection. \nSo as science continues to advance and tackle new challenges, people should not forget how many deaths and illnesses vaccines have prevented, and how they continue to protect us from potentially devastating forms of infectious disease.\n","196":"There are many articles already published showing why the fantasy-film, Vaxxed, is an abomination of anti-vaccination propaganda based deeply within the conspiratorial minds of its creators and those who lap it up. For an excellent compendium of such articles, please see our friends at Losing in the Lucky Country:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVaxxed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Debunked \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a selection of\u00c2\u00a0references:\nThere is absolutely no doubt that the fraudumentary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is demonstrably bogus nonsense.\nIt is also potentially very harmful nonsense and as such deserves to be debunked when the opportunity arises. There are a huge number of references that outline just why, and indeed how, this intellectual revulsion is firmly discredited by evidence. More so, there are a range of approaches presented in various critiques. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a result of authors seeking to be creative. Rather the final product of\u00c2\u00a0Vaxxed\u00c2\u00a0is so egregiously wrong on so many levels, it can be nudged into a pile of rubble from so many angles.\nRecently, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen how official Vaxxed New Zealand spokesperson \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and child abuser \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sarah Cox, called for the execution of award-winning journalist, Brian Deer. We also saw how the official Bring Vaxxed to Australia\/New Zealand Facebook group \u00e2\u20ac\u201c run by AVN president Tasha David \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was used to attack and vilify the mother of deceased baby boy, Riley Hughes, and the Light for Riley campaign.\nToday, I want to allow the creators and promoters of Vaxxed to speak for themselves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to show that the movie is, as opposed to their own claims to the contrary, anti-vaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c via a series of very short videos contained in my\u00c2\u00a0Vaxxed\u00c2\u00a0Greatest Hits YouTube playlist. It is worth watching the videos, now featured below; many of them are under one minute long; and they all retain the context in which the excerpts first appeared.\nAnti-vaccination activists need to obfuscate. They know the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stinks. They will do anything to deny that what they are doing is anti-vaccine. Wakefield even disingenuously states, in Vaxxed, that a regime of safe immunisation is a laudable notion. We know he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean it. We know that Wakefield and his personality-cult do not think that there are any safe vaccines. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about as supportive of immunisation as\u00c2\u00a0Vaxxed gets.\nIn press conferences, held at the time of the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release, the creators were adamant that the film was not anti-vaccine.\nThe vanity-film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s star, producer, and director,\u00c2\u00a0Andrew Wakefield stated:\nThe film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s star and producer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Foghorn Leghorn impersonator \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0Del Bigtree stated:\nThe film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distributor, Cinema Libre chairman,\u00c2\u00a0Philippe Diaz stated:\nInterestingly, this clip from Vaxxed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0of Andrew Wakefield stating that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153every healthy child in the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is at risk of autism from vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c gives their game away:\nAnother common lie told about the film, by its promoters and devotees, is that the film is solely about the MMR vaccine, and not about any others.

Although the bulk of the film is dedicated to the debunked CDC\/MMR conspiracy theory, it is clear that whooping cough immunisation is also falsely blamed for causing autism, as well as other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mercury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toxin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd containing vaccines, vaccines given at 6 months of age (which cannot be the MMR), and even the Gardasil vaccine is mentioned (it is seen in document form on the computer screen of anti-vaccination activist, Brandy Vaughan):\nAdding to the antivax credentials of the film is the latest official campaign from the filmmakers, teaming up with Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier, disreputable, discredited, callous anti-vaccination organisation, the Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an organisation which has the dubious honour of having a public health warning issued against it for its rampant, dishonest anti-vaccinationism \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in this new antivax caravan of carnage:\nAlso busily plugging the new, national liefest across the internet is AVN founder Meryl Dorey, herself\u00c2\u00a0known for many hideous acts, among them stating that vaccination is the same as the rape of a child:\nEven less than one month ago, the official Vaxxed Facebook page shared this defiantly antivax video from US antivaxer Marcella Piper-Terry, a person more well-known among evidence-based readers as the person who also declared that vaccination is the same as rape:\nThe whole Vaxxed campaign is anti-vaccine.

Even if you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that post (perhaps instead having seen this one), you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve probably seen the news reports describing how last fall the observation of a large number of cases of microcephaly, characterized by an abnormally small head and delayed brain development, in Brazil led researchers investigating the problem to suspect a link to a virus. That virus, the Zika virus, as you recall, is a mosquito-borne flavivirus related to dengue virus and transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (photo source here). On the surface, this virus would appear to be a relatively benign virus, with 80% of its infections being asymptomatic and infections in the other 20% manifesting themselves as a self-limited, relatively mild flu-like viral illness characterized by fever, rash, arthralgia (joint aches), and conjunctivitis. Then came the evidence that prenatal infection might cause microcephaly.\nAs I discussed in my first post, the epidemiological link between Zika virus and microcephaly is not a slam dunk by any stretch of the imagination. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not even clear that there has been a major spike in incidence of microcephaly in Brazil. However, the evidence thus far is definitely sufficient to be suggestive of a link, such that further investigation is certainly warranted and perhaps precautions for women in the affected areas would be wise. None of this uncertainty has stopped the conspiracy theorists, of course. As we will see, the bizarre conspiracies are still coming. Perhaps the oddest of them are the ones from antivaccinationists, including a crank group of physicians that I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discussed in a while. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get to them in a moment.\n First, however, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but mention that the CDC has published a new report on Zika virus for its latest issue of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), Notes from the Field: Evidence of Zika Virus Infection in Brain and Placental Tissues from Two Congenitally Infected Newborns and Two Fetal Losses \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Brazil, 2015. This report describes the result of Zika virus assays developed by the CDC for testing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. (This is what pathologists routinely do to fix any tissue removed during biopsies or surgery.) In December, the CDC tested tissues from two newborns with microcephaly who died within 20 hours of birth and  two miscarriages (fetal loss at 11 and 13 weeks). They all came from the state of Rio Grande do Norte in Brazil, and all four mothers had had clinical signs of Zika virus infection, complete with  fever and rash, during the first trimester of pregnancy but had no signs of active infection at the time of delivery or miscarriage. Tissues subjected to testing included brain and other autopsy tissues from the two newborns, a placenta from one of the newborns, and products of conception from the two miscarriages.\nThese tissues were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) directed at the gene for the nonstructural protein 5 and envelope genes using commonly used methods for RT-PCR. Tissues were also subjected to immunohistochemistry (using antibodies to identify specific proteins in tissues) using an anti-Zika virus antibody. This is what the CDC found:\n For both newborns, significant histopathologic changes were limited to the brain, and included parenchymal calcification, microglial nodules, gliosis, and cell degeneration and necrosis. Other autopsy tissues and placenta had no significant findings. Tests for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and HIV were negative in the two mothers who experienced miscarriages. Placental tissue from one miscarriage showed heterogeneous chorionic villi with calcification, fibrosis, perivillous fibrin deposition, and patchy intervillositis and focal villitis, while tissue from the other miscarriage had sparsely sampled normal-appearing chorionic villi.\nIn other words, the brains showed evidence of cellular degeneration and necrosis (cell death), and the placenta from one of the miscarriages had evidence of inflammation. The importance of these findings is that it shows that the Zika virus can infect the fetus when the mother is infected and that it appears to favor infecting the brain. Obviously, only four individuals are not enough to draw any sort of generalizable conclusions about prenatal Zika virus infection, but these results do provide evidence for biological plausibility of the hypothesis that prenatal Zika virus infection might be causing an outbreak of microcephaly. Still, there are many questions, such as why there haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been outbreaks like this before, given that Zika virus has been endemic in many areas since at least the 1950s and there have been outbreaks of Zika virus before in Africa, southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands, as well as several countries in Central and South America where Zika virus outbreaks are currently being reported. Yet, despite how widespread the virus is, there haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been reports of increased incidence of microcephaly before this.\nAs I said the first time I discussed this issue, the whole question of whether Zika virus is causing microcephaly is complicated. Of course, if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one thing that attracts answers that are simple and wrong, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complex epidemiological questions about whether a given putative etiological agent is actually causing the disease or condition that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suspected of causing. No wonder antivaccine loons are all over the case! Sure, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the usual nonsense about how Zika virus is nothing more than a fake disease invented by an unholy cabal of the CDC, big pharma, and the World Health Organization (WHO), apparently all in order to contribute to Bill Gates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 global depopulation campaign, but one of the dumber antivaccine conspiracy theorists, the pseudonymous Levi Quackenboss, couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist asking:\nOf course, Quackenboss forgot the most awesome conspiracy theory about Zika virus I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard thus far, that the cause is genetically modified mosquitos that I discussed in my last post. Not surprisingly, Quackenboss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 answers to all three questions are yes, yes, and yes. She goes on about how Brazil uses a lot of pesticides, which if true is not good of course. She discusses voltage-gated sodium channels in a manner that amused me, because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so clear that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just showing off to his fellow antivaxers that she knows science, ma-an\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor at least thinks she does. Truly, the arrogance of ignorance engendered by the Dunning-Kruger effect is strong in this one. (Ironically, I gave a talk to an ion channel conference held in London in September and have a grant to look at voltage-gated sodium channel function\u00e2\u20ac\u201damong other things\u00e2\u20ac\u201das a potential target for breast cancer therapy; so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m geeking out here. I also know a lot about certain sodium channels.) It turns out that specific pesticides disrupt voltage-gated sodium channel function, something that is well known. It also turns out that Quackenboss found an eleven year old review article that points this out and also notes that anticonvulsants (many of which interfere with voltage-gated sodium channel function) have been associated with birth defects, including microcephaly. Not surprisingly, Quackenboss neglects to mention the other part of the article that give the caveat, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there are currently no data to suggest that developmental exposure to pyrethroids [pesticides] results in similar effects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Typical.\nAlso not surprisingly, Quackenboss points out that a Zika virus vaccine is in the pipeline and being pushed out as fast as possible. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understandable, of course. Before, there was little incentive because the disease was thought to be a disease that made few people more ill than a self-limited viral illness. Add the potential for birth defects if pregnant women are infected, and the urgency of a vaccine increases by at least an order of magnitude. Predictably, though, to Quackenboss insinuates that the Zika scare is all about pushing this vaccine through the pipeline faster, the better to enrich our pharma overlords.\nHowever, to an antivaccine loon, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always first and foremost about the vaccines. (Always and forever, amen.) So the conclusion Quackenboss comes to is about as unsurprising as can be:\nThis is a particularly dumb conspiracy theory, but, then, Quackenboss is an antivaccinationist. If Tdap is causing microcephaly, one wonders why, then, there haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been outbreaks of microcephaly in the US, where the CDC has recommended the Tdap vaccine for pregnant women since 2011. Also, the Tdap is recommended in the third trimester, between weeks 27 and 36. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long after microcephaly develops, as the standard recommendation to detect microcephaly is to do an ultrasound late in the second trimester or early in the third. In other words, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no biological plausibility in blaming microcephaly on the Tdap vaccine because by the time the vaccine is routinely administered, microcephaly has already developed. Not that that stops Quackenboss from characterizing the association of microcephaly with Zika virus infection as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a misdiagnosed non-epidemic of probable pesticide poisoning and vaccine injury fueled by an American media bored with talking about Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s email server.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As I pointed out last time, Tdap is safe for pregnant women.\nTruly, the stupid, it burns.\nOf course, I expect this sort of pseudoscientific nonsense from a twit like Quackenboss. I do not expect it from a physician. Unfortunately, all too frequently I do get this sort of stuff from a physician, which is why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never completely retired my schtick about putting a paper bag over my head when physicians say stupid things. In this case, the physician is Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve met Dr. Orient the AAPS before, of course, dating back a long time. It is an organization of physician-cranks (or, if you prefer, crank physicians) that is known for being against vaccine mandates, Medicare (calling it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unconstitutional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), and  any form of regulation of health care by government. To top it off, the AAPS has characterized public health programs as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tyranny.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It has also published brain-meltingly bad papers claiming to find that abortion causes breast cancer, has promoted the vile idea that shaken baby syndrome is a misdiagnosis for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccine injury,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd supported HIV\/AIDS denialism, and\u00e2\u20ac\u201dof course!\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddone what all crank medical organizations like to do, attack evidence- and science-based medicine as placing unacceptable limits on physician autonomy. Worse, the AAPS doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even limit itself to medicine in that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also published papers attacking anthropogenic global climate change, as though physicians have the necessary expertise to assess climate science. Truly, the crank magnetism and arrogance of the AAPS know no bounds.\nDr. Orient wastes no time demonstrating these traits in her article published\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhere else?\u00e2\u20ac\u201don WorldNetDaily entitled Zika Virus: What Should We Do About It? I sought it out because, being on the AAPS mailing list, I received a notification of Dr. Orient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s article. Not surprisingly, in it Dr. Orient cites what she calls some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153interesting facts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd:\nI can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but note here that Dr. Orient actually one-ups the pseudonymous antivaccine loon Quackenboss by coming up with two\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtwo!\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddifferent antivaccine conspiracies to blame the increase in cases of microcephaly on instead of Zika virus. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to do. Instead of just blaming Tdap, she blames the MMR vaccine as well through a tenuous link with congenital rubella syndrome. Of course, many many millions of doses of MMR have been given with no observed association with an increase in birth defects consistent with congenital rubella syndrome. (One notes that congenital rubella syndrome is also associated with autism.) Quite the opposite, in fact. In the US, congenital rubella syndrome has been virtually eliminated, thanks to widespread vaccination with MMR. Seriously, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think that Dr. Orient could come up with a more plausible way to link the MMR to microcephaly. That she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t should tell you a lot about the science supporting her other claims about vaccines; i.e., there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any.\nWorse, Dr. Orient can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get her facts right. DTaP is the vaccine given to children. Tdap is the vaccine given to adults. Tdap is what Brazil started recommending for pregnant women beginning in 2014, because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the adult version of the vaccine. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also incorrect that there are no studies documetning the safety of the Tdap vaccine in pregnant women. Then, again, there is the aforementioned basic biological implausibility of the hypothesis that Tdap causes microcephaly based on simple embryology and the timing of the vaccination in the third trimester. None of this stops Dr. Orient from plumbing the depths of medical ignorance, though:\nIn fact, in this conclusion, consistent with her role in the AAPS she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist engaging in a bit of politics, including a little Rachel Carson revisionism. What do I mean by that? Simple. The above paragraph is the final paragraph in her piece; reading it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you what she means by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153effective mosquito control.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, earlier Dr. Orient spelled out what she meant:\nWow. Anthropogenic climate change denial, demonization of immigrants, and Rachel Carson revisionism, all in one scientifically ignorant package!\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read Merchants of Doubt by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be aware that there has been a renewed concerted effort to discredit Rachel Carson, which is what I mean when I refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carson revisionism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The original effort, of course, occurred immediately after the publication of her highly popular and influential anti-pesticide book Silent Spring and involved the pesticide and chemical industries. However, over the last decade or so, the story of Rachel Carson has been subjected to historical revisionism by the very same people who tried to deny the science demonstrating the harmful health effects of tobacco and who more recently have spearheaded anthropogenic climate change denialism.\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beyond the scope of this post to go into detail about the new Rachel Carson revisionism (although I have touched on it before and might do so again in more detail some day), but suffice to say that it involves a narrative in which, because of the anti-pesticide and anti-DDT fervor ignited by her book that led to the banning of DDT in the US, and, if you believe the narrative, in the rest of the world, millions died of malaria that DDT could have saved. Indeed, in a speech railing against climate science, dismissing secondhand tobacco smoke as harmless, and characterizing environmentalism as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153religion,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the arch crank himself, Michael Crichton, characterized the DDT ban as having \u00e2\u20ac\u0153caused the deaths of tens of millions of poor people, mostly children, whose deaths are directly attributable to a callous, technologically advanced western society that promoted the new cause of environmentalism by pushing a fantasy about a pesticide, and thus irrevocably harmed the third world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In his novel State of Fear, Crichton even had one of his characters say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Banning DDT killed more people than Hitler.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He even put the death toll at 50 million. Tellingly, the plot of State of Fear involved eco-terrorists plotting mass murder to publicize the dangers of global warming. No wonder Chris Mooney described the novel as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pure porn for global warming deniers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one problem with the revisionist narrative pushed by Crichton before his death and still being promoted by conservative free market-friendly think tanks like the Heartland Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Although Rachel Carson was certainly not correct about everything (for instance, the evidence linking DDT and cancer turned out to be fairly weak, even over 50 years later), nonetheless this revisionist narrative is demonstrably a load of fetid dingos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 kidneys promoted by the likes of not just Crichton but Steve Milloy, who never met an anti-environmentalism myth he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like, DDT included. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rachel Carson killed more people than Hitler\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd myth is basically a zombie myth that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t die. In reality, DDT use peaked before Silent Spring and DDT use was decreasing because mosquitos were developing resistance. Sadly, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a myth that skeptics who should know better not infrequently fall for, sometimes people I never would have guessed as being susceptible to such messages.\nSo, if you believe antivaccinationists, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Zika virus that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s causing a surge in cases of microcephaly in Brazil, but\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsurprise! surprise!\u00e2\u20ac\u201dvaccines. And if you believe Dr. Orient and her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brave maverick doctor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pals at the AAPS, the cure is to stop vaccinating reproductive age women, fire up the DDT plants again, and start spraying. Both of them, of course, agree that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all the fault of big pharma, which eager to sell a new vaccine against Zika virus, also pushes ever more and more vaccines in order to maximize profits. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all logical\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a an antivaccine warrior.

I feel I am too, more objective than most on many issues. I have always tried to focus on the evidence rather than the rhetoric.\n There is no credible evidence that Zika causes micro encephalitic births. There is much credible evidence that aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate, especially in combination with ethyl mercury (not a listed ingredient, but still present in all vaccines, due to its continued use to preserve component ingredients) do cause severe brain damage in adults let alone a fetus with no blood- brain barrier yet formed. All these and more toxins are in the DTaP shot.\n How is it that the WHO and CDC have recently given the green light to vaccinating pregnant women, a previously unheard of practice in medicine!\n Now correct me if I am wrong here, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the placenta prevent most pathogens from entering the fetus? Whereas much smaller micro nutrients have to pass through, therefore toxic chemicals also can. Like I said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure about this, need to research more.\n Finally I recommend all you doctors out there re- educate yourselves on Dr Edward Jenna and his work with smallpox, as he is generally referred to as the inventor of modern vaccination. It would appear that his method has been reversed and we vaccinate by injection and not by varolation  as he did. In fact he did use an injection of live small pox virus to TEST his vaccine. This injection would have been 100% lethal to even the healthiest person, which is why he chose such a severe test. Lucky for his subject his hypothesis that cowpox immunity = smallpox immunity was indeed correct and his subject survived without any symptoms of smallpox. The practice of injecting vaccines makes no scientific sense, because it completely bypasses the immune system and delivers the virus into the general bloodstream. As this practically never happens naturally (except for snakebites), our immune systems are not evolved to deal with this situation. They are however very good at dealing with pathogens entering our nose mouth and skin, which happens all the time. because of this an injected vaccine would not even trigger an immune response unless it was a live vaccine, but these are too dangerous to use in this way, so we use a dead virus, and in order to get an immune response adjuvicants are added, these have to be neuro toxins of some kind, aluminum salts being the most common., they cause a catastrophic shock reaction  of our immune system and eventually lead to auto-immune diseases, which were rare or non existent before modern vaccination. As you can see this method is fundamentally flawed and very harmful, not to mention utterly pointless, when the vaccine could be administered safely either orally, nasally or through the top layer of skin as in varolation as was the practice in Jenna\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day. In fact the only conceivable point to injecting vaccines at all, would be to make them as harmful as possible to our brain and nervous systems. Unfortunately as most all of us have had multiple vaccines, we are so lobotomized that few have the intelligence to figure this out.\n So here  for what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth is my conspiracy theory about the Zika virus. First off, like Ebola and other biological weapons developed during the cold war years, it has a patent #. So it is man made, but it is far from lethal, so why was it made? Well maybe because it spreads so quickly and can be introduced by releasing a few infected mosquitoes, quickly reaching epidemic proportions in tropical regions, but for what purpose? Well, scare tactics and as a cover for vaccine damage. You see, the real powers that be, have long wanted to reduce global population for environmental reasons. Also the Amazon rain forest is now being destroyed at such a rate that it has become the main cause of global warming. CO2 is absorbed by plants and converted to oxygen, so if CO2 levels increase plant growth does also, so mitigating the problem and keeping the atmosphere stable, but human population growth has prevented this natural balance system from operating because of the resulting deforestation. While carbon taxes were never intended to fix the problem (they are  there to destroy what remains of the middle class and return their money to the elite) the real and final solution is depopulation, and vaccines are simply the most efficient, cost effective and insidious means to carry this out. What possible better solution could be devised to depopulate the Catholic Amazon region  than the Zika scare, which will deter women from even having children. Now the Pope (who is in on the whole deal) has allowed the use of contraception, calling it the lesser evil. Meanwhile  the DTap will continue to cause more birth defects which will continue to be blamed on the Zika virus. Add to this the massive increase in pesticide use, causing even more birth defects. Next will be the Zika vaccine, which will no doubt be engineered to sterilize all women and men. (Nonoxol-9 was used in the H1N1 vaccine). Expect to see a halving of the population in South America in the next 10 years.\n \t\t#81 \t\tNarad \t\t\t\t \t\t\n \t\t#92 \t\tkfunk937 \t\t\t\t \t\t\n \t\t#102 \t\tpalindrom \t\t\t\t \t\t\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very disappointed, either by you or the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-vaccines cranks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as you call them. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not in either gang, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say I would only like to know facts and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dig\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd enough. For you, my question are these: How can you explain it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s related to Zika when it has been around for so many years in so many parts of the world? Also, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about pregnant women receiving the  DTaP vaccine near the end of their pregnancy. But elsewhere, I read that they gave them at 22 weeks. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the truth? And remember, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sometimes a gap between what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being told to do and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done in reality. Can you get reliable information about when these vaccines are given to pregnant women? And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strange coincidence, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you think? That apart, I have an autoimmune disease and autoimmune diseases are on the rise (fact) and I read recently a scientific paper from an expert (Dr. Y Schoenfeld \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one paper between plenty: http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20708902) and this physician really warns against adjuvants put in vaccines. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a matter of conspiracy or else. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a matter that more and more people are living a low life quality with a chronic condition. Actually, I have time to write you right now because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on a sick leave. Please just try to give better researched facts. Maybe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a period where we have to choose between having a high probability of getting a chronic condition due to pollutants like adjuvants in vaccines (amongst other pollutants) OR being sick or very sick or even dying from an infectious disease if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the vaccines. Both issues are not nice at all, so, scientists, please keep working. But what is established and I think (not the only here) that the safety of adjuvants should be questioned. And another issue that is questionable is: they found the Zika virus in only 4 babies? And, for the babies who died, are all their mothers received the vaccine? At which week of pregnancy? And what else do these mothers and babies have in common? (food consumed etc.). I found no side convincing, but please, you should inquire more because many people would like to receive objective answers but now, I found there are a lot of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153holes of information\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in one side or the other.

At the time, I only knew the identity of one of the most important public health figures appointed by President Donald Trump, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Scott Gottleib, the man appointed to be FDA Commissioner. As I noted when his name first came up as a candidate for this position, antivaxers weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to like it. Why? One reason is because Gottlieb is the ultimate pharma shill, if such a thing exists. Another reason is that he is very pro-vaccine. This amuses me when I consider the high hopes antivaxers had for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election after his long, sordid history of antivaccine sentiments, his having met with antivaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hero\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andrew Wakefield during the presidential campaign, and his having met with another antivaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hero,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., during the transition period.\n At the time I gave my talk on Friday morning, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know whom Trump had chosen for CDC Director. If I had, my talk would have been somewhat different (although not too much). It now amuses me to consider that it now appears that Trump has chosen his CDC Director (a post that does not require Senate confirmation). She does not appear to be the sort of person who would be willing to help Trump dismantle the public health system by supporting the idea that vaccines cause autism, supporting dismantling the Vaccine Court, or calling for more bogus antivaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153research\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd designed to find nonexistent detrimental health effects due to vaccines. Her name is Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Georgia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commissioner of Public Health, a position she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s held since 2011. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not official yet, but news reports have indicated that Dr. Fitzgerald is deep in discussions to become the new CDC Director.\nTo give you an idea of the relief I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m feeling at the moment, you might recall that, when I heard that RFK Jr. was meeting with Donald Trump, I mentioned that the first thought that popped into my mind was that Trump was considering him for CDC Director or some other high profile public health position in the administration. Yet here we are, six months later, and nothing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s become of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccine commission\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that RFK Jr. claimed that Trump had offered him, while the FDA Commissioner is the ultimate pro-vaccine pharma shill. Now it appears that we will probably have a pro-vaccine, fairly boring, standard-issue CDC Director, the sort of CDC director that any Republican President might have been expected to appoint:\nNow here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the interesting thing. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite pro-vaccine. Indeed, as recently as April, she was touting not only her state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s improved vaccination rate, but urging parents to vaccinate their children:\nShe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even written opinion pieces with titles like Babies Need Their Vaccines in 2014 (before the Disneyland measles outbreak), in which she rejects antivaccine pseudoscience explicitly:\nAnd then makes an emotional appeal:\nThese are not the sort of things that someone who is antivaccine or antivaccine-sympathetic write. Nor do people who are antivaccine or antivaccine-sympathetic willingly enforce laws in which only nonmedical exemptions or religious exemptions are permitted, with a notarized state-issued form being the only accepted way of claiming a religious exemption. (Indeed, Dr. Fitzgerald was in charge when the Georgia Department of Public Health changed the rules to require a state-issued, notarized form to claim a religious exemption; presumably she had to sign off on such a major rule change\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor at least not oppose it.) Nor would an antivaccine or antivaccine-sympathetic person allow a blog that promotes vaccination, including entries promoting the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, tells parents how to catch their children up on their shots if they fall behind, and urges pregnant women to get their Tdap vaccine.\nThat sure sounds suitably pro-vaccine to me.\nOf course, basically anyone who is involved in public health, especially at a leadership level (particularly at a state leadership level) is pro-vaccine. The reason is simple, and it has nothing to do with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dogma,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as antivaxers will claim. It has to do with science and the fact that vaccines work. They are the single most effective public health intervention conceived by the human mind and made by human hands. They do not cause autism. They do not cause all the horrible autoimmune and other diseases that antivaxers claim. They save lives, lots of lives. Sooner or later, anyone in public health who is intellectually honest, regardless of ideological bent, be it liberal or conservative, comes to that conclusion. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ideological conformity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in public health officials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 belief in vaccines comes not from brainwashing, but from decades\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno, hundreds of years\u00e2\u20ac\u201dof evidence.\nInterestingly, Dr. Fitzgerald shows characteristics unusual for a Republican politician:\nI note that this action resulted in a lawsuit by Dr. Erick Walsh, the pastor fired after what he said in his sermons became known. This CNSNews.com article mentions the lawsuit, calling it a violation of religious liberty while conveniently failing to note just what the sermons said, such as:\nOK, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to give Dr. Walsh the first one. I can accept that Oprah might harbor the spirit of the Antichrist. But all the rest? Wow. In any case, Georgia ended up settling the lawsuit for $225,000. Pesonally, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think that these views are incompatible with doing a good job in public health, particularly the belief that condoms can lead to higher AIDS rates, which is just not supported by evidence, and the belief that homosexuality is a sin, but I can see how rescinding a job offer after finding out such information could give the appearance of making a job decision based on religion. Be that as it may, rare is the Republican who would have made such a decision.\nI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if Dr. Fitzgerald will be a good CDC Director or not. She seems to have the qualifications, and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find anything egregiously disqualifying in her background. She is definitely pro-vaccine. She doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have the typical conservative Republican hangups about sex, gays, and evolution. Best of all, antivaxers who have bothered to say anything hate her. For instance, Ginger Taylor, who is the Dunning-Kruger Effect personified, posted this to Facebook:\nWhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upset her? Dr. Fitzgerald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Babies Need Their Vaccines article! Hilarity! The tears of betrayal following Taylor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post are delicious. Then, a certain occasional commenter is also very, very unhappy.\nSo, am I happy with the appointment of Dr. Fitzgerald? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Relieved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is a better word to describe the feeling, although I must admit that it feels better than when Scott Gottlieb was appointed FDA Commissioner. He was basically the least bad of all the known candidates, but he is still a pharma shill who favors deregulation. Dr. Fitzgerald, in contrast, appears to be halfway decent in comparison.\nStill, I have no illusions about Trump and vaccine policy. As Dr. Paul Offit wrote a couple of weeks ago, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget takes aim at critical public health funding. If it passes, there will be less money for the CDC to do its job, less money to distribute vaccines, less money to intervene in the case of public health threats, and in general, less resources to do its critical job. Whether Dr. Fitzgerald can or would oppose such budget cuts, we have no way of knowing. Why anyone who is serious about public health would want to run the CDC under such circumstances, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know.\nStill, for a brief moment, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist feeling a bit of schadenfreude as I hear the wails of antivaxers who cry, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Betrayal!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Suckers. He conned you, too.\n","199":"\"Disneyland is an international attraction and sometimes people are coming from places where measles vaccination rates are low or they don't get the recommended two doses, and that, combined with the fact that there are a lot of pockets of non-vaccination in California and people coming from all over the U.S. created the perfect storm for a big outbreak,\" lead author Maimuna Majumder of Boston Children's Hospital and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told Reuters Health. \nThis year, the U.S. is experiencing a multi-state measles outbreak believed to have started at Disneyland this past December, as well as three other unrelated outbreaks in Illinois, Nevada, and Washington, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of March 6, 173 people from 17 states and the District of Columbia were reported to have measles, with most linked back to Disneyland. \nMeasles is a highly contagious virus that can be serious or even fatal. It starts with a fever that can last a couple of days, followed by a cough, runny nose, and pink eye. A rash develops on the face and neck then spreads to the rest of the body. In severe cases, pneumonia and encephalitis can develop. \nPeople with measles can be spreading the virus for four days before and after the rash appears, according to the CDC. \nThe virus can live for up to two hours on surfaces where an infected person coughs or sneezes. People who breathe the contaminated air or touch an infected surface and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth can become infected.\nAbout 96 to 99 percent of people in the community need to be vaccinated against measles to effectively halt its spread. Because about 7 percent of people won't get immunity from one dose of the vaccine, two doses are recommended in the U.S. \nBefore the vaccine was developed, each person with measles typically infected 11 to 18 others, Majumder and colleagues write in JAMA Pediatrics. \nBased on historical infection rates and the number of individuals infected in the current outbreak, the researchers estimate that vaccination rates in some communities might be as low as 50 percent and probably are no higher than 86 percent.\n\"Clearly, based on the number of infections we have seen so far, we can say that (the current vaccination rate) is far below the level necessary to achieve herd immunity,\" Majumder said.\nThe timing of the current outbreak, starting during school vacations for many people in the U.S., likely made measles spread more quickly, said Dr. George Rutherford, vice chair of the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, in a phone interview. \n\"There's nothing magic about Disneyland except that there are a lot of people there,\" said Rutherford, who wasn't involved in the study. \"If anything, because it's outdoors and so spread out, it might be a little harder to transmit.\"\nStill, mixing tourists from countries where vaccination rates are low, with U.S. kids whose parents don't vaccinate them for medical or personal reasons, is a likely cause of the current outbreak, he said. \n\"In this scenario, any one child with measles is going to quickly spread it to just about every other child around them who isn't already immune,\" Rutherford said. \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/1adWrco JAMA Pediatrics, online March 16, 2015.   \n","200":"The Netherlands has an extensive National Immunisation Programme to protect children against infectious diseases. The programme includes vaccination against 12 potentially fatal infectious diseases. \nThese difficult to treat and potentially fatal infectious diseases are:\nTo ensure that children receive maximum protection against these diseases, vaccinations are given in four steps. As from august 2011 all babies receive also vaccination against hepatitis B. Infants whose mothers are hepatitis B carriers also receive hepatitis B vaccination within 48 hours of birth. \n It is essential that children complete the vaccination cycle as scheduled. If your child has not been vaccinated as scheduled, you need to seek medical advice to ensure that your child receives adequate protection.\nVaccination schedule (pdf)\nThe Immunisation Programme is free of charge. While participation is not compulsory, over 95% of parents consent to having their children vaccinated. The high vaccination rate means that these serious diseases have now become a rarity. We need to keep it that way by ensuring that children are vaccinated. \n","201":"    In 2012's \"Science Left Behind\" I noted something that was perfectly obvious to anyone who was not in a progressive ideological bunker - that while both the American left and right were each anti-science about some things, only the right wing got any science media attention about it. And that was despite the fact that the left's anti-science beliefs are far more dangerous.\nGlobal warming? Okay, in a hundred years it will be a problem. Skeptics are still conserving energy and recycling just as much as ardent believers right now.\u00c2\u00a0 Evolution? So what? If some crackpot school district tries to teach that evolution is fake their parents will just have to co-sign student loans for basic biology classes in college. No one is dying if they don't believe in evolution.\nBut the left is way ahead in denying science about things that will kill people; vaccines,\u00c2\u00a0medicine and energy.\nIt's not even close. In 2012, I noted, you could go to the neighborhood around a Whole Foods and you were going to find wealthy people who voted mostly the same way (80 percent of counties with a Whole Foods chose the same candidate in 2008, an unprecedented landslide, nearly the votes Rep. Nancy Pelosi gets in her district in San Francisco) and undermined agriculture, vaccines and conventional energy.\nThough this obvious correlation was widely denied in 2012(1), it can't be denied any more. And some groups are making their hatred of farming science the rallying cry of their distrust of science across the board.\n\"March Against Monsanto\" is one example but they're almost all like this. If you are reading anything from a group that has ever gotten money from Organic Consumers Association, e.g. Moms Across America, US Right To Know, but there are about 300, or has been endorsed by Sourcewatch, your skepticism filter should go way up, because they are simply political groups who have opened up a new ideological war.\nSee how they have mastered their framing? They invent an epidemic, misuse how a common test works (2), and then propose a solution to the epidemic they created, which just happened to be what these well-funded groups are against.\nAnd note the circular self-citation of their fellow lunatic:\nThen they endorse \"Vaxxed\", the movie about a known fraud who was trying to sell a vaccine of his own, so he cherry-picked some kids and claimed the vaccines he wanted to compete with gave them autism. They have even invented authoritative-sounding groups to parrot them, like the Center for Disease Prevention and Reversal. Yes, you can prevent and reverse cancer with organic food, they believe.\nHere is the real kicker.\n\"The vaccines tested by Moms Across America and shown to contain glyphosate were the following:\n-DTAp Adacel (Sanofi Pasteur) vaccine, which had .123 parts per billion of glyphosate\n-Influenza Fluvirin (Novaris), which came in at .331 ppb of glyphosate\n-HepB Energix-B (Glaxo Smith Kiline, at .325 ppb of glyphosate\n-Pneumonoccal Vax Polyvalent Pneumovax 23 (Merk), which had .107 ppb of glyphosate\n-MMR II (Merck) vaccine, at 2.671 ppb of glyphosate.\"\nWait, this was an independent lab, right?\u00c2\u00a0No, it's the same Zen Honeycutt.\u00c2\u00a0\nThat kind of nonsense will get you on Dr. Oz, but it's not science. It is so incredibly stupid that you wouldn't be completely crazy if you suggested conspiratorially\u00c2\u00a0that maybe someone working for seed companies created this as a front to make the anti-science community look insane.\nThat was not some just some dopey unpaid intern who is the only with that remembers the password to the Twitter account. They do this stuff all of the time:\nIt's election season so a lot of otherwise people have bats in the belfry every four years, but these folks have a chronic intellectual condition. And they're dangerous in a way deniers for other issues can never be.\n'Some people think that way, but not our elites' - and then a warning label on GMOs had 52 signatures out of 55 in Congress be Democrats.\n'That denial is bipartisan' - about denying vaccines. Except a school in Marin County had 75% vaccine denial and only 20% Republicans.\u00c2\u00a0 And the top three vaccine denying states are Oregon, California and Washington - . Red states like Alabama and Mississippi have basically non-existent vaccine exemptions.\u00c2\u00a0\nI could go on but I don't want to hijack my own article with 100 articles I have already written.\n(2) In this case, the supposed independent lab refuses to answer any emails. Rather than using the herbicide detection kit on water, the only way it is valid, they just randomly used it on other compounds and wrote down the false positives as conclusive.     \n","202":"Last week, the self-proclaimed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153happiest place on earth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so happy.\nOne of the disadvantages of posting once a week is that, unless I muscle in on someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond rapidly to stories that appear early.

Another advantage is that, if I do decide to write about something from earlier in the week, I have the advantage of time to think.\nYou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve probably figured out that what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m referring to is the latest measles outbreak. Not surprisingly, it happened in the Los Angeles area. Surprisingly (or perhaps not so much), it happened at Disneyland. I say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not surprisingly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been well-publicized over the last few years that there are pockets of low vaccine uptake and high personal belief exemptions in California, complete with measles and pertussis outbreaks. This is thanks to pockets of affluent, entitled parents full of the Dunning-Kruger effect who think that they can learn as much about vaccines and autism via Google University as pediatricians and researchers who have devoted their entire professional careers to studying them. Of course, these parents are also facilitated by pediatricians who cater to their fears, the most famous of whom is Dr. Bob Sears, whose The Vaccine Book is a very popular, reasonable-sounding (to parents not aware of the antivaccine tropes within) bit of antivax lite, but there is also our old buddy Dr. Jay Gordon and a host of others.\nSo what happened at Disneyland? On January 7, the California Department of Public Health confirmed seven measles cases:\nCalifornia Department of Public Health (CDPH) has been notified of seven confirmed cases of measles in patients from five different locations within California it was reported today by Dr. Ron Chapman, CDPH director and state health officer. Two Utah resident cases have also been confirmed and three additional California residents are also suspected to have measles and are under investigation. All confirmed and suspect cases reported visiting Disneyland or Disney California Adventure Park in Orange County, California sometime between December 15 and December 20, 2014.\nBased on information from current cases, it is likely that a person infectious with measles was at one of the theme parks on these dates. People can be infectious with measles for nine days. Measles typically begins with fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and within a few days a red rash appears, usually first on the face and then spreads downward to the rest of the body. Measles is a highly infectious, airborne disease.\nBy week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end, health officials were reporting a dozen cases and expecting more to appear. Of the total cases thus far, six of the original seven cases were in unvaccinated children. Late Thursday the health department reported:\nOther sources were reporting that the total had reached 17. It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprise me if, by the time this post goes live, the figures I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m reporting here are outdated and the number of cases goes even higher still. Among these are at least two infants too young to be vaccinated. From what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been able to ascertain, most of the victims were not vaccinated. This is in contrast to other outbreaks, where the majority of those getting the measles were actually vaccinated. Antivaccinationists point to this, crying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most of the measles cases were vaccinated!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is a common antivaccine trope that sounds reasonable on the surface. Unfortunately, the measles vaccine is not 100% effective. No vaccine is. It is, however, highly effective, and, if one actually corrects for the percentage of the population that is vaccinated, one invariably finds in such outbreaks that the risk of acquiring measles is much higher in the unvaccinated. In the Disneyland outbreak, antivaccine activists can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even make that claim, as it appears that the majority of those who caught the measles were either unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated.\nI had never really thought of it before, but a theme park is an excellent incubator for an outbreak of a disease as highly infectious as the measles, particularly a theme park like Disneyland. While many theme parks tend to attract mainly from their region, theme parks like Disneyland, Disneyworld, Universal Studios Orlando, and the like, attract visitors not just from their region but from all over the world. That includes countries where there are ongoing measles outbreaks and high percentages of unvaccinated children. Add to that a location in a state where there are populations of children with low MMR uptake who visit Disneyland too, and the recipe for an outbreak is there. Over the Christmas holidays, it finally happened.\nAntivaccine pediatricians run\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve mentioned antivaccine and antivaccine-sympathetic physicians in southern California before. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising that the most prominent are running like the wind from news of the Disneyland outbreaks.\nSo great was the heat Sears felt, even from his own \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccine-averse patients,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that he felt obligated to post a follow-up. And so he did in a Facebook post entitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Orange County Measles Epidemic . . . Not (yet, anyway)!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This time, the message, also highly unprofessional, boiled down to, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, be happy, and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worrying and not happy get the vaccine. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me about it anymore.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oh, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m giving informed consent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The problem, as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve documented many times here, is that Dr. Bob and his fellow antivaccine activists don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give informed consent. They provide \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misinformed consent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that vastly inflates the risks of vaccines, attributes nonexistent risks to them (such as autism; more on that later), and minimizes the benefits of vaccines.\nThis time around, Dr. Bob appears to have learned a lesson from his previous crybaby outbursts. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managed to control his petulance a little better. On Thursday, he wrote a post entitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Measles Makes a Stop at Disneyland\u00e2\u20ac\u0153. His tone is much more measured, but underneath lies the same old attitude, in particular his downplaying the seriousness of the measles. Indeed, after acknowledging that the measles can be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153miserable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd well, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how Dr. Bob put it:\nThe bad news \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although I make light of people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tendency to panic unnecessarily, measles is no laughing matter for those who are exposed to one of these nine cases. Although most cases pass harmlessly in the long run, it is a miserable week. Severe complications are very rare, thankfully. But moderate complications, like pneumonia, can occur. It can also be more severe for infants and for pregnant moms and for immunocompromised people. Our hearts go out to any of these high-risk people who are exposed. But most complications are manageable. So, it is a worry for exposed people, I know. But for the public at large, we should just go about life as usual. For anyone exposed to those nine, you are being managed by your doctor and the health department.\nAs with all previous measles outbreaks, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason to panic. Here is some info to know:\nMake light of people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tendency to panic? A more accurate way of saying it would be that Dr. Bob heaped scorn on people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns, not just once but twice. Still, at least he acknowledges the potential complications, but even then he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist downplaying their seriousness. Pneumonia a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderate complication\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? No, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a serious complication that very frequently requires hospitalization. I suppose it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a minor victory, though, that he acknowledges that the MMR is highly effective, particularly when multiple doses have been received, but one still can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but note that Dr. Bob had to harp on the fact based on information available at the time that one of the cases was fully vaccinated.\nMeanwhile, I had an exchange with our old buddy Dr. Jay Gordon on Twitter, based on this Tweet:\nOf course, the CDC recommends that children receive their first dose of the MMR vaccine between age 12 and 18 months. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this with Dr. Jay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obfuscating? I and others asked him on Twitter:\nDr. Jay responded to me and others:\nTo which I responded:\nDr. Jay responded:\nWhich wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an answer. So I and others pestered him. Finally, he said:\nAnd:\nSo, as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve observed before, Dr. Jay won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give the MMR (or, it would seem, any vaccine) unless the parent badgers him to do it. Basically, like Dr. Bob, he washes his hands of the decision (and therefore responsibility) to vaccinate, justifying it by saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just letting the parents choose. The problem is that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153letting them choose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd based on misinformed consent, in which his copious statements expressing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concern\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about vaccines, invoking the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toxins\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gambit, and likening vaccine manufacturers to tobacco companies, as he states unequivocally that vaccine cause autism.\nNot coincidentally, after Dr. Jay was cornered on Twitter, he had a couple of new posts on his blog to justify his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concern\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for vaccinating children under three. First, he referenced the conspiracy-laden \u00e2\u20ac\u0153#CDCWhistleblower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd manufactured scandal and referred to the original paper by DeStefano et al. to justify his concern about vaccinating children under three. As I explained in three lengthy posts, neither that study, Brian Hooker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now-retracted paper, nor William Thompson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conscience tortured over fairy dust, show that the MMR vaccine causes autism when given before age 3. Dr. Jay clearly misunderstands the science.\nDr. Jay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second post is entitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MMR is not controversial because of Wakefield\u00e2\u20ac\u0153, a title that almost destroyed my keyboard, as I was foolishly taking a sip of my Sunday morning coffee when I first read it. Key gems:\nDr. Jay provides no evidence to support this and no citations, but this is of a piece with what Dr. Jay contributed to the response to the earlier measles outbreaks in southern California. His letter to his patients basically echoed Dr. Bob, saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you would like the MMR vaccine, feel free to get it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHe then concludes:\nOf course, a huge part of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153respecting parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decisions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is to give the parents accurate scientific and medical information, rather than antivaccine fear mongering. If parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pediatricians say or imply that vaccinating (or vaccinating before a certain age) is dangerous when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not, the parents will likely believe it, particularly if they are predisposed to believe bad things about vaccines. Dr. Jay, whether knowingly or unknowingly, presents a slanted case to his patients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 parents, thus making it highly unlikely that they will agree to the MMR before age 3. Of course, if Dr. Jay doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even offer it before age 3 and has to be pummeled by pro-vaccine parents into giving the vaccine earlier, then very few of his patients will get it before age 3. Parents who have to badger their child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pediatrician to vaccinate will pretty quickly realize that this is not the pediatrician for them and find another who vaccinates according to the CDC schedule. Dr. Jay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patients are thus self-selected to be vaccine-averse, and he caters to that. After all, he is well known as Evan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pediatrician (Jenny McCarthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son) and has even written the foreword of one of her books.\nUnfortunately, the problem of pediatricians who are either antivaccine, antivaccine-sympathetic, or have come to cater to vaccine-averse parents is a huge problem in California. There are, not surprisingly, pediatricians who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as famous as Dr. Bob Sears or Dr. Jay Gordon contributing to this problem. They are misleading parents and catering to the scientifically-unfounded fears of others.\nMeanwhile, VaxTruth.org posted a highly misinformation- and fallacy-laden response to the Disneyland measles outbreak, complete with one of the most intellectually-dishonest antivaccine tropes out there, the infamous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccines didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t save us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trope. It was coupled, of course, with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What, me worry?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trope in which the writer did everything she could to downplay the seriousness of the measles. It might be worth a separate post.\nNo, vaccines do not cause autism\nIronically, just before news of the Disneyland measles outbreak hit the press, a mere couple of days into 2015 there was published a study that reinforced the already copious scientific evidence that neither the MMR nor thimerosal preservative in childhood vaccines is associated with autism. The study was entitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Early exposure to the combined measles\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmumps\u00e2\u20ac\u201crubella vaccine and thimerosal-containing vaccines and risk of autism spectrum disorder\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and comes to us courtesy of Nagoya University, the Yokohama Psycho-Developmental Clinic, Fukushima University, and Juntendo University.\nI realize that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already given away the punchline, namely that this is yet another in a long line of studies that failed to find a link between vaccines (in particular the MMR) and autism or between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, but the journey to refuting antivaccine quackery with pseudoscience is more than half the pleasure. So let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a look.\nThe authors started out discussing the studies that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a link between either MMR vaccination and autism, or between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. So why did they bother to do a new study? Their rationale is actually kind of interesting:\nHowever, most studies have not considered vaccinations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 timing and the subject\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s racial heterogeneity even though genetic factors are known to be strongly involved in ASD onset. As an investigation that specified the race of the study participants, we conducted a case\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccontrol study from the Japanese population [19]. Japanese people were proven to be highly genetically homogenous according to the genotyping results of 140,387 single nucleotide polymorphisms [20]. In our previous study, there was not any convincing evidence that MMR vaccination was associated with an increased risk of ASD in Japanese people. However, the effects due to the differences in vaccinations timing and the amount of exposure to thimerosal were not accounted for in this study.\nOK, fair enough. The Japanese are a pretty genetically homogeneous people compared to most other areas where the question of whether vaccines cause autism has been studied, but, given the multiple resoundingly negative studies done before, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly unlikely that doing it again in the Japanese would provide a different result, and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong. This is a good study and is an important addition to the existing body of evidence supporting vaccine safety. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just irksome how the antivaccine movement forces scientists to reinvent the wheel again and again.\nWhat about the study itself? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case-control study, which means looking at vaccine history in autism cases versus controls after controlling for known confounders and determining if there are differences in MMR vaccination or thimerosal exposure. Basically, vaccination histories at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months from birth were investigated in ASD cases (189 samples) and controls (224 samples) matching age and sex in each case. Crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Then dosages of MMR vaccine and thimerosal were examined and investigated using a conditional multiple-regression model in order to determine if there were is any relationship between autism and overall exposure. The population providing case data came from the Yokohama Psycho-Developmental Clinic (YPDC), a clinic that only accepts patients with suspected neurodevelopmental disorders. Eligible case subjects were evaluated by the YPDC between April 1997 and March 2011 and were (1) diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and (2) had been born between April 1, 1986 and April 30, 1992.\nThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a quirk in how the cases were chosen based on the unique situation in Japan with respect to the MMR vaccine:\nMMR vaccination in Japan was conducted under specific circumstances and for only a short period of time. A combined MMR vaccination program commenced from April 1989, and only one vaccination using MMR was included in the immunization schedule. The monovalent mumps, measles, and rubella vaccines remained the optimal choice of vaccine for those who did not participate in the MMR program. However, soon after the immunization program had started, there were several cases of aseptic meningitis, which may have been caused by the mumps vaccine [31]. As a result, in April 1993, the Government ceased extensive inoculation with MMR. Therefore, children who were born from April 1984 to April 1992 could receive MMR vaccination. However, children who were born between April 1984 and March 1986 were able to receive it after the age of three. Therefore, they were excluded from the samples, because autism features always appear before the age of three. As a result, children who were born from April 1986 to April 1992 were included in the present study.\nThese days, Japan still vaccinates against measles, but, because it was the mumps component of the MMR vaccine used in Japan that caused problems over 20 years ago, the Japanese now require a combined measles-rubella (MR) vaccine instead, which is mandatory. The mumps component is voluntary but recommended. Of course, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard not to note that autism rates continued to rise in Japan even after the discontinuation of the use of MMR-combined vaccine and substitution with two separate vaccines that, together, cover the same diseases. Same as it ever was. As far as science has been able to ascertain after much trying, vaccines don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause autism; so it should not be surprising that discontinuing a vaccine demonized as the cause of autism does not result in a decline in autism prevalence.\nIn any case, the control group consisted of age- and sex-matched subjects recruited as volunteers from general schools in the Kanto area, which is the same area where YPDC patients live. Students who had previously been diagnosed with developmental disorders or problems were excluded.\nSo what were the results? I already told you, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth quoting the study:\nThe authors thus quite properly concluded that there was no convincing evidence that MMR vaccination or increasing thimerosal dose are associated with an increased risk of ASD onset. Once again, there was not a whiff of a whisper of a hint of elevated MMR or thimerosal exposure in the case group compared to controls. A key strength of this study is that parents of children receive a document referred to as the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) handbook, which is described by the authors as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly reliable data record of early development, health, and immunization, and the data are recorded by health professionals (e.g., public health nurses, obstetricians, and pediatricians).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This allowed the investigators to access detailed, accurate immunization records for cases and controls, and they excluded subjects in which entries regarding vaccines in the MCH handbook were missing or illegible. This allowed not only accurate assessment of the number of MMR vaccines each subject received, but also the total dose of thimerosal received by each subject.\nSo once again, a year starts out with researchers asking the questions:\nAgain, the answers to these questions are no and no. Vaccines do not cause autism. Again.\nIn fact, so common is this finding now that, contrary to the Disneyland measles outbreak, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a single news story about this study. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather unfortunate, because I believe that it helps to publicize such studies as yet another example of the depth and breadth of the evidence that has failed to find a link between vaccines and autism and to counter the misinformation spread by the antivaccine movement and, even worse, by pediatricians who should know better.\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not at all surprising that the first measles outbreak of 2015 (or the last measles outbreak of 2014, depending upon how you want to look at it) occurred in southern California. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the best places in the country for it. Unfortunately, the same sort of attitudes have infested my state, as evidenced by recent measles and pertussis outbreaks here. The attitudes are the same, and the results are the same. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just fortunate enough not to have an international destination that packs children of all ages from all over the world together as a place to facilitate outbreaks.\n","203":"For the past few months, an outbreak of Zika virus in the Americas has put the globe on high alert. An epidemic of infections \u00e2\u20ac\u201d some with potentially devastating side effects \u00e2\u20ac\u201d has raced through Brazil and beyond. High numbers of new cases have been emerging throughout Rio de Janeiro, site of this summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Olympic Games. Not surprisingly, there has been a race to create a Zika vaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a drug to protect still-unexposed people from this mosquito-borne virus. But in this vaccine race, researchers face a marathon, not a sprint.\nA vaccine that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe and ready to use in people could take years. That means it might not be available until long after the current epidemic is over. Last week, though, several bits of good news emerged. Scientists announced that two candidate vaccines show promise.\nJust a single shot of either protects mice from the Zika virus. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Dan Barouch and colleagues reported June 28 in Nature. This vaccine researcher works at Harvard Medical School, in Boston, Mass.\nOne vaccine comes from an inactivated form of the virus. That means it is a type that cannot cause the disease. The other vaccine uses snippets of Zika DNA. Both vaccines prevented infection by a strain of Zika that has been infecting people in Brazil. Those vaccines protected mice for at least two months, Barouch said at a news briefing on June 27.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153These findings certainly raise optimism that the development of a safe and effective vaccine against Zika virus for humans may be successful,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Tests in people, he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should proceed as quickly as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And indeed, the safety of both candidate drugs is due to be tested in people this fall.\nIn late June, a different DNA-based vaccine also got the green light for testing in people. It has been developed by two drug companies.\nMonkey study supports vaccine prospects\nAnother research team, led by Dawn Dudley at the University of Wisconsin\u00e2\u20ac\u201cMadison, infected eight rhesus macaque (REE-sus Mah-KAK) monkeys with the Zika virus. Afterward, the scientists measured virus levels in the blood and other fluids. After the infection had passed, the team infected three of the monkeys again. This time, none showed signs of Zika in blood, urine or saliva \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even 28 days later.\nA vaccine works by tricking the body into thinking it was already infected with a virus and survived. So these data from monkeys, Dudley says, suggest \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that a vaccine could be quite effective against the virus.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dudley is a molecular biologist who spoke at a news briefing on June 27. She says her data also suggest that once people get over a Zika infection they might not get another for quite a long time.\nDudley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s group reported its findings June 28 in Nature Communications.\nIn fact, Zika is a big concern for pregnant women. A growing body of data shows that an infection early in pregnancy can permanently harm a developing baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brain. The bad news, Dudley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team now finds, is that pregnancy seems to increase how long a Zika \u00c2\u00a0infection lingers in the body.\nHer team infected monkeys with Zika. Those that were not pregnant cleared the virus in about 10 days. But the germs hung on far longer in pregnant monkeys. In one case, they showed up in the blood for almost two months (57 days).\n(Story continues below graph)\nThe longer mothers have the virus, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the more severe the fetal infection might be,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said David O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Connor. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fear anyway, says this coauthor of the study. He too works at the University of Wisconsin\u00e2\u20ac\u201cMadison. To find out whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, he noted, more studies must be done.\nRisks to babies\nEarlier this year, studies linked a mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Zika infection early during pregnancy to a very serious birth defect. Called microcephaly\u00c2\u00a0(My-kroh-SEFF-uh-lee), it is a small and underdeveloped brain. Now, a Brazilian team has shown that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only risk to babies.\nLavinia Sch\u00c3\u00bcler Faccini works at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. Her team has been following 83 babies whose mothers appeared to get infected while they were pregnant. At least 92 percent of the babies showed abnormalities, they found.\nSome had vision problems. Others showed signs of brain problems, such as decreased movements or alertness. Some babies also had hand and foot deformities and an extra dimpling in their elbows and knees. Those last issues could lead to later problems when the babies get ready to walk.\nFaccini presented her group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings June 29 in San Antonio, Texas. She spoke at the annual meeting of the Teratology Society. (Teratology is the study of birth defects.)\nMeanwhile, as the Zika virus has been spreading north out of Brazil and into Colombia, more cases of microcephaly have started showing up there. Many conditions can lead to this birth defect. Some small number of cases would occur even in the absence of Zika. But between June 12 and 18, five new cases showed up in babies of moms who had been infected. So far, Colombia has reported 11 such cases of Zika-linked microcephaly.\nBefore Colombia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent report, the number of cases had hovered near the normal, low background levels, notes Yaneer Bar-Yam. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a scientist who runs the New England Complex Systems Institute in Cambridge, Mass. The recent uptick in Colombia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s microcephaly cases is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong evidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Zika is responsible, he says.\nBar-Yam and his colleagues reported their preliminary analysis June 27, on the institute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. The researchers now estimate that Colombia could see 200 more microcephaly cases in the next two to three months.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we get a whole bunch more cases,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bar-Yam says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we will definitely see that Zika is causing microcephaly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, he adds, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see those cases, then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to reevaluate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, or\u00c2\u00a0CDC\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0An agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, CDC is charged with protecting public health and safety by working to control and prevent disease, injury and disabilities.

Evidence suggests it may also cause neurological conditions such as Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome.\n","204":"Humans can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t easily protect themselves from the most dangerous species on Earth. The predator slips invisibly into homes, quietly stalks its prey and bites before a victim knows what happened. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little chance of escape.\nThe attacker is Aedes aegypti, a mosquito that has, over time, developed a taste for people. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a city dweller that hovers in undisturbed crannies and can breed in a mere capful of water. Unlike some mosquitoes, which help themselves to a good meal and fly off satisfied, Ae. aegypti is a serial biter that can work through an entire family in minutes.\nThe lingering itch isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the problem; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the saliva transferred with each bite that could be loaded with thousands of virus particles, ready to multiply in the human body with little to stop it.\nIn the early 1900s, yellow fever, named for its hallmark jaundice and temperature spikes, was the most feared consequence of an Aedes bite. Outbreaks of the viral disease flared up with regularity in major port cities, and even delayed construction of the Panama Canal. After an effective vaccine was developed in the 1930s, yellow fever subsided and an emerging threat took its place: dengue, a flulike sickness so painful that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakbone fever.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For decades, dengue has reigned as the biggest Aedes-carried menace, now estimated to infect more than 50 million people a year in the Americas and almost 400 million worldwide.\nScientists are finally on the brink of introducing promising vaccines that might help control dengue, as well as newer mosquito-borne viral risks that now dominate public attention: Zika and chikungunya.\nIn December 2013, Ae. aegypti began spreading chikungunya virus in the Caribbean; by January 2015, an estimated 1 million people were infected in the Americas (SN: 6\/13\/15, p. 16). Then another worrisome Aedes hitchhiker, the Zika virus, began cutting a wide swath through South and Central America, causing devastating birth defects (SN Online: 4\/13\/16). So far, as many as 1.4 million people in Brazil alone may have contracted Zika.\nStory continues below timeline\nTimeline: Select virus outbreaks and vaccine discoveries\nFor each of these infections, all doctors have to offer is pain relief and support. Although scientists are working on ways to remove disease-\u00adcarrying mosquitoes (SN: 4\/2\/16, p. 30), controlling growing mosquito populations is looking less like a realistic option, according to reports from a March meeting of the World Health Organization: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no evidence that any recent vector-\u00adcontrol interventions, including massive spraying of insecticides, have had any significant effect on dengue transmission.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIn the absence of effective mosquito control, vaccines provide the best hope of winning the long game. Of the vaccines under study, the most challenging \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the one currently of broadest need \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is dengue, which has proved exceptionally difficult to develop. After 70 years of effort, a dengue vaccine was approved in December for use in Mexico, the Philippines and Brazil. In April, the WHO threw its support behind the dengue shot. The vaccine has some shortcomings, but improved versions are not far behind. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very optimistic \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and I say this not just because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working on this for 16 years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Anna Durbin, a dengue vaccine researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nFor the two infections that have the public on edge, Zika and chikungunya, vaccine development may be more straightforward. This fall, human tests should start of a vaccine that enlists just two Zika virus proteins to stimulate the immune system to fight the disease. One scientist calls the approach \u00e2\u20ac\u0153simple and easy to manufacture.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nDengue dangers\nAlthough less of a headline grabber today, dengue has a long history of causing human suffering. Even Albert Sabin, famed developer of the oral polio vaccine, got involved in dengue vaccine development in the 1940s, just as the disease began its worldwide march.\nDengue is now thought to infect people in more than 100 countries (far more than Zika). Once bitten by an infected mosquito, a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s symptoms can range from nothing at all, to tender, bloody splotches under the skin, to cardiovascular collapse and death.\nVaccine development is tricky because dengue is caused by four viruses, each slightly different but all capable of causing disease on their own. While infection with one version, called a serotype, is thought to confer lifelong immunity against that serotype, a subsequent infection from a different serotype can be worse than the first. The second time around, leftover antibodies from the first episode can sometimes turn traitor, enhancing growth of the virus inside the body.\nThis one-two punch can lead to unyielding forms of dengue, including potentially fatal hemorrhagic fever. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In 95 percent of people who have very severe disease, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gotten a second infection of a different type,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Stephen Thomas of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Md. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you get infected with dengue 1, and five years later you get another dengue 1, we believe you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be protected. If you get infected with dengue 2, there are biological processes that increase your chances of severe disease.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The same goes for types 3 and 4. And the risk probably lasts a lifetime \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or until a person is infected with all four serotypes.\nScientists have attempted to develop a dengue vaccine that both simultaneously and evenly provides immunity to all four dengue viruses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most people say if a vaccine works even just a little bit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than nothing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Durbin says. In the case of dengue, however, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bad vaccine can be worse than no vaccine. You may actually predispose people to more severe disease.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAbout half a dozen dengue vaccines are in development. The first approved vaccine is Dengvaxia, made by French pharmaceutical manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur. The vaccine is built on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153backbone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the yellow fever virus vaccine, drawing on that shot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long history of success. In 25 clinical trials involving more than 40,000 participants, protection against dengue ranged from 77 percent against dengue serotype 4, to 43 percent against serotype 2, which is considered the hardest to guard against.\nThe vaccine is far from ideal. It is only for people ages 9 to 45 in dengue-hit areas. Yet small children bear a huge burden of disease. In Asia, where dengue has a long history, a study published March 24 in the New England Journal of Medicine found 10 percent of all fevers in children ages 2 to 16 were due to dengue; 19 percent of those required hospitalization.\nBut the vaccine may put some children in danger. In one clinical trial, immunization appeared to increase the risk of younger children going to the hospital for dengue the following year. Writing in the January issue of Nature Reviews Microbiology, Sanofi scientists hypothesized that the immune response from the vaccine mimicked a first infection in some of the littlest patients, predisposing them to the dangers of a second round of illness.\nOther vaccines in the pipeline, such as one by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Inviragen (now Takeda Pharmaceuticals), use a weakened form of the four live dengue viruses. In December 2015, researchers writing in the Journal of Infectious Diseases described a human test of the vaccine in Puerto Rico, Colombia, Singapore and Thailand. Among 148 volunteers ages 1 to 45, one or two doses of vaccine produced an immune response against all four types that ranged from 72 to 100 percent protection, based on the level of antibody present in the bloodstream. Even in volunteers who had been infected with dengue in the past, the vaccine did not raise safety concerns.\nA dengue vaccine developed at the National Institutes of Health and tested at Johns Hopkins and the University of Vermont is in phase III trials, the last and largest phase of experimental testing. That vaccine is also made from a weakened version of live dengue viruses and requires only one dose. In early studies, the vaccine appeared to confer only weak protection to serotype 2, which might leave a gaping hole in immune defense.\nHowever, a reassuring study was published in March in\u00c2\u00a0Science Translational Medicine. Durbin and colleagues gave 21 volunteers the NIH dengue vaccine. Six months later, they gave dengue 2 virus to the vaccinated group, as well as 20 volunteers who were not immunized. None of the vaccinated volunteers showed signs of virus in their blood, or a rash. Yet all 20 unvaccinated volunteers had positive blood tests and 80 percent had a rash. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We knew the dengue 2 component was weaker,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Durbin says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our question was, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAre we going to protect people from dengue 2?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Challenge study said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyes.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nActivating against Zika\nIn the current Zika epidemic, some scientists have theorized that dengue and Zika may be partners in crime, interacting in some way that allows the Zika virus to cross the placenta. For all its mysteries, this much is known: Before the Zika virus arrived in Brazil, it was not known to cause birth defects.\nAlthough Zika virus has caused sporadic outbreaks since the 1940s, starting in Uganda, the numbers were small, and the disease was considered minor. Zika did not become a public health emergency until it crossed the ocean in 2014. Upon reaching Brazil in 2015, the virus spread explosively. It became linked to neurological problems (SN: 4\/2\/16, p. 29) and tragedies such as microcephaly in newborns (SN: 4\/2\/16, p. 26). Before Zika, the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil was 0.5 per 10,000 births. Today, the birth defect occurs in 20 of every 10,000 births, although those estimates are inexact because of unclear reporting before Zika.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were surprised when we saw what a devastating disease it was,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Jorge Kalil, director of the Butantan Institute in S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier institution for vaccine research and development. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why do we have it? We still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nOn the vaccine front, there is reason for optimism. For one, after the infection clears, a person is thought to have lifelong protection against Zika, so lasting immunity appears possible. The Zika virus is made up of 10 proteins, but the immune system mostly responds to just two that protrude from the virus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outer surface. Scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., are making a vaccine that consists of the genes that encode these two proteins. In theory, once inside the body, a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own cells would manufacture copies of the two Zika proteins, assemble them and trigger an immune response.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making your own viruslike particle,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Julie Ledgerwood, chief of the clinical trials program at the NIH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccine research center. The particle looks like a piece of virus \u00e2\u20ac\u201d called an antigen \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that is just enough to activate the immune system but not enough to cause disease. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a straightforward technology successfully tested against West Nile virus, another mosquito-borne infection, and described in a study published in 2011 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. In that experiment, 30 volunteers received a vaccine that contained the genes for the outer coat of West Nile and their bodies began making antibodies to the virus.\nStill, even if human testing of a Zika immunization begins this fall, a vaccine could take years to work through the approval process. Kalil says that Butantan researchers in Brazil need options sooner, especially for pregnant women. Instead of asking the body to develop antibodies in response to a vaccine, the researchers are investigating whether laboratory-made antibodies that fight Zika, when given to an infected pregnant woman, might shield her baby from infection. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an unorthodox approach, he says, but his agency feels an urgency to protect infants who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait for the vaccine research to run its course.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Time is crucial,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kalil says. Already, Brazilian health authorities have confirmed more than 1,100 cases of microcephaly tied to Zika exposure. If a woman received a vaccine after she was already infected, her body would not have enough time to develop her own antibodies before the fetus is damaged, he says.\nHis institute is also developing a vaccine with whole, killed Zika virus. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very basic, and we know it is safe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, because the virus is dead. The killed virus may eventually be combined with a dengue vaccine.\nReady for chikungunya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resurgence\nAs with Zika, experts believe one infection from chikungunya leaves lasting protection \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a key reason that the epidemic in the Americas has largely subsided for now.\nChikungunya virus was first identified in the 1950s on the Makonde Plateau in Africa. Its name is roughly translated as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that which bends up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a reference to the excruciating joint pain that can accompany infection. In December 2013, for reasons still not known, it leaped to another hemisphere, quickly spreading to South and Central America, lapping at the U.S. border. While rarely fatal, the disease can cause sore joints and arthritis long after a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial recovery.\nMore than 15 different chikungunya vaccines are in various stages of development, employing almost every known approach to vaccine innovation, according to researchers from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston writing in June in the journal Vaccine. The field has suffered some disappointments. The first vaccine to be tested in people used a weakened live version of the virus. Its development was halted in the early 2000s. Some early volunteers experienced joint pain, and studies raised concerns that the virus could gain strength \u00e2\u20ac\u201d perhaps easier for chikungunya than other viruses because it can do so with just a few mutations.\nThe majority of chikungunya vaccines involve the use of weakened or killed virus. Only two have been tested in humans, and just one of those is currently in clinical trials.\nThe human trial in progress, led by NIH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ledgerwood, tests a vaccine similar to the Zika vaccine. Her team is injecting just a few genes from the chikungunya virus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outer coat, allowing the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own cells to make a piece of virus. The tricky part of the technology, she says, is to make sure that the three proteins coded by the viral genes get assembled in the correct order so the immune system mistakes them for an actual virus.\nAmong 25 people who received three doses of the vaccine, two doses triggered a vigorous immune response, the researchers reported in The Lancet in 2014. No one developed serious side effects. The NIH team is recruiting 400 volunteers in the Caribbean \u00e2\u20ac\u201d half will receive the vaccine and be compared with their unvaccinated neighbors.\nScott Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, is heading a team investigating a newer version of a live, weakened virus. Tests indicate that the virus used in this vaccine is more genetically stable than many strains, and unlikely to strengthen over time. Last year, in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, Weaver and colleagues reported that in animal tests, the virus passed through five different generations of mice and did not show signs of mutating into a more virulent form. Weaver hopes the results help clear the way for studies in people.\nThe current chikungunya epidemic has been waning, causing just over 100,000 suspected cases this year in the Caribbean and Latin America. With little disease to protect against, a vaccine trial is hard to conduct. But most predict that the lull is only temporary.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chikungunya is not going away,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Weaver says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are on the back end of the current epidemic, but there will be another one coming, and we hope to have a vaccine ready in time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nExtra hurdles\nIf the epidemics aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t brought under control, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fear that the viruses could migrate from Ae. aegypti into its cousin Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, which is more widespread in the cooler climates of the United States (SN Online: 5\/16\/16; SN: 6\/29\/13, p. 26). Asian tiger mosquitoes have already shown they are capable of spreading Zika, as they did in a 2007 outbreak in Gabon. They also spread chikungunya in an outbreak on the island of R\u00c3\u00a9union in 2005.\nIf there is one lesson from yellow fever, it is that science is not the only hurdle. Vaccines must overcome tests of logistics, politics and economics. After generations of control, yellow fever emerged in Angola and other parts of Africa in January and is spreading. As of June 1, Angola had 2,893 suspected cases and 325 people had died. Yellow fever vaccine is in short supply, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear how soon manufacturers can ramp up production.\nWriting in JAMA on May 9, two professors from Georgetown University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law asked the WHO to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153urgently convene an emergency committee to mobilize funds, coordinate an international response and spearhead a surge in [yellow fever] vaccine production.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nWhile not declaring the yellow fever escalation an emergency, Margaret Chan, WHO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director-general, told the United Nations general assembly on May 23 that the spread of Zika, dengue and chikungunya are the price being paid for policies that dropped the ball on mosquito and disease control.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The lesson from yellow fever is especially brutal,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world failed to use an excellent preventive tool to its full strategic advantage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After all, a vaccine is no good if the people in need don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive it.\nThis story appears in the June 25, 2016, Science News with the headline, \"Swat that virus: Researchers aim to take the sting out of mosquito-carried diseases.\"\n","205":"The world greets newborn babies by bombarding them with everything from dust to disease-causing microbes. Babies can deftly parry exposures to certain harmful substances, thanks to antibodies passed onto them in the womb. But this kind of inherited immunity is short-lived, so a child must develop her own immune system response to combat life-threatening diseases. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where vaccines\u00c2\u00a0come into the picture.\n \tBy age two, most children will receive almost 30 shots designed to boost a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural defenses against disease. Yet at the same time, parents who take their children for those recommended vaccinations might be inundated with Web site and celebrity-espoused rumors making false claims that shots are not necessary or cause autism. At best, navigating this landscape can be confusing. But when weighing the risks of encountering life-threatening disease against the benefits of receiving a vaccine there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no contest. The vast majority of children do not experience anything worse than short-lived redness or itching at the spot of the shot. So why is there so much misinformation?\n \tOne reason is developmental timing. Children receive a bevy of vaccines before age two, roughly overlapping with when children with autism spectrum disorder may noticeably develop symptoms like the inability to gain new skills. That coincidence has helped the autism\u00e2\u20ac\u201cvaccine connection myth persist. And what may have once been passed around by neighborhood gossip is now amplified worldwide by Web sites and social media. But the science simply does not bear out such fears. In August 2011 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report that examined eight childhood vaccines and potential side effects. It found that vaccines are largely safe and that side effects are usually very rare and minor.\n \tSide effects\n \tThe overwhelming medical evidence finds that most vaccine side effects among newborns and young children are mild\u00e2\u20ac\u201dswelling, redness and a small, hard lump at the site of the injection\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand typically pass within a couple days. A far less common but serious vaccine side effect, occurring in fewer than one in a million cases, is an immediate\u00c2\u00a0allergic reaction that can be treated with common medications to ease itching or swelling or, in more serious cases, by administering epinephrine. Rarely, with certain vaccinations there can be other problems. After receiving the first shot of the measles\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmumps\u00e2\u20ac\u201crubella (MMR) vaccination, for example, a child has a roughly one in 3,000 chance of developing a fever that leads to a seizure. Such seizures do not lead to any permanent neurological damage. Moreover, they also occur more generally when kids develop high fevers\u00e2\u20ac\u201dafflicting up to 5 percent of young children. That does not mean it is not upsetting to see. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to watch your child seize,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Paul Offit, a pediatrics professor at The Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital of Philadelphia. His own daughter had a seizure after receiving the combo vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis but he says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to remember that this type of seizure does not cause long-term consequences. And scientific evidence finds that MMR-related seizures are actually less frequent than ones that occur as a direct result of the measles infection itself.\n \tWhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a vaccine?\n \tWhen a person encounters a pathogen, there is no way to predict whether it will induce a mild or severe form of disease nor how the body will react. But vaccines are selected to contain a weakened or dead form of the disease-causing germ that can spark an immune response. Exposure will thus allow the body to build up immunity in a controlled way. The immune system reaction stops this compromised foreign invader in its tracks at the site of injection. And the key to vaccine success is that, afterward, the immune system starts to create fast-response infection fighters called memory cells that will circulate throughout the body and be able to recognize (and fend off) that pathogen in the future.\n \tThese weak or killed stimulants, called antigens, are grown in a lab setting, isolated and then mixed with preservatives, stabilizers and a substance like aluminum that will trigger the immune system to vigorously respond to the vaccine. The process saves lives: Among children born in the past two decades, vaccinations will prevent more than 20 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates.\n \tWhy do vaccines cause any side effects?\n \tLike any medicine, immunizations can lead to a negative reaction. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising because every individual is different. Genetic variations, immune deficiencies and environmental exposures all contribute to how a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body reacts to inoculations against disease.\n \tBut are so many shots dangerous?\n \tExpert medical bodies including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) urge parents to vaccinate their kids against 16 diseases. The CDC schedule for childhood vaccinations, which relies on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and is endorsed by APP, is drawn up based on data detailing when the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system will mount the best response to the vaccine and, secondly, balanced against the need to protect kids at the earliest age possible. There is no scientific data suggesting a medical benefit from spacing out vaccines over a longer period than the official recommendations.\n \tVaccines are also regularly evaluated for safety. Before they are added to the recommended regimen they must undergo testing to make sure they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interfere with one another. There have also been multiple studies that evaluated vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cumulative effects.\n \tStill, pediatricians face continual pressure from some worried parents who sometimes want to spread out the recommended inoculation schedule or postpone certain vaccinations, decisions that can prolong the period of vulnerability to disease. For example, a new nationally representative study published in the April 2015 Pediatrics found that in an average month 93 percent of surveyed doctors received at least one request from parents to spread out shots. And it happened relatively frequently: more than a fifth of the 534 surveyed physicians reported that 10 percent of parents made such requests. Parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wishes were then often honored\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe majority of the surveyed clinicians ultimately agreed to do so, at least some of the time.\n \tYet fears about a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body not being able to handle potent vaccines are misguided. Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune systems respond to several hundred foreign substances that trigger an immune response every day. In contrast, the complete schedule of recommended childhood vaccinations includes under 200 antigens.\n \tDo vaccines cause autism?\n \tSome concerns about vaccines stem from discredited work that suggested they lead to autism. (The findings were subsequently retracted and the physician who did that small study was barred from practicing medicine due to ethical lapses.) More than a dozen studies have added to the body of evidence that this link does not exist. Expert groups including the IOM and the AAP agree that vaccines do not contribute to children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autism rates. The vaccine additive thimerosal, a preservative that contains a form of mercury (organomercurcial, not methylmercury) also does not cause autism. It is now only included in pediatric vaccines in trace amounts (or not at all) but there is no medical evidence that it causes autism in patients.\n \tCan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t children thrive without vaccines?\n \tWe live in a crowded, fast-moving world, and disease travels easily. The data is clear: Failure to immunize a child comes with a much more formidable risk\u00e2\u20ac\u201dleaving children vulnerable to contracting a potentially debilitating or lethal illness. Some children are too sick or too young to receive inoculations, so they remain at risk. If those children or other unvaccinated kids come into contact with someone else who was not protected against certain microbes, that can set off a wave of disease like the measles outbreak currently spreading in the U.S. Maladies that have become uncommon, such as polio and measles, can also quickly reappear if we stop vaccinating against them, particularly when they are unintentionally imported across geographic borders. The measles outbreak currently rippling through the U.S., for example, has genetic markers that suggest it came from an overseas traveler. Protecting kids actually helps protect everyone.\n","206":"Last year 10 children died in California in the worst whooping cough outbreak to sweep the state since 1947. In the first six months of 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 10 measles outbreaks\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe largest of which (21 cases) occurred in a Minnesota county, where many children were unvaccinated because of parental concerns about the safety of the standard MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella. At least seven infants in the county who were too young to receive the MMR vaccine were infected.\nThese troubling statistics show that the failure to vaccinate children endangers both the health of children themselves as well as others who would not be exposed to preventable illness if the community as a whole were better protected. Equally troubling, the number of deliberately unvaccinated children has grown large enough that it may be fueling more severe outbreaks. In a recent survey of more than 1,500 parents, one quarter held the mistaken belief that vaccines can cause autism in healthy children, and more than one in 10 had refused at least one recommended vaccine.\nThis sad state of affairs exists because parents have been persistently and insidiously misled by information in the press and on the Internet and because the health care system has not effectively communicated the counterarguments, which are powerful. Physicians and other health experts can no longer just assume that parents will readily agree to childhood inoculations and leave any discussion about the potential risks and benefits to the last minute. They need to be more proactive, provide better information and engage parents much earlier than is usually the case.\nPeril of Business as Usual\n Right now pediatricians typically bring up the need for vaccines during the well-baby checkup held about two months after birth. That visit has a jam-packed agenda. In the usual 20 minutes allotted for the appointment, the physician must learn the answers to many questions, of which the following are but a sample: How many times is the baby waking to feed at night? Is the child feeding well? Where do measurements of height, weight and head circumference fall on a standard growth chart? Do the parents know how and when to introduce solid food and how to safely lay the child down to sleep? Are various reflexes good? Can the sounds of a heart murmur be heard through the stethoscope? Are the hip joints fitting properly in their sockets, or are they dislocated?\nGenerally in the final seconds of the visit, assuming all has gone well to this point, the doctor mentions the required schedule for six recommended inoculations: the first DTaP shot (for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, also known as whooping cough), the polio shot, a second hepatitis B shot (the first having been given in the first few days after birth), the pneumococcal conjugate shot (for bacterial pneumonia and meningitis), the HiB shot (for another type of meningitis) and finally the rotavirus vaccine (to prevent a severe diarrheal infection). This is the point in the visit at which more and more pediatricians report a disheartening turn of events: although most parents agree to the inoculations without hesitation, a growing number say they would like to delay or even refuse some or all of the vaccinations for their infants.\u00c2\u00a0\nA proper conversation that respects the reluctant parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns, answers their questions and reassures them that the inoculations are indeed necessary\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat countless studies by hundreds of researchers over many decades have shown that vaccinations save millions of lives\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwill likely take at least another 20 minutes. Meanwhile, though, other families sit in the waiting room, itching for their own well-baby checkups to start.\nThis all too common scene should never happen. Having this discussion at the two-month well-baby visit is too late. By then, parents may have read about any issues on the Web or chatted with other moms and dads in the park. Discussion with medical professionals should begin long before, usually during, or even prior to, the pregnancy. The evidence summarized below should form the basis for these exchanges.\n [break] \nFears and Facts\n Although parents give many reasons for not wanting to vaccinate their children, we have noticed at least three recurring themes. Some do not believe their children are at risk for diseases such as polio, measles and tetanus, which are now rarely seen in the U.S. Others do not believe that certain vaccine-preventable diseases, such as chicken pox and measles, are particularly serious. And many worry about the safety of vaccines. The concerns may be about immediate, well-defined side effects such as fever or may take the form of anxiety that vaccines might harm the immune system or cause chronic diseases years later. Each of these concerns can be met with a careful review of the evidence.\nTogether we have conducted a series of studies to better quantify the risks of not vaccinating\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinformation that speaks to the mistaken belief that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s children are unlikely to come down with whooping cough, measles or the like if they skip their inoculations. Our investigations looked at hundreds of thousands of children in Colorado and compared the risk of various vaccine-preventable diseases in children whose parents had refused or delayed vaccines, compared with children whose parents had had them vaccinated. We found that unvaccinated children were roughly 23 times more likely to develop whooping cough, nine times more likely to be infected with chicken pox, and 6.5 times more likely to be hospitalized with pneumonia or pneumococcal disease than vaccinated children from the same communities. Clearly, the parental decision to withhold vaccination places youngsters at greatly increased risk for potentially serious infectious diseases. These results also show the flaws in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free rider\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd argument, which erroneously suggests that an unvaccinated child can avoid any real or perceived risks of inoculation because enough other children will have been vaccinated to protect the untreated child.\nDepending on fate to soften the blow from an infection is also more dangerous than most people realize. One out of every 20 previously healthy children who get the measles will come down with pneumonia. One out of 1,000 will suffer an inflammation of the brain that can lead to convulsions and mental retardation, and one to two out of 1,000 will die. Similarly, chicken pox can lead to severe infections of the skin, swelling of the brain, and pneumonia. Even when no complications arise, chicken pox is painful and triggers high fevers and itchy rashes. Vaccinated children who develop chicken pox (no vaccine is perfectly effective all the time) usually suffer much milder symptoms.\nEven when parents appreciate the peril of not vaccinating, they want to know that vaccines are safe. Because vaccines are given to huge numbers of people, including healthy infants, they are held to a much higher safety standard than medications used for people who are already sick. Nothing in medicine is 100 percent safe, however, and the absolute safety of vaccines cannot be proved. Safety can be inferred, though, by the relative absence of serious side effects in multiple studies.\nStudying the safety of vaccines is a complicated, labor-intensive process. Fortunately, the U.S. has a sophisticated system, a federally funded program that does not receive any money from vaccine manufacturers. This system can both test specific hypotheses and perform general monitoring of the safety of newly licensed vaccines. As a new theory arises, it can be rigorously tested.\nPerhaps the biggest boost to the antivaccine movement came in 1998, when, in a paper in the Lancet, Andrew J. Wakefield and 12 colleagues proposed that the measles vaccine could cause autism in susceptible children. In the years since, more than a dozen studies have convincingly shown that vaccines do not cause autism. In fact, it is rare in science that published scientific findings have been so thoroughly, and publicly, disproved. The Lancet retracted the Wakefield article in early 2010. Most of the co-authors no longer vouch for the study findings. And Wakefield himself was accused of falsifying the data and lost his medical license.\n [break] \nDespite the complete dismantling of Wakefield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccines-cause-autism hypothesis, public skepticism about vaccination has only increased as new speculative theories have been put forward. Maybe, some contend, vaccine preservatives cause long-term problems. Or maybe the growing number of vaccines all assaulting the immature immune system at once causes complications. Or perhaps trouble can arise from a toxic combination of vaccines with air pollution, chemical and metal contamination of the environment, and the increasing stress of modern life.\nThat this cycle\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddebunked links followed by ever grander speculation\u00e2\u20ac\u201dkeeps repeating itself is a clear indication that the scientific community is more reactive than proactive when engaging the public about vaccine safety. Investigating narrow, specific theories about vaccines does not seem to provide adequate reassurance to parents with broad and vague worries about vaccines.\nSo where does this leave the conversation between health professionals and parents? A good place for talks to begin would be in a prenatal class devoted to vaccines or through Web chats with physicians and vaccine researchers. Web interactions, in particular, might encourage prospective parents to openly air their concerns and raise sensitive questions they may not feel comfortable asking in a face-to-face visit with their child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own pediatrician. Education campaigns should also be carried out. But many moms and dads will still need a forum where they can find accurate information, voice their worries, and engage in a full discussion about the benefits and risk of vaccines. And many will still want their infant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doctor to look them in the eyes and say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is one of the best things you can do for your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe key facts parents need to know, though, are that vaccines prevent potentially fatal diseases, that vaccines have a high degree of safety, and that their safety is constantly evaluated and reevaluated in a system operating independently from the pharmaceutical companies that make vaccines. Unless this message gets spread widely and well, too many doctors and parents are going to find themselves in emergency rooms and isolation wards, watching children suffer with the devastating effects of measles, whooping cough or some other readily preventable infectious disease.\u00e2\u20ac\u201a\n","207":"Minnesota health officials are ramping up vaccination  recommendations for children after the state reported  48 recent confirmed cases of measles in three counties, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more cases likely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The scary outbreak has mostly affected unvaccinated Somali-American children, according to data  released by the state's department of health on Monday. This is the largest measles outbreak for the state in recent history\u00e2\u20ac\u201donline data  reveals that the state has had 56 reported cases of the infectious disease over the last 20 years, not including the latest outbreak. And experts say anti-vaccine sentiments are to blame.\n\"I want to be very clear that this outbreak has nothing to do with being Somali. It's just the sheer fact of being unvaccinated,\" Kristen Ehresmann, director of the infectious disease epidemiology, prevention and control division at the Minnesota Department of Health, told CNN , adding that the outbreak is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153completely unnecessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd given that there is a vaccine that can prevent measles.\nAccording to CNN, vaccine skepticism started in the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Somali-American community in 2008 after parents noticed a disproportionate number  of Somali children receiving special education services for autism. Autism and vaccines are not linked, according to the wealth of research on the subject, but there was understandably still concern about what could be contributing to Somali-American children's autism. \"At that point, the anti-vaccine groups just really started targeting the community,\" Ehresmann said. In response, vaccination rates of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine dropped. British researcher Andrew Wakefield, who published a paper linking vaccines to autism that was later found to be fraudulent and was retracted, also visited the community several times.\nDespite absolutely no scientific evidence, the anti-vaccination community continues to insist that there's a link between vaccines and autism.\nMany major health organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Academy of Medicine, and the World Health Organization, have repeatedly stated that there is no connection between vaccinations and autism  or other neurological conditions. Many studies have also backed up those statements.\nSkeptics are specifically wary of thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative used in some vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extensive information on thimerosal and vaccines on its Web site , repeatedly stating that the preservative poses no harm to humans\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand offering scientific research to back up those statements.\nThimerosal was removed as an ingredient from many vaccines in the late \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc90s as a precaution but, after research found it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t linked with health problems, it was added to some flu vaccines, the CDC  says. Federico Laham, M.D., medical director for pediatric infectious diseases at Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital, tells SELF that signs of autism tend to surface earlier in life, which is also around the time that children receive vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand that may help explain the connection. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People look for culprits for kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 autism, but we can say that vaccination is not responsible for it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says.\nThe CDC  recommends that children receive two doses of the MMR vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe first dose at age 12 to 15 months and the second when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re four through six years old. But unfounded vaccination fears are causing some parents to space out vaccines or avoid the vaccine altogether\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand experts say that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying.\nThe MMR vaccine is an essential part of keeping children safe and healthy.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Foregoing the vaccine] is dangerous because this is a serious infection of children,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells SELF. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People have forgotten that before we had vaccines in the U.S., each year 400 to 500 children died of measles and its complications.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nWhen someone contracts measles, they typically develop a cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash of tiny red spots that starts at the head and spreads to the rest of the body, the CDC says. But Schaffner points out that children often get complications of measles, including pneumonia and meningitis , which can be deadly. Laham agrees, noting that he recently treated a child who went deaf from pneumococcal meningitis that could have been prevented from following the MMR vaccination schedule. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are unintended consequences of not vaccinating children,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says.\nMeasles  is also easily spread among people who are unvaccinated, Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a board-certified infectious disease physician and affiliated scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells SELF. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It can remain suspended in particles in the air\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s literally spread through the air,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Someone with measles can leave a room but those particles remain and can be infectious.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ensuring that everyone who can get vaccinated does so also helps protect vulnerable populations (like young children or those with compromised immune systems) from contracting a deadly disease. This is what's known as \"herd immunity,\" a phenomenon that occurs when people in a community are protected against an illness because the majority of them are vaccinated against it.\nHence why Adalja calls the MMR vaccine a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crucial component\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of controlling measles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so highly contagious\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we want vaccination rates to be as close to 100 percent as possible,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. However, Adalja points out that there are pockets in the U.S. where vaccination rates have fallen to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dangerously low levels,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd including the Somali-American population in Minnesota, which has vaccination rates of only about 42 percent, according to the Minnesota Department of Health.\nThe Pan American Health Organization  announced in 2016 that endemic measles, i.e., cases caused by local strains instead of imported ones, has been banished from the U.S. and the rest of the Americas. However, people can still contract measles from an infected traveler if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unvaccinated\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand then it can spark an outbreak. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If a measles case from abroad gets in, it can work its way through an unvaccinated community quickly because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so highly contagious,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Schaffner.\nIf you have concerns about vaccinating your children, experts urge you to talk to your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pediatrician about your fears. It can also be helpful to read information from reputable sources, like the CDC, American Academy of Pediatrics, and FDA. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have to be informed and make choices on behalf of your kids who are too young to make them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Laham says.\nAdalja calls outbreaks like the one in Minnesota \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very ominous,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd noting that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harkening back to a more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153primitive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd time in medicine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The anti-vaccination movement is pulling people back to an era of civilization when infectious diseases were the norm and many kids didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it out of childhood,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The choice is clear here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe thing is, convincing skeptical parents to vaccinate their children is often incredibly difficult.\nIt's not enough to have facts on your side, and it's not enough to argue about those facts until you think your point must have gotten across. All that will do is make the person on the other side even more committed to their beliefs\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor committed to ignoring everything you're saying.\nInstead, bringing more parents around to the safety and efficacy of vaccination mainly comes down to empathy and finding common ground. An October 2015 study from Stanford University , for example, found that conservatives and liberals who worked to appeal to the opposite group's moral values were more successful at swaying opinions. This is actually very easy to do with parenting, because every parent just wants to keep their children happy and healthy.\nTelling wary and fearful parents they're wrong because vaccines are safe, effective, and not linked to autism doesn't make them inclined to change their minds, according to a February 2015 study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America . But when skeptical parents learned about how dangerous diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella can be and that a vaccine can prevent these diseases, saw photos of children suffering from these illnesses, and heard from a mom whose child almost died due to measles, they were more inclined to support vaccination.\nSo, when we talk about a health crisis like the one brewing in Minnesota, let's keep this in mind: Facts and anger aren't going to change minds. Empathy and understanding in an effort to reach the common goal of keeping children safe might.\nRelated:\nWatch: 11 Signs of Stress\n","208":"This story was updated Nov. 27, 2016 to add results of new survey of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated children\n\u00c2\u00a0[The following news analysis and commentary was first published Dec. 31, 2015]\nA new study this week found no link between vaccines and autism. It instantly made headlines on TV news and popular media everywhere. Many billed it as the final word, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153once again,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd disproving the notion that vaccines could have anything to do with autism.\nWhat you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t learn on the news was that the study was from a consulting firm that lists major vaccine makers among its clients: The Lewin Group.\nThat potential conflict of interest was not disclosed in the paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine; the study authors simply declare \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Lewin Group operates with editorial independence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n(As an aside, according to OpenSecrets.org, The Lewin Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, UnitedHealth Group, is a key government partner in Obamacare. Its subsidiary QSSI was given the contract to build the federal government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HealthCare.gov website. One of its top executives and his family are top Obama donors.)\nConflicts of interest alone do not invalidate a study. But they serve as\u00c2\u00a0important context in the relentless effort by pharmaceutical interests and their government partners to discredit the many scientists and studies that have found possible vaccine-autism links.\nMany Studies Suggest Possible Vaccine-Autism Links\nWhen the popular press, bloggers and medical pundits uncritically promote a study like The Lewin Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, it must confound researchers like Lucija Tomljenovic, Catherine DeSoto, Robert Hitlan, Christopher Shaw, Helen Ratajczak, Boyd Haley, Carolyn Gallagher, Melody Goodman, M.I. Kawashti, O.R. Amin, N.G. Rowehy, T. Minami, Laura Hewitson, Brian Lopresti, Carol Stott, Scott Mason, Jaime Tomko, Bernard Rimland, Woody McGinnis, K. Shandley and D.W. Austin.\nThey are just a few of the many scientists whose peer-reviewed, published works have found possible links between vaccines and autism. But unlike The Lewin Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s study, their research has not been endorsed and promoted by the government and, therefore, has not been widely reported in the media. In fact, news reports, blogs and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153medical experts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd routinely claim no such studies exist.\nTo be clear: no study to date conclusively proves or disproves a causal link between vaccines and autism and\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddespite the misreporting\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnone has claimed to do so. Each typically finds either (a) no association or (b) a possible association on a narrow vaccine-autism question. Taken as a whole, the research on both sides serves as a body of evidence.\nThe Astroturf Propaganda Campaign\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theoretically possible that all of the studies supporting a possible link between vaccines and autism are wrong. And, if the propagandists are to be believed, each of the researchers is an incompetent crank, quack, nut or fraud (and, of course, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for daring to dabble in research that attempts to solve the autism puzzle and leads to vaccine safety issues). The scientists and their research are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153controversial,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd simply because the propagandists declare them to be.\nThe disparaged scientists include well-published neurologists, pharmacists, epidemiologists, immunologists, PhD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, chemists and microbiologists from places like Boston Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital, Horizon Molecular Medicine at Georgia State University, University of British Columbia, City College of New York, Columbia University, Stony Brook University Medical Center, University of Northern Iowa, University of Michigan, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Arkansas Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital Research Institute, Al Azhar University of Cairo, Kinki University in Japan, the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Swinburne University of Technology in Australia, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Poland, Department of Child Health Care, Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital of Fudan University in China, Utah State University and many more.\nTheir work is, at best, ignored by the media; at worst, viciously attacked by the predictable flock of self-appointed expert \u00e2\u20ac\u0153science\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bloggers who often title their blogs with the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153science\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153skeptics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to confer an air of legitimacy.\nThis astroturf movement, in my opinion, includes but is not limited to: LeftBrainRightBrain, ScienceBlogs, NeuroSkeptic, ScienceBasedMedicine, LizDitz, ScienceBasedMedicine, CrooksandLiars, RespectfulInsolence, HealthNewsReview, SkepticalRaptor, Skepticblog, Skeptics.com, Wired, BrianDeer, SethMnookin, Orac, Every Child by Two, the vaccine industry supported American Academy of Pediatrics, and the government\/corporate funded American Council on Science and Health (once called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Voodoo Science, Twisted Consumerism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the watchdog Center for Science in the Public Interest).\nThis circle operates with the moral support of the vaccine industry and its government partners, citing one another\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flawed critiques as supposed proof that each study has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153debunked,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd though the studies continue to appear in peer-reviewed, published journals and in the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own National Institutes of Health library.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Weak,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too small,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153haphazard,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not replicated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153junk science,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flawed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unrelated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd declare the propagandists, without exception. Just as attackers spent years challenging any study that linked tobacco to lung cancer.\nThey know that reporters who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do their homework will conduct an Internet search, run across the blogs with science-y sounding names, and uncritically accept their word as if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fact and prevailing thought.\nCDC claims \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no link\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between vaccines and autism\nA Small Sampling\nMany of the studies have common themes regarding a subset of susceptible children with immunity issues who, when faced with various vaccine challenges, end up with brain damage described as autism.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Permanent brain damage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is an acknowledged, rare side effect of vaccines; there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no dispute in that arena. The question is whether the specific form of autism brain injury after vaccination is in any way related to vaccination.\nSo what are a few of these published studies supporting a possible link between vaccines and autism?\nAs far back as 1998, a serology study by the College of Pharmacy at University of Michigan supported the hypothesis that an autoimmune response from the live measles virus in MMR vaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may play a causal role in autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0(Nothing to see here, say the critics, that study is old.)\nIn 2002, a Utah State University study found that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an inappropriate antibody response to MMR [vaccine], specifically the measles component thereof, might be related to pathogenesis of autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Flawed and non-replicable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd insist the propagandists.)\nAlso in 2002, the Autism Research Institute in San Diego looked at a combination of vaccine factors. Scientists found the mercury preservative thimerosal used in some vaccines (such as flu shots) could depress a baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immunity. That could make him susceptible to chronic measles infection of the gut when he gets MMR vaccine, which contains live measles virus. (The bloggers say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old study, and that other studies contradict it.)\nIn 2006, a team of microbiologists in Cairo, Egypt concluded, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deficient immune response to measles, mumps and rubella vaccine antigens might be associated with autism, as a leading cause or a resulting event.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nA 2007 study found statistically significant evidence suggesting that boys who got the triple series Hepatitis B vaccine when it contained thimerosal were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more susceptible to developmental disability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than unvaccinated boys.\nSimilarly, a 5-year study of 79,000 children by the same institution found boys given Hepatitis B vaccine at birth had a three times increased risk for autism than boys vaccinated later or not at all. Nonwhite boys were at greatest risk. (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Weak study,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd say the critics.)\nA 2009 study in The Journal of Child Neurology found a major flaw in a widely-cited study that claimed no link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism. Their analysis found that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the original p value was in error and that a significant relation does exist between the blood levels of mercury and diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n (Critics: the study is not to be believed.) \nFDA list of thimerosal-containing vaccines \nA 2010 rat study by the Polish Academy of Sciences suggested \u00e2\u20ac\u0153likely involvement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of thimerosal in vaccines (such as flu shots) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (The critics dismiss rat studies.)\nIn 2010, a pilot study in Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis found that infant monkeys given the 1990\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommended pediatric vaccine regimen showed important brain changes warranting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153additional research into the potential impact of an interaction between the MMR and thimerosal-containing vaccines on brain structure and function.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nA study from Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kinki University in 2010 supported \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the possible biological plausibility for how low-dose exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines may be associated with autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nA 2011 study from Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Swinburne University supported the hypothesis that sensitivity to mercury, such as thimerosal in flu shots, may be a genetic risk factor for autism. (Critics call the study \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strange\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153logical hurdles.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd)\nA Journal of Immunotoxicology review in 2011 by a former pharmaceutical company senior scientist concluded autism could result from more than one cause including encephalitis (brain damage) following vaccination. (Critics say she reviewed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153debunked and fringe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd science.)\nIn 2011, City University of New York correlated autism prevalence with increased childhood vaccine uptake. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although mercury has been removed from many vaccines, other culprits may link vaccines to autism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the study\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead author. (To critics, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153junk science.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd)\nA University of British Columbia study in 2011 that found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the correlation between Aluminum [an adjuvant] in vaccines and [autism] may be causal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (More \u00e2\u20ac\u0153junk science,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd say the propagandists.)\nA 2011 rat study out of Warsaw, Poland found thimerosal in vaccines given at a young age could contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. (Proves nothing, say critics.)\nA Chinese study in 2012 suggested that febrile seizures (an acknowledged side effect of some vaccines) and family history of neuropsychiatric disorders correlate with autistic regression.\nA 2012 study from the Neurochemistry Research Marie Curie Chairs Program in Poland found that newborn exposure to vaccines with thimerosal (such as flu shots) might cause glutamate-related brain injuries.\nIn 2013, neurosurgeons at the Methodist Neurological Institute found that children with mild mitochondrial defect may be highly susceptible to toxins like the vaccine preservative thimerosal found in vaccines such as flu shots. (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Too small\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a study, say the critics.)\nIn 2016, Frontiers published a survey of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated children. The vaccinated had a higher rate of allergies and NDD (neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism) than the unvaccinated. Vaccination, but not preterm birth, remained significantly associated with NDD after controlling for other factors. However, preterm birth combined with vaccination was associated with an apparent synergistic increase in the odds of NDD.\nThen, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 2004 Columbia University study presented at the Institute of Medicine. It found that mice predisposed for genetic autoimmune disorder developed autistic-like behavior after receiving mercury-containing vaccines. (Critics say that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not proof, and the work was not replicable.)\nThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dr. William Thompson, the current CDC senior scientist who has come forward with an extraordinary statement to say that he and his agency have engaged in long term efforts to obscure a study\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant link between vaccines and autism, heightened in African Americans boys. (The CDC says the data changes made were for legitimate reasons.)\nThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the current CDC immunization safety director who acknowledged to me that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible vaccines may rarely trigger autism in children who are biologically or genetically susceptible to vaccine injury.\nThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case of Hannah Poling, in which the government secretly admitted multiple vaccines given in one day triggered her brain injuries, including autism, then paid a multi-million dollar settlement, and had the case sealed from the prying public eyes under a confidentiality order.\nThere was the former head of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Bernadine Healy, who stoked her peers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ire by publicly stating that the vaccine-autism link was not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153myth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as so many tried to claim. She disclosed that her colleagues at the Institute of Medicine did not wish to investigate the possible link because they feared the impact it would have on the vaccination program.\nThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former CDC researcher Poul Thorsen, whose studies dispelled a vaccine autism link. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most wanted fugitive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after being charged with 13 counts of wire fraud and nine counts of money laundering for allegedly using CDC grants of tax dollars to buy a house and cars for himself.\nAnd there are the former scientists from Merck, maker of the MMR vaccine in question, who have turned into whistleblowers and\u00c2\u00a0accuse their company of committing vaccine fraud.\nRead: CDC Vaccine Information Statements \nThe Spin\nIf you want to review research and evidence on the other side, a simple Internet search will easily turn up everything you want to know. Those studies always seem to get covered in the news. They somehow turn up first in Google search results, along with the reports and blogs disparaging all opposing science and news reporting.\nYou might run across a February article in the New York Times. It treated the vaccine autism theory as if it comes down to a disagreement between emotionally fragile parents of autistic children and real research: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153faith\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feeling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd versus hard science.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some parents feel certain that vaccines can lead to autism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stated the article, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the vaccine-autism link has continued to be accepted on faith by some.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nYou might run across this network news story that uses Dr. Paul Offit as an expert on vaccine safety. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s introduced as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital of Philadelphia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153denies a connection with vaccination and autism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nSomehow, it goes unreported that Offit has made millions (he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disclose exactly how much) inventing a vaccine for Merck, which makes the MMR vaccine in question. Offit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rotavirus vaccine has, itself, been the subject of safety concerns. And his employment at Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital has been funded in part by $1.5 million given by Merck. In addition, he got caught giving false and disparaging information regarding a report I did exposing his financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry he so vigorously defends. His false statements were\u00c2\u00a0corrected\u00c2\u00a0by the publication that originally reported them. And Offit and his book publisher settled a libel accusation by a vaccine safety advocate who accused Offit of fabricating a disparaging conversation in his book: Autism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s False Prophets. Offit agreed to apologize, correct the book and make a donation to an autism charity.\nBut to the news: none of that matters. Offit is simply presented as an unbiased expert.\nThe supposedly best medical experts in the world who deny vaccines have anything to do with autism remain at an utter loss to explain this generation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s epidemic. To declare the science \u00e2\u20ac\u0153settled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the debate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153over\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is to defy the plain fact that many scientists worldwide are still sorting through it, and millions of people are still debating it.\nThe body of evidence on both sides is open to interpretation. People have every right to disbelieve the studies on one side. But it is disingenuous to pretend they do not exist.\nCDC recommended vaccine schedules\nanti-vaccine, astroturf, autism, dr. william thompson, pool thorsen, pro-vaccine, propaganda, the lewin group\nThank you Sharyl!  Thank you SO much!  This is a truly awesome article which is balanced and fair.  The truth is that thousands of parents have seen their children regress into autism after vaccines and in particular, the MMR.  The truth is that these parents are sidelined and ignored by those who are supposed to be protecting them from harmful medical products and treatments.  The truth is that corrupt organisations and companies will NEVER accept that vaccines cause autism because it will open the floodgates to such massive lawsuits that Big Pharma will not survive them.  This is not like the tobacco issue unfortunately because the medical profession was not built on tobacco, but it WAS built on vaccines.  It is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsacred cow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of medicine.  It is actually even worse than trying to discuss Israel or the holocaust.\nWhat is very obvious is that those who advocate health freedom are mostly sensible and polite but those who attack people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want vaccines are always rude, vicious, derogatory,  and scathing.\nThe truth is that there are between 270 and 300 vaccines waiting \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin the wings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to be foisted on the general public.  First they will be made available, then recommended and then mandated.  Those who accept the current toxic CDC schedule will soon start crying when they not only have to inject their children, but themselves.  Adults will soon be more restricted in their movements unless they have followed the mandated adult schedule.  Public transport, air travel, crossing state borders, any public service employment, corporate employment.  You name it, it will happen.\nThen the cry will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oh, but I thought this would apply to someone ELSE!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.\nyou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re barking up the wrong tree, the correct one is to answer this question: what are the long term effects of vaccines if taken according to the current recommended vaccination schedule comparing the vaccinated against non vaccinated?  the CDC refuses to do the study and there are a few independent studies which suggest that over the long term vaccines do more harm than good especially among boys. kids today are sicker than ever and a number of studies show this . The one thing we can safely conclude is that vaccines are not making kids healthier, and the last time I checked,  a healthy immune system is required to thwart disease.\nThe FDA and other gov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agencies are supposed to protect us from harmful ingredients. They are doing the exact opposite. One only has to read ingredient labels to see the truth. Read your food labels. Read your drink labels. Read the labels on products you use in your bathroom, kitchen, and laundry room. Read the labels on vaccines, and on any other labels you can find. \nWhat do you find? Tons of chemicals which have no business being put into or onto our bodies, and in many cases, even into our environment. Where is the FDA? Protecting the corporate interests of those very companies that are poisoning us.\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, examine the evidence for yourself, and you can only arrive at one conclusion, the FDA, our gov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, and the corporations which supply our food, water, personal care products, vaccines and medical\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.all are guilty of crimes against mankind. There is no other conclusion one can arrive at when merely examining the evidence in plain sight. It is common sense, but the majority is content with just listening to those who claim to know the science.  Simple common sense says that the science is lying. \nThanks Sharyl. The fact that any time a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153study\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd found no link to autism it makes worldwide news, but the other 101 studies showing concerns of a link to autism are routinely ignored on balance, suggests a great level of media complicity, with dark corrupt conflict of interest. for example, the chairman of Fairfax media Roger Corbett, also happens to be the chairman of Mayne pharmaceutical company! Dangerous liaisons to say the least, but it gets more sinsiter: Fairfax media control a website called http:\/\/www.essentialbaby.com which gives advice (and surprise, lots of unsolicited advice and scare stories of measles and whooping cough with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmake sure you vaccinate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as always the end conclusion). That douche needs to be exposed big time, as do other \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchairmen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of media boards who have vested interests in the pharmaceuticals pockets. It makes my blood boil, they are profiting from fear and biased, lop-sided stories.\nI believe that the study which is the starting point for this article was published in April and perhaps an earlier version of the present article was published then. I note that although September 17 is the given publication for this article the first extant reply is July 30 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indeed, I seem to remember reading it before. However, the study by Jain et al  was still being cited not only here but for other purposes by Dr Sanjay Gupta on CNN 5 days ago (18 Spetember 2015). These were some comments I made to a journalist in April:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Basically, they are comparing two groups that have been heavily MMRed but this is based on billing records \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know their vaccination status. Nor do they really know their autism status (they may very well not have gone to the insurer with the diagnosis). It focusses on MMR when many children may already be on a downward slope because of the many earlier vaccines. TOO MANY CONFOUNDERS The data is junk and they are comparing very odd things, not vaccinated vs unvaccinated. If you look at the discussion they admit many limitations in the data (why do it at all?)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The study which was commissioned by the NIH and touted as a clincher by Insel at the OGR committee last May is very weak and commissioned from a medical insurer and its satellites. Drexel University which hosted the study was the one that Thorsen was forced to resign from in 2010 and often partners with Offit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CHOP (for instance). Also note that Insel said it was due in 3 months on 20 May 2014, so it comes 8 months late, released a day ahead of crucial votes in California and Vermont. DROWNING IN CONFLICT\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThank you Sharyl. What an informative and insightful article. You have very well rounded off the main points succinctly, particularly in regards to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poo-pooing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of every legitimate article and findings pointing towards dangers of vaccines by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153skeptical science\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\/astroturfers\/shills. The media bias is something that is extremely disturbing. Where does this manifest from? Because not every station and paper is owned by Murdoch? Is there large payouts made to media by big pharma? Something happens of which we are seemingly unaware of. Deliberate bias, and pumping out of fear based propaganda for the vaccine cause. Where are all the human rights groups in both the U.S and Australia? They are awfully silent on this, given that basic human rights regarding medical consent are being breached, people oppressed, discriminated against, bullied and downtrodden, whilst the hyppoccratic oath which founded the medical world is ignored, as is the principles of the nuremburg code which forbids human experimentation without full consent. Shocking. Absolutely shocking.\nThe absurdity is overwhelming. A mom takes her healthy infant in for a round of vaccinations, and within minutes, in the car on the way home, the little girl begins high-pitched screaming, the classic sign of an encephalitic reaction. At home, only a few minutes after the baby finally falls asleep, the mom reenters the bedroom, to find her daughter in cardiac arrest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the mom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge of infant CPR saves her daughter. At the ER later, the mom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s told by the nurse that had she not intervened, her daughter would have been a case of SIDS. In the threads to the various posts of that story, many others state the same thing happened to their babies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cardiac arrest within hours of vaccination. Indeed, cardiac arrest is one of the vaccine injuries for which the national vaccine court has awarded over $3 billion.\nLogic dictates that many such cases go undetected by parents, the result, a minute being the determining factor, the silent death of the infant, and another reported case of SIDS. \nAnother mom takes her healthy one-year old in for the MMR vaccine. Again, the injury is immediately apparent, as the child develops a high fever, and is lethargic. The next morning the baby no longer responds, has lost contact, worsens over a period of weeks or months, ultimately to be diagnosed autistic.\n","209":"This is the 13th out of 13 most popular articles on Skeptical Raptor for the 2016 Year in Review. A while ago, I wrote an article about a father who is suing the New York Department of Education to force a school to allow his unvaccinated son into school. The basis of his lawsuit is that vaccination is against his religious beliefs.\nThe father\u00c2\u00a0is a Roman Catholic, and as far as I could find, the Catholic Church strongly supports vaccination, even making it a moral and ethical issue by clearly stating that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there would seem to be no proper grounds for refusing immunization against dangerous contagious diseases\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other words, not only is the Catholic Church not opposed to vaccination, it seems to indicate that it would immoral to not vaccinate.\nIn a comment on Facebook to my blog post, someone pointed me to a fascinating systematic review of the dogma of several religions with respect to vaccines and specific components of vaccines. The article was published in the highly respected and\u00c2\u00a0peer-reviewed medical journal,\u00c2\u00a0Vaccine, one of the top venues\u00c2\u00a0for vaccine research.\nThis peer reviewed piece was penned by John D Grabenstein, a religious expert on vaccines who happens to be employed by Merck, a major manufacturer of vaccines.\u00c2\u00a0Grabenstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s article is a review about religion and vaccines, and it was peer reviewed by others (see Note 1).\nIn the next section,\u00c2\u00a0I summarize the study\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s information about religion and vaccination \u00e2\u20ac\u201c specifically regarding the teachings of many of these religions. If you run across someone claiming that their religion is against vaccinations, you can check here, although, admittedly, the article only covers mainstream religions.\nHinduism. Hindus advocate for a respect for life, and thus, support technology that allows people to live longer and healthier. None of the four major sects of Hinduism have ever stated a concern with vaccination. Moreover, Hindus venerate cows, and thus do not eat beef, but no Hindu sect has opposed vaccines that are manufactured from bovine components. According to Grabenstein, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccination is widely accepted in predominantly\u00c2\u00a0Hindu countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nBuddhism. Around 1022-1063 CE, a written account described how a Buddhist nun used the process called variolation, which is a form of inoculation. In this case, she ground up smallpox scabs then put it in the nose of non-immune individuals, an early form of nasal vaccines I suppose. The 14th Dalai Lama, the current incumbent, was involved in a polio vaccination program. There are no religious texts or doctrine that oppose vaccines, and predominantly Buddhist countries are rather pro-vaccination.\nJainism. A small religion with just a small number (around 5-6 million) of adherents in a few countries. The author probably included them because of their strong belief in non-violence, which even makes it difficult for them to take antibiotics, which kill microorganisms. However, they have a strong tradition of allowing violent self-defense so that humans can\u00c2\u00a0survive (like killing animals for food, or vaccines causing the immune system to kill microorganisms), so vaccinations have never been prohibited by the religion.\nJudaism.\u00c2\u00a0Jews traditionally expect certain actions of its believers to maintain health and that would include vaccination. In addition, Judaism emphasizes the community over the individual in disease prevention, on of the more critical aspects of community wide vaccinations. In fact, Jewish scholars encouraged smallpox variolation in the era before the availability of vaccines. In the 1850s, distinguished Rabbi Yisroel Lipshutz described Edward Jenner as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153righteous gentile,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for his efforts in developing smallpox vaccination. (If I were a distinguished rabbi, I would add Jonas Salk and Paul Offit to righteous gentiles. Well, Salk was Jewish and I am unfamiliar with Offit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s religion, so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153righteous gentiles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd might not work.)\u00c2\u00a0Orthodox Rabbis have set aside Shabbat restrictions on observant Jews to get vaccinate in the not-too-distant past when vaccines were only intermittently available. One myth, debunked many time, is that because vaccines are often made of pork, and consumption of pork is restricted by Jewish dietary law. However, this prohibition of non-Kosher food, like pork, is usually agreed to mean oral consumption only, not when delivered by injection. Grabenstein concludes that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Based on this review, contemporary Jewish vaccine decliners are more likely to cite concerns about vaccine safety than to invoke a specific religious doctrine that has not been considered by acknowledged Jewish scholars.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nChristians. According to Grabenstein, most Christian churches have no specific scriptural or canonical objection to the use of vaccines. He included the following Christian churches in the list:\u00c2\u00a0Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches, Amish, Anglican, Baptist, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), Congregational, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Methodist (including African Methodist Episcopal), Pentecostal, Presbyterian, and Seventh-Day Adventist Church. Roman Catholics and some other denominations have expressed concerns about the aborted fetal tissues used in manufacturing some vaccines, although this concern has never included a formal restriction, by doctrine, of vaccination.\nAmish. One of the enduring myths of the vaccine deniers is that Amish communities do not get vaccinated. However, there is no prohibition against vaccines by the Amish church, and vaccination rates vary between different communities. And leaders of communities that get hit by a vaccine preventable disease outbreak are more often accepting of immunization.\nChristian Scientists (or more formally, Church of Christ, Scientist). Christian Scientists fundamentally believe that diseases are not real, and can be healed with focused prayer from one of their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153practitioners.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ironically, Christian Scientists do not have rules against vaccination, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s often recommended that they pray to be rid of any bad effects of the vaccine. Because Christian Scientist \u00e2\u20ac\u0153medical practitioners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lack knowledge of many rare vaccine preventable diseases, it can spread through one of their communities fairly quickly. In those cases, traditionally, the church accepts vaccination of their adherents.\nDutch Reformed Church. Members of this church have had a tradition of refusing vaccines going as far back as the early vaccinations for smallpox in the early 1800\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Most of this early vaccine refusal was because of the observed adverse events with the vaccines of that era (yeah, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an ongoing issue for vaccine deniers), although it has evolved into formal belief that vaccines interfere with the relationship with their god. Because of this vaccine refusal, there have been\u00c2\u00a0paralytic poliomyelitis, measles, congenital rubella syndrome, and mumps outbreaks. In 2013, a major outbreak of measles hit a Dutch Reformed community in the Netherlands, with 1226 reported cases.\u00c2\u00a0Of the 1,226 cases, 176 (14.4%) had complications including encephalitis (1 case), pneumonia (90 cases) and otitis media (66 cases) and 82 (6.7%) were admitted to hospital, which should debunk that belief that measles isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a serious disease.\nJehovah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Witnesses. This church has instructed its adherents to refuse transfusions of whole blood and the use of certain blood components, such as red blood cells, plasma, and other components\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthey consider the use of blood to be a violation of the law of their god. During the 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s through 40\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the church was opposed to vaccination based on their doctrine about human blood. However, by the early 1950\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the church took a neutral stance about vaccinations until the 1990\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when began to acknowledge the clinical value of vaccinations. They seem to strongly endorse the importance of hepatitis vaccinations.\nThis covers almost all of the mainstream religions. And aside from the Dutch Reformed Church, there does not appear to be a formal antivaccine doctrine in any of the major religions around the world. When someone makes a claim that their religion is opposed to vaccines, I become suspicious that it is just a smokescreen for a personal refusal of vaccinations, irrespective of actual religious doctrine.\nInterestingly, Islamic teaching states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153God (Allah) doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a disease without a cure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although there are many diseases without cures (which I believe is just a result of not enough time and research to discover said cure), I find this particular religious doctrine satisfying, as far as vaccines go.\nCompared to the nonsense spouted by some people who have no clue about what religions say about vaccines, the Islamic statements about vaccines is refreshing.\nGrabenstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meta-review of religious beliefs about vaccines uncover a major problem in the whole \u00e2\u20ac\u0153religious exemption\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to vaccines scam. If you cherry-picked information about any religion, you could probably make a convincing argument that the religion is opposed to vaccinations.\nOne\u00c2\u00a0ultra-orthodox sect of Judaism is very opposed to vaccines, but it is so far out of the mainstream Judaism, that I sincerely doubt any children in the sect would be going to a regular public school. What if a parent makes a claim that they are Jewish, and one rabbi says that vaccines are bad? Are we expecting a school administrator to ascertain the validity of their religion, or whether they actually adhere to that ultra-orthodox sect? Or to spend time investigating whether a parent is representing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd religion (in my world view, all religions are equally bogus) or some made-up version of some unknown religion?\nOne could argue that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let a school administrator make that decision, and that they should just accept the claims of the parent. But that breaks down the system of protecting children through vaccination.\nIf I were making the decision, all exemptions, personal or religious, would be immediately placed in abeyance or completely ended. Either vaccinate your children (unless there is a very strong case of the necessity of a medical exemption) or find a private school that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t demand vaccinations (if you can find one). Or another choice is to home school your child, but if he wants to go to college or to join a profession in healthcare, most colleges and training programs absolutely require vaccinations. Try becoming a physician without every vaccination\u00e2\u20ac\u201cyou can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even enter medical school without meeting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mandatory vaccination\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd standard. And there are rarely, if ever, exemptions.\nThe whole idea that antivaccination gangsters are abusing religious exemptions to put their children at harm is repugnant to me on so many levels. Including the fact that religion shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a factor in any decision about public schools.\nEditor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s note: This article was originally published in January\u00c2\u00a02014. It has been revised and updated\u00c2\u00a0to include more comprehensive information, to improve readability and to add current research. There were also extensive additions to the section on the Islamic faith and\u00c2\u00a0vaccines.\n                              ladycum                      \n                              septicflush                      \nIf the Catholic church doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any issues with vaccines, why did they post this on their website?.  (https:\/\/cogforlife.org\/sample-letter\/#more-501)   I am a bit confused here. Obviously, the Catholic church does have issues with some vaccines and does promote their parishioners to opt out of specific vaccines.  Also, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appreciate the blanket statement that all practitioners must get vaccinated.  I am a medical professional, and as far as I know, not all physicians, nurses, or other medical support are required to inoculated against all diseases.  They also have an opt out for conscious reasons.  Am I saying all vaccines are bad? No, but as a researcher in rehabilitation, our research shows that there has been an increase in reactions and debilitating injuries related to vaccines. Does this mean we should not vaccinate to protect ourselves and our children from diseases?  No.  What it does mean is that not only should education be done on the reason for the vaccine, but parents should be fully aware of the potential side effects and risks that are presented with the vaccine, which in most cases are glossed over during an examination when the child receives their inoculations.  The first step in preventing more damage is to educate consumers on the risks involved, on what to watch for, and on how to respond.  Neurological diseases, intestinal diseases, respiratory failure, and even death are a real result from vaccines for a small population, but still a result.  Families need to be educated on these factors as well.  For example, a young girl gets the HPV vaccine to prevent against cervical cancer.  Then within a few days starts failing. She ends up with acute respiratory failure becomes apneic and dependent on a ventilator to breath.   Because her neurological system is failing, a g-tube is placed to maintain nutrition, as well as other lines and tubes.  Now the family is devastated with large medical costs and the financial obligation to care for their invalid daughter.  They need to either hire several caretakers to provide assistance for her care or need to find a facility to manager her because the burden is so heavy.  Even if this was the only case we saw at our medical facility, it is still a risk that family took to supposedly protect their daughter.  When people understand all medicine has its risk, including the risk of death, they should be able to defend against those odds.  When can you say that it is morally right to choose between your life and another\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life?  If getting vaccinated means protecting your neighbor and your community, when does it become about your safety and quality of life?\n                              jillblue                      \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pro vaccines people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd denoting more than one person \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are ignoring science.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Well, there is good science and bad science. Good science is able to be peer reviewed multiple times, achieving similar or exactly the same results to an experiment. Bad science is typically using very small research groups, and because of that small experimental section, any peer reviews are very unlikely to be anywhere close. The later studies submitted by Dr. Herbert say absolutely nothing about vaccinations, and work with diet based \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for individual patients. Not a group study, but individuals on a case-by-case basis. They are also not accepted by reputable medical journals, and are exactly impossible to replicate because of the many variables involved in the case in question. Further, even Massachusetts courts have specifically barred her work from being submitted in law cases because of the issues I have previously stated. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153How can you expect to inject all those chemicals into a tiny defenseless babies [sic] and expect absolutely zero negative side effect from any of them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here is a basic lesson in chemistry for you. The oxygen you breathe is a chemical. The water you drink is a chemical. Breast milk, formula, food, etc. are all chemicals\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Infants are typically subjected and more vulnerable to hostile bacteria and viruses than adults specifically because their immune systems have not developed to the extent ours have. They simply haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come into contact with those different bacteria and viruses. Which is why we vaccinate them. \nBecause of issues within the usage of thalidomide (which was used to treat nausea in pregnant women), it was withdrawn for a time as a drug on the market. Thimerosal was a preservative used in many vaccines, and approved for use in small amounts for 3 different vaccines. Because it was used past the acceptable limits of exposure by the EPA, it was withdrawn from the market here in the United States as usable in vaccines, with the exception of the influenza vaccine. IT IS NO LONGER USED!\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love for you to cite your statement that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Surveys always show that parents who are more educated are also less likely to vaccinate their kids.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Are these random surveys? Surveys conducted by phone? Surveys conducted by some kiddo on Facebook that asks for all their friends to take the survey for a random school project? By the way, I hope you realize that surveys aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nearly as reputable as studies. There are no ways to double check the participants statements. I could tell you that I went to Harvard and achieved a Ph.D in some random field, but I would be lying, and you would have absolutely no way to check it. \n                              septicflush                      \n                              Mokelly123                      \nMy name is Tetyana Obukhanych. I hold a PhD in Immunology. I am writing this letter in the hope that it will correct a few common misperceptions about vaccines and help you formulate a fair and balanced understanding that is supported by accepted vaccine theory and new scientific findings.\nDo unvaccinated children pose a higher threat to the public than the vaccinated?\nIt is often stated that those who choose not to vaccinate their children for reasons of conscience endanger the rest of the public, and this is the rationale behind most of the legislation to end vaccine exemptions currently being considered by federal and state legislators country-wide. You should be aware that the nature of protection afforded by many modern vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that includes most of the vaccines recommended by the CDC for children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not consistent with such a statement. I have outlined below the recommended vaccines that cannot prevent transmission of disease either because they are not designed to prevent the transmission of infection (rather, they are intended to prevent disease symptoms), or because they protect from non-communicable diseases. People who have not received the vaccines mentioned below pose no higher threat to the general public than those who have, implying that discrimination against non-immunized children in a public school setting may not be warranted.\nIPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine) cannot prevent transmission of poliovirus (see appendix for the scientific study, Item #1). Wild poliovirus has been non-existent in the USA for at least two decades. Even if wild poliovirus were to be re- imported by travel, vaccinating for polio with IPV cannot affect the safety of public spaces. Please note that wild poliovirus eradication is attributed to the use of a different vaccine, OPV or oral poliovirus vaccine. Despite being capable of preventing wild poliovirus transmission, use of OPV was phased out long ago in the USA and replaced with IPV due to safety concerns.\nTetanus is not a contagious disease, but rather acquired from deep-puncture wounds contaminated with C. tetani spores. Vaccinating for tetanus (via the DTaP combination vaccine) cannot alter the safety of public spaces; it is intended to render personal protection only.\nWhile intended to prevent the disease-causing effects of the diphtheria toxin, the diphtheria toxoid vaccine (also contained in the DTaP vaccine) is not designed to prevent colonization and transmission of C. diphtheriae. Vaccinating for diphtheria cannot alter the safety of public spaces; it is likewise intended for personal protection only.\nThe acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine (the final element of the DTaP combined vaccine), now in use in the USA, replaced the whole cell pertussis vaccine in the late 1990s, which was followed by an unprecedented resurgence of whooping cough. An experiment with deliberate pertussis infection in primates revealed that the aP vaccine is not capable of preventing colonization and transmission of B. pertussis (see appendix for the scientific study, Item #2). The FDA has issued a warning regarding this crucial finding.[1]\nFurthermore, the 2013 meeting of the Board of Scientific Counselors at the CDC revealed additional alarming data that pertussis variants (PRN-negative strains) currently circulating in the USA acquired a selective advantage to infect those who are up-to-date for their DTaP boosters (see appendix for the CDC document, Item #3), meaning that people who are up-to-date are more likely to be infected, and thus contagious, than people who are not vaccinated.\nAmong numerous types of H. influenzae, the Hib vaccine covers only type b. Despite its sole intention to reduce symptomatic and asymptomatic (disease-less) Hib carriage, the introduction of the Hib vaccine has inadvertently shifted strain dominance towards other types of H. influenzae (types a through f). These types have been causing invasive disease of high severity and increasing incidence in adults in the era of Hib vaccination of children (see appendix for the scientific study, Item #4). The general population is more vulnerable to the invasive disease now than it was prior to the start of the Hib vaccination campaign. Discriminating against children who are not vaccinated for Hib does not make any scientific sense in the era of non-type b H. influenzae disease.\nHepatitis B is a blood-borne virus. It does not spread in a community setting, especially among children who are unlikely to engage in high-risk behaviors, such as needle sharing or sex. Vaccinating children for hepatitis B cannot significantly alter the safety of public spaces. Further, school admission is not prohibited for children who are chronic hepatitis B carriers. To prohibit school admission for those who are simply unvaccinated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and do not even carry hepatitis B \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would constitute unreasonable and illogical discrimination. \nIn summary, a person who is not vaccinated with IPV, DTaP, HepB, and Hib vaccines due to reasons of conscience poses no extra danger to the public than a person who is. No discrimination is warranted.\nHow often do serious vaccine adverse events happen?\nIt is often stated that vaccination rarely leads to serious adverse events. Unfortunately, this statement is not supported by science. A recent study done in Ontario, Canada, established that vaccination actually leads to an emergency room visit for 1 in 168 children following their 12-month vaccination appointment and for 1 in 730 children following their 18-month vaccination appointment (see appendix for a scientific study, Item #5).\nWhen the risk of an adverse event requiring an ER visit after well-baby vaccinations is demonstrably so high, vaccination must remain a choice for parents, who may understandably be unwilling to assume this immediate risk in order to protect their children from those diseases that are generally considered mild or that their children may never be exposed to.\nCan discrimination against families who oppose vaccines for reasons of conscience prevent future disease outbreaks of communicable viral diseases, such as measles?\nMeasles research scientists have for a long time been aware of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153measles paradox.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I quote from the article by Poland & Jacobson (1994) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Failure to Reach the Goal of Measles Elimination: Apparent Paradox of Measles Infections in Immunized Persons.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Arch Intern Med 154:1815-1820:\nFurther research determined that behind the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153measles paradox\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is a fraction of the population called LOW VACCINE RESPONDERS. Low-responders are those who respond poorly to the first dose of the measles vaccine. These individuals then mount a weak immune response to subsequent RE-vaccination and quickly return to the pool of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153susceptibles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 within 2-5 years, despite being fully vaccinated.[3]\nStudies of measles outbreaks in Quebec, Canada, and China attest that outbreaks of measles still happen, even when vaccination compliance is in the highest bracket (95-97% or even 99%, see appendix for scientific studies, Items #6&7). This is because even in high vaccine responders, vaccine-induced antibodies wane over time. Vaccine immunity does not equal life-long immunity acquired after natural exposure.\nIt has been documented that vaccinated persons who develop breakthrough measles are contagious. In fact, two major measles outbreaks in 2011 (in Quebec, Canada, and in New York, NY) were re-imported by previously vaccinated individuals.[6]-[7]\nTaken together, these data make it apparent that elimination of vaccine exemptions, currently only utilized by a small percentage of families anyway, will neither solve the problem of disease resurgence nor prevent re- importation and outbreaks of previously eliminated diseases. \nIs discrimination against conscientious vaccine objectors the only practical solution?\nThe majority of measles cases in recent US outbreaks (including the recent Disneyland outbreak) are adults and very young babies, whereas in the pre-vaccination era, measles occurred mainly between the ages 1 and 15. Natural exposure to measles was followed by lifelong immunity from re-infection, whereas vaccine immunity wanes over time, leaving adults unprotected by their childhood shots. Measles is more dangerous for infants and for adults than for school-aged children.\nDespite high chances of exposure in the pre-vaccination era, measles practically never happened in babies much younger than one year of age due to the robust maternal immunity transfer mechanism. The vulnerability of very young babies to measles today is the direct outcome of the prolonged mass vaccination campaign of the past, during which their mothers, themselves vaccinated in their childhood, were not able to experience measles naturally at a safe school age and establish the lifelong immunity that would also be transferred to their babies and protect them from measles for the first year of life.\nLuckily, a therapeutic backup exists to mimic now-eroded maternal immunity. Infants as well as other vulnerable or immuno-compromised individuals, are eligible to receive immunoglobulin, a potentially life-saving measure that supplies antibodies directed against the virus to prevent or ameliorate disease upon exposure (see appendix, Item #8).\nIn summary: 1) due to the properties of modern vaccines, non-vaccinated individuals pose no greater risk of transmission of polio, diphtheria, pertussis, and numerous non-type b H. influenzae strains than vaccinated individuals do, non-vaccinated individuals pose virtually no danger of transmission of hepatitis B in a school setting, and tetanus is not transmissible at all; 2) there is a significantly elevated risk of emergency room visits after childhood vaccination appointments attesting that vaccination is not risk-free; 3) outbreaks of measles cannot be entirely prevented even if we had nearly perfect vaccination compliance; and 4) an effective method of preventing measles and other viral diseases in vaccine-ineligible infants and the immuno-compromised, immunoglobulin, is available for those who may be exposed to these diseases.\nTaken together, these four facts make it clear that discrimination in a public school setting against children who are not vaccinated for reasons of conscience is completely unwarranted as the vaccination status of conscientious objectors poses no undue risk to the public. \n                              T1mB0                      \n                              septicflush                      \n                              septicflush                      \n                              septicflush                      \n                              septicflush                      \n                              kellymbray                      \n                              det0918                      \nI follow no man, as ALL men can be corrupted.

Infected people have entered the U.S. from countries where measles is endemic and isolated outbreaks have sprung up periodically.\nA resurgence of measles in the past two years has\u00c2\u00a0stoked public health concerns.

And therefore it should be undertaken only after careful consideration of its risks versus its benefits.\nThe dangers of vaccines are real, can be substantial and life-long, and for some, life ending. Additionally vaccines:\nVaccines are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unavoidably unsafe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and contain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unavoidable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd viruses, phages (viruses that infect bacteria), and contaminants. No other drug or medical product is similarly manufactured \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if contaminants are found in them, the product is recalled. The FDA even recalls food when contaminants are found.\nSome of the viruses contaminating vaccines have a known effect, as in the case of the simian virus SV-40 that causes cancer (see Cross-Species Contamination below). Other effects are unknown. In 1975 Gena Bari Kolata wrote an article[i] in the journal Science in which scientists at the FDA admit that all live virus vaccines are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grossly contaminated with phages,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd even though it was against FDA regulations at that time. Rather than recall the vaccines, the FDA changed the rules so that a recall wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause undue concern for parents. In 1987 the FDA decided this about vaccines: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seed virus used in manufacture shall be demonstrated to be free of extraneous microbial agents except for unavoidable bacteriophage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd[ii] Bovine (cow) serum is a frequently used vaccine growth medium and the most frequently contaminated animal serums with bacteriophage.\nVaccines have many other agents as well as the viruses and contaminants that can cause significant injury (see the full list below) to a child or adult. These injuries include brain swelling and permanent brain injury, seizures and convulsions, blood disorders, and even death. Since 1988 over 3.4 billion dollars in compensation has been paid by the federal government to vaccine victims. And yes, they have paid for autism. Studies have definitively shown that vaccines can result in autism, a disease that has increased from 1 in 10,000 in 1990, to 1 in 150 in 2000, to the current rate of 1 in 68 children. According to the CDC, the most recent numbers breakdown to 1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls diagnosed with autism.\nWhile other environmental assaults are also associated with autism, the increased vaccination schedule can be the trigger or a significant contributing factor especially in children who are predisposed because of other conditions. These other conditions are often unknown and not symptomatic until the vaccine injury triggers a cascade of problems.\nVaccines Are Unavoidably Unsafe\nAccording to the US Food and Drug Administration, safety assessments for vaccines have not often included toxicity studies because vaccines have not been viewed as inherently toxic. Yet vaccines are legally defined as unavoidably unsafe.\nIt is not just childhood vaccines that come with substantial risk. Influenza vaccines, vaccines for sexually transmitted diseases, and others contain similar risks for adverse events. Also troubling is that vaccination is recommended now for pregnant women, even though vaccine package inserts clearly state they have not been tested on pregnant women, so the effects on the fetus can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be known.\nIn the 1960s only a handful of childhood vaccines were given. The current CDC recommended vaccine schedule for children now has over 30 vaccines by the time a child turns 6 and an additional potential for up to 30 more by the time they reach 18. Could this increase be linked to our declining health? For example, currently:\nSince genetic mutations change slowly over generations, we must look to environmental causes for these changes. While other environmental toxins certainly are at play in these statistics, disregarding the potential role to the amounts of toxin injected into children through vaccines is not only bad public policy, it is bad science. By disregarding the role of vaccines in our statistics for infant mortality and chronic diseases, we could be doing more harm than good in mandating, or even advising, them.\nVaccine Adverse Effects: Known Risks\nThe list of adverse side effects for vaccines is long and troubling. A quick scan of the Vaccine Injury Table kept by the Health Resource Center for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reveals that compensation for injury is possible from a variety of the most common vaccines given to children.\nAdverse events are the reason the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has paid out over 3 billion dollars from 1988 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2016 despite the fact that only 1 in 5 claims receives any compensation at all. Studies reveal that a small fraction of those injured by vaccines ever file any claim at all since most doctors reject the notion that a problem was caused by a vaccine despite the reality that such problems are listed on the manufacturers product insert. You can learn more by reading this fficial document: National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\nVaccines: Adverse Effects List\nVarious vaccines are linked to the following serious adverse reactions:\nYou can find more adverse reactions reported on the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database.\nMitochondrial Dysfunction and Vaccines\nPeople have varied genetic makeup and individual responses so there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a way to tell if a given vaccine will provide the benefit of immunity, cause the illness it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meant to prevent, or cause mild and\/or serious neurologic illness or other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adverse events\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (including death) following vaccination in some individuals.\nVaccines are known to be problematic for a segment of the population with a specific mitochondrial genetic mutation which may affect up to 4,000 babies a year. Some of those with a particular form of this dysfunction are unable to detoxify the poisons such as aluminum or mercury that are in the vaccine. This inability to detoxify the metals causes damage to multiple organ systems with sometimes devastating results.\nIn his 2004 testimony to Congress, Dr. Rashid Buttar\u00c2\u00a0[iv] (former vice chair of the American Board of Clinical Metal Toxicology and scientist at North Carolina State University) said that children with autism suffer from acute mercury toxicity which results in many imbalances, including systemic candidiastis, immune-suppression, immune dysfunctions, and gastrointestinal dysbiosis. He calls these conditions fires which resulted from one spark: mercury, including (and exacerbated by) the mercury in trace amounts still in childhood vaccines.\nInadequate Testing of Vaccines\nThe problems associated with vaccines should lead manufacturers to conduct stringent testing. However, quite the opposite is true. In vaccine testing there is:\nSafety or toxicity of vaccines is studied for short term rather than long-term. Many studies are limited to just a few weeks. When a vaccine is tested, it is given to healthy people and they are only given that one injection (not multiple injections at once, like a baby). The current CDC recommended schedule with a number of vaccines injected on a given day has never been tested. In essence, the current schedule is an experiment.\nVaccines Introduced 1985-1991 Were Not Studied For Autism\nChronic health conditions in children began growing rapidly at the same time that new vaccines were introduced 1985-1991, now impacting 1 in 2 adolescents.\u00c2\u00a0 Autism, ADHD, food allergies, bowel diseases, and other conditions began growing exponentially in the late 1980s.\nThe Hib vaccine was introduced in 1985, and replaced by the Hib conjugate vaccine in 1988, to avoid a death rate of 1 per 106,000 persons.\u00c2\u00a0 The Hepatitis B vaccine was introduced for newborns in 1991 to avoid the risk of transmission from the mother which can occur in 1 in 480 births.\u00c2\u00a0 HepB is a blood-borne illness not transmitted by casual contact, so an infant is not at risk unless the mother is HepB-positive.\u00c2\u00a0Learn more by reading the report created by\u00c2\u00a0Foundation for Pediatric Health.\nVaccine Additives: Mercury, and Aluminum\nOne traditional rule in medicine is that things are unsafe until proven otherwise. Despite this, and the understanding that aluminum is a neurotoxin, scientists still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand exactly what aluminum does in the vaccine.\nAccording to a 2007 article entitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Neurological Adverse Events of Immunization: Experience With an Aluminum Adjuvanted Meningococcal B Outer Membrane Vesicle Vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on MedScape, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aluminum salts (aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate and alum) have been the main adjuvants used in vaccines for almost 80 years and are the only adjuvants currently licensed for use in humans in the USA. Despite the long experience, the mechanism of action still appears unclear. For many years, the main effect of alum was believed to be keeping the active antigen at the injection site and, therefore, available for initial interaction with the immune system. However, experimental studies have shown that the antigen disappears from the injection site within a few hours. The most important mechanism of alum is probably mediated through activation of antigen-presenting cells. Aluminum adjuvants also strongly influence the type of immune response and are important for stimulation of antibody production but probably do not induce cell-mediated immunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nTwo things stand out: researchers are not sure what aluminum adjuvants do exactly but they guess that whatever action is relevant does not include cell-mediated immunity. Cell-mediated immunity creates actual immunity; antibody production alone does not.\nThis particular paper goes on to describe many adverse effects of the aluminum adjuvant, including serious neurological dysfunction, but the authors insist that most of the adverse effects are coincidental and not causal. Even when the authors admit to vaccine-induced adverse events, they say that the vaccine is still better for most people than the life-long problems experienced by those injured.\nThis paper also notes that in developing new adjuvants for vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In-depth studies demonstrating the overall effect of the adjuvants on the immune system will be necessary to avoid surprising and negative consequences \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 However, should there be the more serious events occurring in less than one in 10,000 vaccines, they will only be revealed when the vaccine is taken into general use.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other words, the general population is the completion of their experiment for safety.\nMercury, another heavy metal and known neurotoxin, is in all inactivated flu vaccines where it is used as a preservative in the form of thimerosal. Though thimerosal is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines, it remains present in them in in trace amounts since it is part of the manufacturing process. However, those trace amounts still exceeds the FDA recommended amounts that can be ingested. Vaccines are injected rather than ingested. So is there a safe amount to inject? We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know because that research has never been done. The FDA ordered such studies in 1982; the CDC still has not commissioned such a study.\nMercury, even in small trace amounts, is harmful. Exposure to any mercury is problematic because like aluminum, it also accumulates in the brain causing many forms of neurological damage that affects movement, learning, and social behaviors. Mercury is 500 times more toxic than lead and is second only to plutonium as the most toxic metal known to man. Mercury poisoning and the symptoms of autism are strikingly similar.\nSince it takes years for mercury to be metabolized out of the body, its effects are also cumulative. Mercury is especially harmful to fetuses, infants, and young children since their brains are still developing.\nOne final problem with mercury is that combining it with other metals, such as aluminum, exponentially increases its toxicity. In one recent study done at the University of British Columbia, researchers placed brain neurons in a dish and video recorded the reaction of the neurons when adding aluminum and mercury in the amounts that corresponded to vaccines. When the researchers added aluminum to the brain cells, the neurons withered and shrunk noticeably. When they then added mercury to the aluminum damaged cell, the destruction continued and was more rapid and intense. When they then added testosterone to the mercury\/aluminum mixture, the destruction of the neural cell was profound.\nVaccine Ingredients, How They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Made and How They Work\nA clearer understanding of how vaccines are made and what they do raises even more questions about the risk\/benefit ratio.\nVaccines work by stimulating and exciting an immune response. The efficacy of a vaccine is measured by the production of antibodies. This stimulation of antibody production is achieved (or not) when either a live or killed virus or other vaccine agent is injected into a child or adult. The theory is that this antibody response will then be replicated to protect the vaccinated individual from future exposures.\nFor live virus vaccines, a virus is grown on mediums that include aborted fetal tissue and tissues from monkeys, cows, chickens, dogs, mice, and other animals. Growing the live viruses on animal cells is supposed to make them less virulent to humans yet still strong enough to induce an immune response. This virus is then manufactured with a variety of additives and preservatives to make the serum injected as a vaccine.\nNon-live virus vaccines include bacterial toxins, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153killed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whole virus, and proteins (among other things) and require the use of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adjuvants\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to stimulate an immune response. These adjuvant-stimulated responses create the antibodies that are the measures of success of the vaccine. However the antibodies are not necessarily effective measures of true immunity from either live or non-live vaccines.\nAdditionally, the concept of Original Antigenic Sin\u00c2\u00a0calls into question whether the immune response from a vaccine (live virus or otherwise) could ever provide adequate protection.\nThe most commonly used vaccine adjuvant is aluminum, a heavy metal that is a known neurotoxin associated with brain dysfunctions, including dementia and Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease. Aluminum can last up to eight years in the brain resulting in cumulative neurological damage from additional exposures.\nVaccines and Autism\nDespite all the reporting to the contrary, vaccines have been definitively linked to autism. In 1986, a class-action lawsuit against vaccine manufacturers by hundreds of parents whose children experienced regressive autism following vaccination resulted in legislation that absolved vaccine makers from liability and created a program which pays compensation for injury. As the class-action case wound its way through that system, most of those parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 claims were rejected until Hannah Poling. Her case was championed by her father, Jon Poling, MD, PhD, a neurologist and professor at the Medical College of Georgia.\nAccording to the 2011 article \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unanswered Questions from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program: A Review of Compensated Cases of Vaccine-Induced Brain Injury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Pace Environmental Law Review, in order to file a claim of injury in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, parents of injured children are pressured to blame any autism spectrum brain injuries on non-autism causes. Typical symptoms of autism such as brain swelling (encephalitis) and seizures have been compensated for as long as parents define them as side effects of the vaccine rather than calling them symptoms of regressive autism caused by the vaccine.[vii]\u00c2\u00a0Today 1 in 68 children has Autism according to the CDC.\nNumerous studies listed at the US National Library of Medicine National Institute of Health, link vaccines to autism. Several online articles suggest a correlation between the uses of aborted human fetal cells with the coincidental rise of autism.\nOne such study is Timing of Increased Autistic Disorder Cumulative Incidence by Michael E. McDonald and John F. Paul, NHEERL\/EPA, published in February 2010 in Vol. 44 of the Environmental Science & Technology journal. It reports that a spike in autism seen in 1995 corresponds with the introduction of human DNA to the MMR vaccine, suggesting a possible link.\nOne very troubling danger that results from the way vaccines are produced is cross-species viral contamination. For example, the SV 40 virus, a simian virus, was transferred from monkeys to humans by growing the polio virus on monkey kidneys; the SV 40 virus causes human cancers (Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 1997). The virus was injected into hundreds of millions of healthy people worldwide who received early versions of polio vaccines from 1955 -1963.\nAccording to an article published and available from The National Center for Biotechnology Information  in a 2007 review of numerous studies about SV40 in humans, researches said the following: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SV40 footprints in humans have been found associated at high prevalence with specific tumor types such as brain and bone tumors, mesotheliomas and lymphomas and with kidney diseases\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Once infected, people with SV40 can pass the virus on to their children.\nKnowing Vaccine Risk and Contraindications\nVaccines are defined as unavoidably unsafe by the CDC, the FDA, HHS, and legal precedent. Yet there is only minimal benefit to individuals and the community for protection from diseases that are unlikely to cause either severe illness or death outside of Third World countries.\nThe risks for each vaccine are stated right on the vaccine package inserts but these inserts are not given to parents or even to adults considering the suggested vaccines for them. It is also doubtful that the doctor or nurse dispensing the vaccine has fully read the product insert. For example, do doctors know that the Sanofi Pasteur Tripeda PI lists autism as one of the serious post marketing reactions to their MMR vaccine?[v] If parents knew that, they might reconsider giving the child the vaccine.\nWhen patients ask for product information, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re given an abridged version, one that would be unlikely to contain the full list of adverse events. That patients do not get the inserts can be especially problematic when pharmacists dispense flu vaccines; pharmacists do not have the same relationship with the patient and will not necessarily be aware of contraindications for a particular person.\nA full list of contraindications and adverse events listed in the package inserts is available on the Immunization Action Coalition website. While the incidence of any particular adverse reaction listed on the insert may not be unacceptable in the eyes of the manufacturer or the CDC, every parent has both the duty and right to know what they are so that they can decide whether the benefit outweighs the risk for their child or themselves.\nScientific literature also shows that the vaccines can cause the diseases they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re meant to prevent, such as in the case of measles, whooping cough, and chicken pox (and others) when the vaccinated child sheds virus to family and community members, even if the child shows no symptoms. More troubling is that outbreaks are now occurring more often in late teen\/young adult populations a time when childhood disease are more problematic. This shows that whatever immunity was originally conferred wears off over time. The only solution is even more boosters.\nYet if these individuals had gotten the infections in childhood, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have life-long immunity. Plus that immunity would be able to be passed from mother to child in breast milk, thus protecting the infant in the first years of life when they are most at risk for complications. This benefit does not exist in vaccine-induced immunity and therefore puts infants at greater risk for acquiring the infections in infancy rather than childhood.\nNon-existent Benefit: Vaccine Antibodies Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Guarantee Immunity\nVaccine makers do not guarantee that their product does anything more than increase antibody levels in most people. They further admit that such antibodies do not necessarily mean immunity from illness.\nFor example, the Galaxo-Smith-Kline flu vaccine insert states: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Specific levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer post vaccination with inactivated influenza virus vaccines have not been correlated with protection from influenza illness but the HI antibody titers have been used as a measure of vaccine activity. In some human challenge studies, HI antibody titers of \u00e2\u2030\u00a51:40 have been associated with protection from influenza illness in up to 50% of subjects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIn simple language this means that the manufacturer does not claim that the flu vaccine protects from the flu; they only claim that it increases antibody activity in some people. However the increased antibody activity has only been associated with protection from the flu for half of the subjects whose antibodies reach the appropriate mark. For the other half, it is useless.\nSome reports from analysis of the effectiveness of flu vaccines shows that they have up to an 84% failure rate. One reason for such a high failure rate is that the antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers little or no protection against another virus. Furthermore, the antibody for one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against another antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virological basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza viruses in each year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influenza vaccine.\nMerck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chicken pox vaccine has similar wording about effectiveness on its insert: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153VARIVAX induces both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to varicella-zoster virus. The relative contributions of humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity to protection from varicella are unknown.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThis claims that the vaccine induces both the innate and humoral immune system responses yet they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if the contribution is effective protection.\nSo, the benefits for vaccination in a healthy, well-nourished child or adult, it seems then, are not substantial. However, the risks associated with vaccines are substantial.\nScience Fraud and the Media\nGetting credible independent scientific evidence for vaccines is not always easy. As was the case with the tobacco industry, pharmaceutical companies pay either directly or indirectly for much of the science that is published. The revolving door of officials in government moving into highly paid positions in the pharmaceutical industry or lobbying also is problematic. The government seems to have a vested interest in not publishing information that would show vaccines in a poor light.\nFor example, in a statement released in August 2014 on his lawyer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, CDC scientist William Thompson, PhD, admits to falsifying data that showed a statistical connection between the MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders in African American boys who are given the vaccine before the age of three. Dr. Thompson published a paper in the journal Pediatrics claiming there was no connection. Ten years later, he admitted his fraud after conversations he had with another scientist were recorded without his knowledge. Part of that release reads:\nMy name is William Thompson. \u00c2\u00a0I am a Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where I have worked since 1998. I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.\nWhile Thompson still believes that the risk from disease is greater than the risk from vaccines, it is doubtful that many families whose children have autism would agree with him. He has not lost his job or been prosecuted for his admitted fraud.\nIn another case, a scientific journal rather than a doctor perpetrated the fraud. The case of Andrew Wakefield, MD, made news when he was accused of fraud for a paper he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d authored with multiple colleagues. The paper had appeared in the British journal Lancet in 1998 and it linked a gastrointestinal problem with autism; the authors suspected the gastrointestinal problem was caused by vaccination. Allegations of fraud, improper ethics, and conflict of interests were made by a reporter in 2004 who worked for Rupert Murdock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sunday Times. The reporter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegations were disputed not only by the authors but also by the editors of Lancet and the institution where the research was conducted, University College London. However the accusations gained traction when members of Parliament became interested and held hearings.\nMedia that included the scientific journal, the British Medical Journal (BMJ), and traditional media launched a vicious attack blitz against Wakefield and his colleagues. The original research paper was eventually withdrawn by Lancet and the authors charged with fraud by the Royal College of Medicine and the courts. Ten of the 13 co-authors caved to the pressure but the three authors who refused to retract their findings were found guilty and stripped of their medical licenses. The headlines went worldwide condemning the men and the connection they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d tangentially made to vaccines and autism.\nHowever, the original paper and its authors were eventually exonerated after more than a decade of struggle against their attackers. Those facts did not make any headlines in any media. The doctors were returned to the medical register, though no apology was forthcoming.\nThe reporter who originally leveled the false charges won prestigious news awards, which were not withdrawn even when it was shown in court proceedings that he had reported falsely, hid relevant exculpatory documents, and had many conflicts of interest. The reporters ally, the editor of the BMJ, admitted that the BMJ receives advertising and sponsorship revenue from GSK and Merck (MMR manufacturers).\nThe BMJ editor, in testimony before Parliament, admitted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even on the peer review side of things, it has been said that the journals are a marketing arm of the pharmaceutical industry. That is not untrue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd[vi]\nWhat other information is spread falsely? One piece gaining traction is that women, children and the elderly should have routine flu vaccines.\nInfluenza Vaccines, Pregnant Women, Children & the Elderly\nPregnant women and the elderly are now encouraged, even shamed or browbeaten, into getting flu vaccines. Here is a sample of the wording on influenza vaccine inserts (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost exactly the same for all the influenza vaccines listed on IAC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website):\nIf the package inserts say the flu vaccine has not been established as safe for pregnant women, is not very effective in the elderly, and causes problems in small children, why is it being pushed now at such an extreme level?\nVaccines, Foreign DNA, and Chronic Disease\nIn addition to the list of known adverse effects, and that vaccines have been definitely linked to the spread of the cancer causing SV-40 virus (simian virus 40) in humans, what other problems are we creating?\nScientists are also correlating the huge rise of chronic autoimmune diseases with the increased rise in numbers of vaccines given. While other environmental factors also contribute to the rise of chronic disease, vaccines cannot be eliminated as a contributing or causal factor.\nWhen foreign DNA is injected into humans, the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune response is to attack that foreign DNA. When that foreign animal DNA attaches to the human cells, the immune response includes attacking its own cells. Animal DNA or foreign fetal cell DNA in vaccines can also be taken up by an individual and recombined into their DNA. Also, according to Helen Ratajczak, a former senior scientist at a pharmaceutical firm, there is a link to brain damage and human DNA in vaccines.\nAside from the DNA issue, that some vaccines are grown on aborted fetal tissue is an issue for people with a moral or religious objection for abortion. (Vaccines that contain aborted fetal tissue can be found online here http:\/\/www.soundchoice.org\/certification.html.)\nThere is a limit to how much foreign material our bodies can handle before genetic damage occurs. Each person has his or her own unique genetic blueprint which responds to foreign substances differently. It appears that many children are hitting that limit.\nThis generation of children in the United States is sicker than any previous generation with over 50% of children experiencing one or more chronic illness. Many of those illnesses are autoimmune diseases. The US ranks 19th among developed nations in infant mortality. It also has the most highly vaccinated children beginning on the day a child is born.\nCould these terrible statistics be linked to the cumulative adverse effects of too many doses of vaccines?\nWhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Parent to Do?\nLearn more. Be your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best advocate (and your own).\n The Vaccine Research Library has a collection of more than 6,500 articles gleaned from peer-reviewed journals. The articles document conflicts of interest in medical research, and chronicle and present undeniable evidence of vaccine injury that includes allergies, autoimmune disease, and a long list of neurological disturbances.\nThe US National Library of Medicine has more than 300 research studies regarding vaccine dangers: http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/guide\/health-guide-vaccine-research.\nThe CDC collects doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reports of thousands of serious vaccine reactions each year including hundreds of deaths and permanent disabilities. http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/ss5201a1.htm#tab3 http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/ss5201a1.htm http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/MMWR\/PDF\/ss\/ss5201.pdf\nFollow the money\n As you do your research, be mindful of who benefits from the information you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reading. Ask: Who paid for the study? Who made the campaign contributions? Who paid for the advertising? Pharmaceutical companies have deep pockets and they spread their money around in ways that suit them best. The big question is, does what suits the pharmaceutical industry benefit our children?\nContact your members of Congress\n Before any mandates become law that we must vaccinate our kids, demand independent investigations into the manufactures of vaccines, their adjuvants, excipients, and growing mediums. We deserve that kind of transparency and not bureaucratic, corporate, and media spin.\nEndnotes\n[i] www.sciencemag.org\/content\/187\/4176\/522.extract\n[ii] Wade Baker and Rita Baker, Plaintiffs-Appelants, v.

Give us chicken pox, measles etc.. I had it all as a kid and I survived and so did the majority or people.. The explosion of autism and special needs kids has exploded with the increase of vaccines.. I pray people wake up and stop following the propaganda and do your own research.\nSteve Smith Both my children (now adults) suffered repeated infections and illnesses during childhood including strep throat, ear infections, allergies, colds\/flu.\nDanielle Graham My oldest son and step son are on the spectrum after vaccinations. My son had severe asthma, my step son febrile seizures. My youngest son has severe asthma\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nJoann Ciccone-fariello I have children who are vacinne injured and also grandchildren. I myself and sister have severe eczema since childhood.\nSara Autumn-Breeze Smith My two year old has never received a vax because my 6year old brother DIED of meningitis within a few days of receiving a vaccine for it. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s short, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s # truth He shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have received it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.he had an immune deficiency already, it was just too much. This is exactly why they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t force anything! Everyone reacts differently.\nTana Jackson My son who is now 17 was four weeks premature and they gave him the hep B shot. He stopped breathing they saved him! But he had to be in an incubator for 15 days. Came home on a heart monitor and he had sleep apnea. Later found out that sleep apnea is a repercussion from the hep B shot. He is still always sick and unhealthy.\nStephanie Byers Ticks are a vaccine injury?? My husband has a tick. He already blames his stupid annual army flu shot for his severe allergies. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be just delighted when I share this with him.\nPenny Nelson-Montigny In 1992 my 15 month old daughter had MMR and HIB and one other shot. Developed measles from the shot, strange looking stools, then within 2 weeks had swelling joints out of the blue sky. After taking her to 10 different doctors who said 10 different things (one doctor suggested her toes were swelled because of some powder I must have used on her feet-even though only 5 out of 10 toes were swelled)-we took her to Boston Childrens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and had a diagnoses of Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. The head of rheumatology agreed with me when I said it had to be from the MMR vaccine. The whole waiting room was full of kids the same age with swollen joints after MMR vaccine.\nLola Theodora My bubbly bright daughter after MMR at 18 months became silent, broody n developed full on severe Autism. A friend I met years ago told me her daughter became quadriplegic within 2 days of her MMR\u00c2\u00a0and never recovered. Growing up I only knew in my primary school one child who had mild disability. Today there is a Special Needs Primary School n Secondary school in my area which combined have nearly ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS catering for our neighbourhood districts. I did volunteer work at the secondary school of about Six Hundred students n my heart broke for them n their parents. Some were like zombies with empty expressionless faces just walking around. Could not take it n stopped going.\nDawn Luehrs I got an H1N1 vaccine when 16 weeks pregnant w\/ fraternal twins in 2009. Within days, I had edema. 1 week after vaccination, I went into labor & both membranes ruptured (pPROM). 2 weeks after vaccination, the first twin was born. 6 weeks after vaccination, the second twin was born. Neither of my twins were born mature enough to survive outside my womb. In Nov \u00e2\u20ac\u212212, when my youngest son was 22 months old, 2 children were vaccinated w\/ the flu mist on their way to our Friday morning playdate. After playing for a couple of hours, their mother mentioned it to the rest of the mothers at the playdate. That evening, my son developed a fever. He sat at about 102 temp for 3 days. Slowly, over time on Monday his condition degraded & I drew him a dose of fever reducer, with the intention to give it to him about half an hour before bedtime. 15 minutes before bedtime, his fever spiked suddenly & he had a febrile seizure. The seizure broke his spiking fever & it went back down to 102 or below. Over the next few days, he recovered. His illness was attributed to the playmates shedding live flu virus from the flu mist vaccine.\nCourtney Smellink I myself had a reaction as a teen, developed photosensitivity (in other words an allergic response to sunlight..Urgh) My son had a reaction to his second dtap vaccine, he developed a milk protein allergy from it.\nCandice Smith Only my son is. He will be 5 tomorrow. He is on the autism spectrum. He is very high functioning and smart for his age. A building prodigy. I knew something was off from around 18 months (shortly after receiving his last shots).\n He was not learning new words, had regression with communication gestures, etc. Was a little detached from the world.\n He was diagnosed by Seattle Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital\nTara Last-albrecht My 19 month old has a gene mutation & consequently when she was vaccinated had a reaction to the mmr. She was sick for months on end!\nRolanda Lee Mullis My almost 15 yr old son is vaccine-injured with autism. He was advanced with everything, especially his verbal skills. Once he received his vaccines at 15 mths of MMR, DTaP, Polio, etc, he started having febrile seizures. With every seizure, he went backwards 2 mths. He lost all words, except 3, all potty training, etc. It broke my heart!! He is now diagnosed with epilepsy along with his high functioning autism\/asperger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Granted through years of speech therapy 3 times a week and my mom and I doing it at home 3 times a day, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now verbal. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still times when he gets overexcited and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand him. The last shot he had was against my will and a doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s orders by his dad. That was the beginning of hell for him and my family again! He became extremely violent and defiant to the point of assaulting me and anyone else that was near by him. It got so bad with the bruises at school that I attempted to admit him for inpatient treatment. Please I beg you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate your child! I now have a 2 yr old son, vax-free, that is very healthy!\nBeth Noelle We are! My daughter was hospitalized after half the flu shot years ago when she was 4. She was diagnosed with GuillainBS but thankfully recovered with help of a chiro, homeopath, and naturopath. She also had a reaction at 1 to the MMR where her eyes swelled shut for days and the dr told us it was normal.\nDenise Frampton Son had developed perfectly normal until 2nd year visit (shortly after 2nd birthday) with MMR and Dtap shots. Language stopped and all previously learned skills such as holding a fork and kicking a ball were lost. During routine blood work with a new pediatrician found out son was\/is allergic to egg whites. Daughter had newborn Hib shot and vit. K for fear of being reported to CPS on lack of vaccination i.e. child endangerment. Now has severe food allergies to chicken, milk, eggs (both yolk and whites), and chocolate. Never again will I sign for my children to have these poisons put in their bodies.\nNora Linehan-Daly my two kids were injured, both had severe colic their first year, my son had 25 ear infections one after the other, two surguries for tubes, had to have surgury for aetnoids, my daughter had severe food and medicine allergies was hospitalized and was unconscious so many times had to call 911, i, as an adult have fibromyalgia, digestive issues and allergies to food and medicine after the mmr vaccine, my sister had five miscarriages, has fibromyalgia, lupus, ibs and so much more from the Dtap and mmr and my nephew has autism its been rough for us all.\nAngela Hemphill I have 2 vaccine injured children because I\u00c2\u00a0trusted the doctors to much. One is worse off than the other. I am now a permanent stay at home mom because of it. The doctors refuse to admit they had vaccine reactions, and I\u00c2\u00a0was to naive to contest them. I stopped vaccination completely. My children are considered almost up-to-date on shots, 10 year old and 17 year old, boys.\nNora Huntington-Rodriguez My 1st born had 26 double and single ear infections by the time he was 24 months old. Was on antibiotics all the time. He also suffered severe asthma and was hospitalized sometimes twice a week. My second born would scream at the top of his lungs for hours. Especially at night until he was about 8 months old. He had a temp of 104 and was larthargic.. He would have constant rashes and stomach pain. ONLY when I stopped vaccinating did I see a change in both children.\nBeth Love Nine month old went into respiratory distress and was rushed to ER 5 hours after receiving a flu shot. She was up to date until that point. Was sick for 10 days after. No long term affects as far as I can tell. She is 9 years old now, gate program, 2 grades ahead in reading and writing and on par for every other academic category. I attribute that to a) breastfeeding exclusively for the first year and b) stopping vaccines completely. She is also rarely sick. Gets a mild cold about once a year. No chronic illness, no rashes, eczema, psoriasis, stomach issues, etc. No vaccines since 9 months. I should add, I went on to become a nurse after taking the no-vax stance and continue to stand by it even after my medical education (and because of it).\nCricket Grein My youngest developed Polyarticular Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis at 5 yo. My middle child has hashimotos, and my oldest has crohns. None of them should have ever been vaccinated because they are all at least hetro for c677t mthfr. The youngest is homozygous, different father.\nCynthia Wolff In 1990 my two year old twin boys had their MMR & other vaccines. Shortly thereafter one twin stopped speaking & wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond when spoken to. Communicated by grunting & pointing at what he wanted. Took him back to the pediatrician who said it was nothing to worry about as long as he started speaking again by age four. Also both twins had chronic ear infections requiring daily antibiotics for a year & speech therapy in kindergarten. The one who lost his speech did regain it but has trouble maintaining eye contact since. I had no inkling vaccines could cause such harm & was given nothing but the run around by their doctors.\nBianca Witherspoon-Castillo My son was mildly injured and recovered. Hep A shot gave him a big hard knot on his and some swelling. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember if it was red or not but it took 2 months of hell for it to go away just like the pamphlet said would happen. This was when I had just started waking up. I did not want to continue vaccinating.\nScarlet Howell As a baby I\u00c2\u00a0had a severely high fever reaction to the pertussis vaccine. To the point where the hospital had to put me on ice. I also suffered from staring seizures at 2, and they never figured out why. My mom stopped vaccines and I\u00c2\u00a0still to this day don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive them.\nLynette Kennedy  OMG you poor parents you should NEVER have had to go through any of this with your children\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. I have nothing to report on my 7 kids, nor my 10 grand children or 2 great grand children (born at home) because they are all unvaccinated, healthy and normal without anything, no Sid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, no autism, no allergies etc. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. zilch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nothing. but I am fighting for their future and for all the dead and damaged babies\/kids, I have watched the social engineering take place over the decades and the serious decline in children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health. They have now swapped a week of measles, mumps etc. for life long autism.\nIrena Stepanova I do. My son was born healthy, but he has two disabilities now. Qualified for SSI without so much as a health exam\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 And I still have friends and family who vaccinated their babies because they apparently think something is wrong with me. Well, it is. Was. I trusted doctors\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.\nAnna Maus My daughter had what most healthcare professionals would consider a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mild\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reaction, or as some like to call it, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When you see your child suffering more than they ever have before right after vaccines you know there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing normal about it. The question isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so much can you trust the vaccines, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s can you trust the industry as a whole. And the truth is no, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\nVicki Neal A huge majority of parents who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate came to that opinion after seeing their child have a reaction. I saw that in 1970 when my 2 month old had a reaction almost immediately after her first vax. She is OK now but almost died. No internet back then! I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe kids are still being hurt all these years later. Back then, I was sure that people would have wised up in a short time. Instead they have added so many more shots.\nChantel Pavlick Premature nephew died 2 days after hep vaccine at 6wks old. It was catching him up at full gestation. SIDS is not a cause of death\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nKailee Myers The MMR gave me encephalitis at the age of 15 months and my mom said it was like I was a completely different baby afterwards. I was almost non-verbal when I learned how to talk. I only talked to certain people at certain times. My mom was my teacher in pre-k and I would refuse to talk to her while at school because there were too many people. Later on I figured out that I have Aspergers, Tourette\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and OCD.\nMary Klink My 11 year old son who has Down syndrome was diagnosed with Austism after his MMR at age 6. He was healthy, happy and meeting his milestones. He was talking and just a happy boy until that day. He rapidly regressed and has never been the same. He is now 11.\nVicki Kurup Wooledge I had only 1 vax at a time for my kids. 10 days after my son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MMR at almost age 5, he woke up with garbled speech\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I thought he had a stroke. I took him to every doctor I could find including Mayo Clinic specialists, and no one could help. Various doctors in the bunch asked when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had vaccines but never let on. Finally, after 4 months of no answers & no improvement (& doctors saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing this on purpose!), I took him to a holistic MD who said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seen this kind of thing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.reaction to vaccines. Full detox & after the 2nd session, my son had 85% of his speech back! After the 3rd, he was back to 100%. We are one of the lucky ones who could reverse the damage. No one helps you of your child has a reaction. If he had measles, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have been able to have him treated. It makes no sense.\nRobin Rebrik Stavola Www.hopefromholly.com\nAchillea Mahko My daughter daughter developed OCD, uncontrollable temper and eczema since her mom got all her shots behind my back at age 5. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the lucky ones in that her symptoms are relatively minor, probably due to the age she got her shots at. My friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fraternal twins (boy and girl) went from being way ahead of the developmental curve to full-blown, massively debilitated autism immediately following MMR at around a year old.\nCarreen Engelbrecht Wow, where to start\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I could agree with most of the parents here. Just happy our eyes opened up and we stopped before our eldest was severely injured.\u00c2\u00a0He was ahead on all of his milestones and development, he sat up strongly unattended just before 4 months, but the 4 months shots is where things went really bad very fast, probably just built up from the ones before those. He started regressing with each shot up until 9 months. Eczema, his one eye started pulling inwards slightly, he barely slept (especially at night) up until just past 2 years of age, screaming and severely losing control over his emotions almost 24\/7 (especially at night), \u00e2\u20ac\u0153night terrors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for 3 months straight, speech delay, at the age of 3 years and 3 months, he still struggles to drink from a cup\/glass (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like those muscle reflexes just aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t developed and wont), he still loses control over his emotions which leads to hours and hours of heartbreaking crying sessions, he started walking a bit late, he was constantly so so so very sick, had terrible reflux and colic, a few days after his 4 months shots, he got sick and sicker and sicker and ended up in the hospital almost completely unable to breathe, doctors, nurses and physio therapist all said that they were amazed at how he was still able to breathe at all, he is an extremely fussy eater, still have skin issues related to the chicken pox vaccine (looks like it might be shingles that keeps flaring up), we have also suspected juvenile arthritis, still keeping an eye on it. These are only the ones i can think of now.\n Even i have severe allergies since i can remember and struggle with IBS at times and migraines. Wish we knew the truth earlier or could find an undo button and give our son the best chance in health that he deserves. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the most heartsore burden to live with. When he can talk better and understand better, i want to apologise to him AGAIN for the millionth time. He needs to know we are sorry, WE also need this too. It could have been so much worse if we continued.\n Wish someone told us during my first pregnancy to DO THE RESEARCH AND NEVER STOP! We needed to be awakened sooner.\nAlina Phoenix Both of my girls were nothing but sick from vaccines. When we were listening to the doctor and doing every vaccine, they had eczema, allergies, asthma, bowel issues, ear infections. It was a rare week we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the doctors office. There were creams, antibiotics, steroids, inhalers, nebulizers, a couple trips to the ER, a hospitalization. They were nothing but sick all the time. Then my nephew got encephalitis FROM his vaccines, lost all his language, potty training, developed seizures, and when the symptoms that started THAT DAY never went away, they diagnosed with autism. That is what woke me up. I stopped taking my kids to the doctor, no more vaccines for either one, and began the long and grueling road to recovery. We went all organic in food, cleaning and personal care. We started chiropractic and to heal their guts. For now, they are healthier than they have ever been, although my youngest is showing signs of autoimmunity and we have to take her in for testing. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m autoimmune myself, still trying to figure out which flavor of autoimmunity it is, but it is severe. Vaccines were nothing but poison for my family and caused catastrophic harm.\nJamie Pack Fricke My oldest son was vaccinated to one and a half on a delayed schedule and he stopped talking after he had his MMR. Now he suffers a speech delay and he had severe eczema that went away when we stopped vaccinating him. I was vaccine injured after having the Tdap vaccine after I had my son. A week after having the vaccine and giving birth I was rushed to the emergency room in pain all over my body. They couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out what was going on and it took me over a year and a half until I was finally diagnosed with heavy metal toxicity, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. All autoimmune diseases!!! It was a naturopathic doctor and integrative medicine and a chiropractor that helped me heal my body. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still not 100%, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a whole lot better than I was. I had zero symptoms before I had the vaccine and I never got sick in my life only about every 5 to 6 years and I would just get the 24 hour flu that was it. Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m having to start over and rebuild my whole immune system. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sick all the time and when I get sick it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really bad. My sister in law also got the Tdap vaccine and within two days she was paralyzed from head to toe and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t breathe on her own and was put on life support for 4 months. She was diagdiagnosed with GB syndrome and had to go through a whole year of physical therapy learning how to walk and move her arms again. Today she has to wear braces on her legs to walk, she has severe nerve damage and is in pain all the time. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a couple years older than I am.\nSasha Joy Amara My son at birth. Given Hep B. He wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t latch on to nurse. Cried incessantly and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep at night for a year.\nSafika Erselcuk Mine is. Autism dx as well after last vax was Hep A. Believe he had several reactions previo\nPatricia Gately Anderson Horrible reaction to hep b vaccine the day he was born. Born at 6:21 am, was doing amazing. Latching perfectly and looking at us when we talked to him. Hep b shot was given around 3 pm and he started crying about an hour later, loud painful cry that did not stop for over 10 hours. Would latch then pull away and cry. This I later found out was an encephalitis cry. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know and the nurses looked at each other with concern, but did nothing. I vaccinated on schedule. He did a similar cry at 2 months, but not as bad. Just over a year, I knew something was wrong. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to understand us. Diagnosed with PDD-NOS at 2, and later full autism at 4. I regret not knowing, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m disgusted with those that know but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. And they do know. Stopped vaccines at 17 months, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had 29 by then.\nStef Miharas Vaccine injured son! HIB vaccine full Kawasaki disease! 7 months later MMR atyp\nTammy Jean Martino Oldest son, now 23 yrs, was fully vaccinated, developed chronic ear infections. My girl, now 20 yrs was talking and doing great, her dad fully vaccinated her despite my protests and she went into an autism state about 18 months. My youngest, partially vaccinated, developed facial tics and rapid blinking after the dpt shot around middle school age. The hepatitis b vaccine triggered multiple sclerosis in me within weeks of the initial shot.\nLis Manno My son stopped eating, stopped talking, stopped responding to his name, developed tics, sound\/noise\/touch sensitive from his 15 month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccines. He was ahead of schedule in milestones before these shots. It is on his pediatricians chart.\nDiane Legato I am vaccine injured, went to work overseas had numerous vaccines, chronic inflammation, anxiety, the body pain is getting worse by the day, I have 5 vaccine injured grandchildren, autism, diabetes, asthma, eczema. My husband has been diagnosed with two cancers.\nKim Owens Im vaccine injured. Developed ulcerative colitis shortly after Hep B for grad school. And have gotten sicker and sicker with each passing year. Better believe if I ever have kids I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be vaccinating.\nHalleigh Hill My daughter started having seizures, extreme lethargy after her very first round of vaccines at 4 months within in hours. She was a happy healthy baby before- we did an alternative schedule and did two at a time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my doctor told me her reaction was perfectly normal so we continued every 6 weeks and each time her seizures got worse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we finally stopped at 10 months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she had so many seizures when they finally stopped she was so lethargic she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open her eyes for almost 3 days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she had delayed speech and signed until she was almost 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she is now very healthy and seizure free 3 year old. My son is 1 and has same reaction at 8 weeks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we decided to do one shot at a time. My kids are both MTHFR positive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I find most interesting is my daughter has chronic eczema and when she does pick up a bug she is prone to high fevers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my son on the other has had a cold once and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it.\nJoline Balmforth My son has Vaccine induced Autism, eye problems, eczema, situational Anxiety and so on. Had shots up to 18 months.\nMilla Ezman my daughter regressed into autism and developed allergies, after her 21st month shots. I recovered her with diet, no thanks to doctors. no more vaccines for us, no antibiotics, no SAD diet.\nEva Higdon Charles I will add to my story that once I figured out that vaccines damaged his body and he was old enough to understand, I apologized to him for doing what I thought was keeping him healthy but instead messed up his body. I cried the whole time I explained and apologized. He said he forgave me.\nLindy Keil Schultz I lost my son to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcautism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 within a few days of his first MMR, HIB, DTP,polio shot at age 18 months. He lost what little speech he had left within a week after a tetanus shot at age 3. I did not make the connection until I met Dr. Bradstreet (in 1998) whose son reacted almost identically To MMR. He told me that 99.9% of the kids he saw with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcautism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 were vaccine damaged.\nLeslie Ann Driver My son had an adverse reaction to the pertussis vaccine. Before it he was babbling and starting to roll over. He stopped after the shots and became non verbal except for crying. He is now almost 11 months old and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t roll over, is non verbal, has gross motor delays and has a physical therapist and occupational therapist come each week. They say he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at a 4 month level. He was 4 months when he got these shots. He also has some sensory issues.\nSaraliz Jimz My son kept getting sick they said is was a lung spot. But could not give me anything conclusive even after 3 days in the hospital. Then I was told he needed his adenoids taken out and tubes in his ears. I was referred to a chiropractor who told me to stop vaccinating and treated my son who was better after a week under her care. That was 4 years ago he hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been sick like that again just little cold twice a year. He still has his adenoids and no tubes in his ears. Since we only go to doctor once a year to get forms signed because he hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t needed to go.\nAshley Dore My son died 10 days after his 3rd set of vaccines at 5 months and 5 days old. His death was ruled undetermined after the coroner said he suspected vaccines but the county didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow that as a cause.\nHeather Rose Scott Our son stopped speaking 2 days after his MMR vaccine. He was 2 and now is 4 and still in speech therapy. He is progressing well but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been horrifying. Went from speaking normally to not speaking at all for months then he was impossible to understand.\nJenni Dill Right after my now six year olds shots at 2 yrs, she began having hours long night terrors every night. This lasted two years. She also began showing signs of sensory processing disorder (which is on the autism spectrum), but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what it was until she was 4.

We did find out in the following years he is allergic to foods including soy (Prevnar 13 contains soy protein) and peanuts (not sure which shots speficially contain peanut oil). We also found out that he has the MTHFR gene mutation which means his body can not detox the way other people can.

If a cat never goes outside,\u00c2\u00a0what vaccines\u00c2\u00a0does it need\u00c2\u00a0that are not required by law? Is there any reason not to vaccinate the cat at all except for the\u00c2\u00a0state-mandated rabies shot?\nIMHO this is a very good reading: http:\/\/www.holisticat.com\/vaccinations.html\nNow, here is what I personally do, due to my ***personal situation***:\nBugsy - due to severe vaccine reactions, he will no longer be vaccinated - even though it is the law, his vet will write a letter to the city. His last vaccine (rabies) got him very, very sick.\nI ran a titer test for distemper and the other diseases on the 3-in-one vaccine - he is fine, and will no longer be vaccinated either.\nI would not run a titer, and no longer vaccinate, BUT - Distemper kills, and the virus is carried in clothes, shoes, skin, etc - my live-in petsitter is a vet tech, and I travel about 3 weeks of the month, during which she is in my house, taking care of my kitties. I HAVE to be safe in case she unkwowinly comes in contact with a distemper cat.\nHope and Lucky receive Purevax Rabies vaccine once a year because of the pesitting situation - Hope is a bitey kitty, and the last thing I want is her in quarantene because she bit the pet sitter\nI will not vaccinate either for Distemper. (my vet's protocol is once every 3 years).\nIf I not travelled for a living, I would not vaccinate any of them at this point - I believe they are fine at this point.... But with my personal situation, they require a bit of extra safety - I have to choose the lesser of both evils.\nSelect All Posts By This User\nMy cat has not been vaccinated since he was a kitten. He is 10 years old, indoor only. I don't vaccinate my dogs as adults either, just rabies... IMO vaccines are effective for way longer than the manufacturer says anyway. I probably carry in God-knows-what on my clothes every day just from being out in the world (especially working at a vet clinic) and I tend to believe this is enough to keep the immune response of my healthy animals adequate.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThat's just me, though. For most people I recommend they at least get titers checked. But I don't think we need to vaccinate all the time, especially indoor cats that aren't out there exploring the world of disease.\nSelect All Posts By This User\nI only vaccinated some of my cats as the clinic I used to use required rabies and a combo shot.\u00c2\u00a0 Now I don't vac any of them except the outside cats I trap and the 2 outside cats I have.\u00c2\u00a0 Dog gets rabies only.\u00c2\u00a0 If you are low risk I see no reason to do it.\u00c2\u00a0 I am higher risk cause I have alot of cats but so far it has not been an issue.\u00c2\u00a0 I don't have many people over and they either don't have cats or it's the cats my Mom has that used to live with these guys anyways.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nSelect All Posts By This User\nI give the kitten series, or one set if it's an adult stray. I don't vaccinate after that. There's pretty good evidence that the core vaccines confer immunity for a very long time, possibly for life. I don't have many people over (and those I do have over are non-hysterical friends and family, who wouldn't report it even if something did happen), so I don't worry about bite\/scratch incidents. If I had tame outdoor cats I would keep them current on rabies.\nWhen I did vaccinate more often, the cats always had some chronic health thing going on. My first cat had IBD-type symptoms from about age 6 to about age 13. We stopped vaccinating her at age 10 and within 3 years she didn't have symtoms anymore, and lived to be 21 in fine health. I don't think she would have lived that long if we had kept vaccinating her. My first dog would become very dog aggressive for a few months after every vaccine. It took me a while to catch on to the cause of the aggression, but there was absolutely no doubt after I did figure it out. Anyway, vaccines cause more problems than just acute reactions or cancer.\nI'd recommend basic vaccinations...\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThink of it this way: A starving cat shows up on your doorstep, mewing pitifully and purring the second she's touched. What do you do?\n\u00c2\u00a0\nYeah. You take the cat in, you feed her, you try to find her a home. How could you do anything different? But that starving stray could expose your cats--even if only indirectly--to the common feline diseases. Things can spread through the air, be carried on your hands, survive in shared spaces. Are the risks lower than if your cat went outdoors? Well, sure; lots lower. But they're not zero and I think the risk of exposure is still more important than the minimal risks you take when you vaccinate a cat.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nIt's not just if you take in a stray--what about that new kitten you adopt from the shelter, or the time you have to get your cat-loving friend to take care of your cat while you go and help family out, or the stuff your cat gets exposed to in the vet's waiting room? What if the cat gets lost and spends a week prowling the neighborhood before you manage to scoop her back up again? You can't keep your cat in a perfect bubble.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nTrying to vaccinate against everything might not make sense if the cat is an indoor-only cat, but I wouldn't argue against vaccination, period. Go for the kitten shots at least--basic defenses against major cat diseases. If your cat's indoor-only and you don't foster or board the cat anywhere, that's probably enough.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nNaturally there are exceptions, like Carolina's cat Bugsy, where the risk of vaccination really is higher than the risk of the disease; but usually, it's not. Usually it's safer to vaccinate.\nSelect All Posts By This User\nLocal law requires Rabies.

Because it poses a risk to humans and kills quickly, I always wondered why any state does not require the rabies vaccine. But I do oppose the requirement to put a collar on your cat and never used one. Now I can understand concerns about skin cancer on the right leg, but those are rare and I would not forgo the vaccine unless the cat already had one in the past.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nSelect All Posts By This User\nI have never vaccinated my cat in her life for anything and she is 12 years old. \u00c2\u00a0That was pretty radical thinking back then and I am so grateful that I took the advice of a good friend many years. \u00c2\u00a0Since that time I have spent many years research vaccines and immunology I am even more convinced I made the right decision many years ago. \u00c2\u00a0Me personally, I would never vaccinate my cat.\nQuote:\nOriginally Posted by Willowy\u00c2\u00a0\nI give the kitten series, or one set if it's an adult stray.

Ours no longer receive any vaccinations of any kind. We'd get an exception letter from the vet if needed, but even rabies isn't required in our county. We figure if there's an emergency of some kind, and they need to go to boarding or WHATEVER, we'll get them done then if necessary.\nOur vets get rabies vaccinations. They have titre tests done very two years. So far, none of them have needed boosters. There's no reason to think the immune system of animals functions any differently:\nhttp:\/\/www.dogsadversereactions.com\/vaccines\/FrenchRabiesStudy.html\nQuote:\nA note from Kris Christine: \"This document is very important, because rabies is the one vaccine we are required by law to give our dogs. This study, which I refer to as \"The French Study\" demonstrated that, by challenge, vaccinated dogs were immune to rabies 5 years after innoculation. Under separate cover I had e-mailed you an attachment containing the American Animal Hospital Association's 2003 Canine Vaccine Guidelines -- check out the referenced quote here. Also, check out this link http:\/\/www.rabavert.com\/risk.html for the Populations at Risk for Rabies sheet from Chiron Corporation, manufacturers of the RabAvert rabies vaccines for humans. Their pre-exposure vaccination recommendation for veterinarians, who are at greater risk than the general population for contracting rabies because their profession brings them into physical contact with potentially rabid animals, is for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Primary course. No serologic testing or booster vaccination.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other words, after the initial series of rabies vaccinations, it is not recommended that veterinarians receive further boosters or serological testing. Interestingly, the AAHA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2003 Canine Vaccine Guidelines state on Page 18 that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no indication that the immune system of canine patients functions in any way different from the human immune system. In humans, the epidemiological vigilance associated with vaccination is extremely well-developed and far exceeds similar efforts in animals whether companion or agricultural. This vigilance in humans indicates that immunity induced by vaccination in humans is extremely long lasting and, in most cases, life-long.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This strongly suggests that, like the human rabies vaccine, the canine rabies vaccine may provide life-long immunity as well -- something which could be determined by long-term challenge studies.\"\nThe 1992 French Study is included in the link.\nThe Rabies Challenge Fund is conducting a longer-term challenge study, though the initial goal is simply to \"prove\" that the 3-year is three years:\nhttp:\/\/news.medill.northwestern.edu\/chicago\/news.aspx?id=88487\nThe rabies thing is interesting. There are 2 manufacturers of the vaccine for animals. The EXACT SAME PRODUCT is marked \"one year\" or \"three years,\" depending upon where it is being delivered. Some States require one-year rabies vaccinations - yet the Federal requirement is every three years.\nFrom the Little Big Cat link above:\nQuote:\nDr. Ronald Schultz at the University of Wisconsin is the premier vaccine researcher in the country. He says, that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153canine distemper and adenovirus-2 vaccines both provide good lifelong immunity. These need not be given annually.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says the same about the feline distemper (panleukopenia) vaccine. He believes that a single dose of modified live vaccine given at 10-14 weeks of age is protective for life. Both canine and feline distemper vaccines have been shown to induce immunity for 3-8 years or more. Moreover, all of these are diseases of young animals; most older animals are naturally resistant. Once vaccinated, adult animals are typically fully immune.\nIf you rescue or foster, having a \"quarantine room\" is a necessary precaution. And those rescue\/foster animals shouldn't be introduced to your cats until they've seen a vet, been vaccinated, and several weeks have passed to ensure no illness flares up, even if they do not appear sick.\nSo I see no reason to - what in my opinion - is over-vaccinated your own cats because you rescue or foster.\n","214":"When I was an infant I had whooping cough and was ill for three months. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember it, of course, but I know it was very distressing for my parents. I do remember later trips with my researcher father to his laboratory where he worked on a vaccine for polio and to hospitals where infected children my own age were on iron lungs. That was very distressing.\nI mention this because today people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see such diseases. They aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t frightened about whooping cough or polio. In contrast, 100% of parents in Western Australia had their children vaccinated against polio when the vaccine was made available in 1956. Why? They were scared of their kids getting polio, a terrible disease as reflected in its other name, infantile paralysis.\nBecause today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parents don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have first-hand experience with dangerous infectious diseases they can be misled by myths about the supposed dangers of childhood vaccination: for instance, whooping cough vaccine causes brain damage; the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine causes autism and vaccination causes cot death or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\nThere is no truth to any of these claims. We in Australia have some of the best population data in the world on vaccination outcomes in children and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely clear these myths are just that, myths.\nThe whooping cough myth started in the 1974 in the United Kingdom when some parents claimed that after being vaccinated their children were diagnosed with neurological disorders, what they called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brain damage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.  \nIn fact, it was a coincidence. The first signs a child has a genetic or other brain disorder occur about six months of age. The vaccine is given at two, three and four months, hence the incorrect assumption that the latter caused the former.\nI was a student in the UK at the time. It was disastrous that the medical and epidemiological professions didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond after the kids were shown on television with the claims of vaccine caused brain injury. The government paid compensation, reinforcing the false vaccination-brain damage association. \nAs a result, the rate of vaccination dropped from 81% to 31%, triggering the most horrendous epidemic of whooping cough. In one year, 21 children died and thousands were hospitalised with severe pneumonia and, sadly, brain damage from the infection.\nThe fear of the disease influenced parents to vaccinate again and immunisation rates went back up and disease incidence went down. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tragedy that it took an epidemic to prove that vaccination is protective. Several major studies also demonstrated clearly that whooping cough vaccines were protective against brain damage and not causing it.\nThe misguided belief that vaccination causes SIDS is also a case of myth by coincidence. The peak age of SIDS is four months, following vaccinations given from two to four months. The timing of the two events is associated in people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minds, despite study after study showing no connection. \nInstead, the research shows SIDS is linked strongly to lying babies on their face or having their head covered with bedding or toys. Other risk factors include smoking, not breastfeeding, overcrowding and over-heating.\nThe myth that the MMR vaccine causes autism is particularly naughty. It was started in 1998 by a scientist who published the claim in a widely-reported paper in The Lancet. \nAgain, vaccination rates fell precipitously and outbreaks of measles, mumps and rubella occurred. It was revealed the scientist had undeclared conflicts of interest and had engaged in scientific misconduct. The paper was retracted but the damage was done.\nSuch myths demonstrate why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely crucial that medical researchers obtain solid laboratory data about new and combination vaccines, test them rigorously and obtain very good surveillance and monitoring data. The public must have confidence that the research is done and done well.\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the Australian Academy of Science has just released a booklet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Science of Immunisation: Questions and Answers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which explains the basics of vaccination and debunks common myths about vaccines and vaccination. It draws on expertise from a broad sector of the Australian science community, from virology and immunology to my field of epidemiology. \nI urge all Australians to get the truth about the myths. Vaccination is a wonderful development in public health. It has prevented enormous suffering and millions of deaths worldwide. The benefits of vaccination outweigh the very small risk of unwanted side effects. Just ask the parents of 1956.\n","215":"Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the movie, VAXXED.

The evidence is that this has been done in order to protect the current vaccine program and preserve the status quo, which is ever rising rates of autism and all sorts of other childhood disorders. The focus of this film is on autism, but it could instead be on asthma, ADD, anaphylaxis, diabetes, other behavioral and learning disabilities in children. These have all increased severely in the past 25 years.\n Yes, do see the movie, and act. Act to protect the health of your children and your grandchildren. We need a reassessment of vaccine safety. The evidence is that our current program is not safe. Millions of parents in the US are asking their pediatricians if immunizations\u00c2\u00a0are safe, and their pediatricians are reassuring them based on fraudulent data.\u00c2\u00a0 Vaccines are not the problem; the problem is lack of good science, with evidence of fraud at the highest levels.\u00c2\u00a0 If we are to restore the trust of our people in vaccine safety, good science must be done, with rigor and transparency.\n","216":"Long a cost-effective stalwart in the public health armament, vaccines have become a target for misinformation that has undermined immunization efforts in parts of the U.S., U.K. and elsewhere, contributing to dangerous and potentially lethal disease outbreaks of measles, polio and more.

Why are databases like VAERS and the VSD simply stagnant repositories, rather than sources of actionable scientific facts? Why are vaccine injury victims left to struggle the rest of their lives while more and more infants and adults needlessly join their ranks?\nAt this time ASD research is at an interesting cross-roads key areas of research are focused on immune dysfunction, gastrointestinal disorders, neuroinflammation and epilepsy. As well in immune signalling pathways.\nAt the same time our understandings of how varying systems within the ASD child interact is also changing \u00e2\u20ac\u201d there is clear crosstalk between the immune system and neurology \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but which drives which ?\nFor instance in ASD children with GI dysfunction research suggests that the child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s microbiome drives neurology ie gut dysbiosis has a clear outcome on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcregression\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in ASD.

We should also not confine ourselves simply to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoutcome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of ASD in children but also keep in mind the varying and serious co-morbid diseases and complications in this cohort of children.\nOne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention needs to be bought to two recent studies surrounding co-morbid conditions in ASD .\nThe first by Isaac Kohane et al Center for Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School \u00e2\u20ac\u201c http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033224\nand the second paper found here by Mu-Hong Chen Department of Psychiatry, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan found here http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1750946712001018\nDo viruses and bacteria play a part in ASD trajectory as well as etiology I think that is becoming clearer each day, there are some elegant animal models that show a link to prenatal infection and the development of aspects of aberrant neurological outcomes in ASD, schizophrenia and depression.\nThe best idea this forum for researchers around the world Congratulations\n","217":"For more than three years, Tanya Gottesburen refused to have her son Robert vaccinated. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like what she read about the ingredients in vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c things like mercury, aluminum and bovine serum that she found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really disturbing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Many of her stay-at-home mum friends on the affluent Westside of Los Angeles felt the same way.\nWhen Robert was an infant, Tanya didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think his immune system could handle what the doctors wanted to inject into him. She preferred to keep breast-feeding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until he was almost two and a half \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and give him solid food that was organic and healthy.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I received 12 vaccines when I was a kid, now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to 36,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gottesburen said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I could not see myself doing that to him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThen came the recent measles outbreak at Disneyland, 45 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 drive from Gottesburen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house, and an avalanche of media coverage featuring complaints from doctors that the anti-vaccination movement has single-handedly revived an entirely preventable disease.\nGottesburen felt torn, and fearful. Her family had been at Disneyland in November, three weeks before the outbreak, and now she imagined how if the timing had been different, Robert might have ended up sick in hospital. For the past two weeks, she has worried about what he might pick up at the preschool he has just started attending. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where those other kids have been,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if they were at Disneyland when the outbreak happened. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if they went to other countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nShe also worried about the baby she is due to deliver in a few weeks. What if Robert got measles and it affected her newborn? \nStill, though, she did not know what to do. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like feeling bullied into vaccinating her child. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like parents who shun anti-vaccination advocates and refuse to have unvaccinated children over to their house for playdates. The turning point came when she heard a radio interview with Jay Gordon, a Los Angeles pediatrician known to be sympathetic to vaccine-resistant parents. \nDr Gordon, whose patients include the vocal anti-vaccination celebrity Jenny McCarthy, has been critical of some ingredients in common vaccines and has offered anecdotal evidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c refuted by peer-reviewed studies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. On this occasion, however, Dr Gordon said unequivocally that MMR was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a dangerous vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He thought giving it at 12 months, the standard time, was too early, but otherwise he had no objection.\nThree hours later, Gottesburen took her son to the doctor and had him inoculated. \nParents in affluent communities all over California have been going through similar agonies since the news broke about the Disneyland outbreak. While the spread of the disease has been relatively modest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fewer than 100 cases in five US states, plus one case in Mexico \u00e2\u20ac\u201c media coverage has been intense, almost all of it shining a spotlight on the anti-vaccination movement and the threat it has posed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a level of inoculation high enough to protect even the most vulnerable, including newborns, the elderly and those with auto-immune conditions.\nCalifornia is a lightning rod for such debate, because it has unusually lax rules permitting parents to opt out of vaccination for non-specific personal beliefs. It also has a relatively high population of affluent, protective parents who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to take what they are told on trust and have tapped into an online community of doubters, critics and conspiracy theorists who believe the pharmaceutical industry and the medical establishment are concealing the truth about vaccines.\nThe degree of doubt varies widely, from people like Jay Gordon who believe the MMR vaccine should be delayed until the age of 3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something public-health advocates say has needlessly caused sickness in 1-to-3-year-olds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to much more controversial figures like Joseph Mercola, an osteopath from rural Illinois who mistrusts sunscreen and microwave ovens as well as vaccinations, or Mike Adams, a writer for Natural News who dismisses vaccines as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153medical child abuse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nAnti-vaccination suits part of the political left, which has long been suspicious of the lobbying power of the pharmaceutical industry and its influence on government regulators, and also the fringe political right, which has at different times seen vaccination, fluoridisation and other public-health initiatives as attempts by big government to impose tyrannical limits on personal freedom.\nEveryone, however, seem to view the Disneyland outbreak as an important event \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a reason either to rethink some of the doubts they have about vaccination, or to dig in and resist even harder. \nCertainly, the medical community has been urging wavering parents to get their children vaccinated, and not just in the media. Parents at the main public high school in Santa Monica, a community with a strong anti-vaccination streak, received a note from the school nurse this weekend warning them that unimmunised students risked being banned from school for up to 21 days, the incubation period for measles. Some schools in Orange County, nearer Disneyland, have already issued such orders to unimmunised children.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Exposure to unimmunized children poses a serious health risk to these students whose immune systems are unable to protect them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the note from Santa Monica High School went on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The more district and community members who are immunised, the safer the environment is for our school community and in particular to these fragile children.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nMany previously outspoken parents have gone suddenly quiet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including in response to comment for this story. The Westside Waldorf school, which has only a 20% rate of measles immunisation among its students, did not respond to an invitation to comment. Neither did a parent representative at PS1, a private school in Santa Monica with a 63% measles immunisation rate. Herd immunity kicks in at around 95%.\nThe more radical voices refused to be silenced, however. Mike Adams of Natural News penned a furious piece titled: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Afraid of the Disneyland measles outbreak? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fooled by Mickey Mouse science.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He urged parents to read the small print on the vaccine insert, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rather than just blindly injecting your child with toxic chemicals the same way all the obedient sheeple [sic] do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nOne Los Angeles parent vehemently opposed to vaccination, Michelle Henney, said she hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even been aware of the Disneyland outbreak because she refused on principle to follow the mainstream news media. But she was in no doubt, even without reading the coverage, that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they have skewed the facts in favor of trying to sell people more pharmaceuticals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This whole vaccination thing is just a scam to steal your money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Henney said.\nTwo of her three children went to the Calvary Christian School in Pacific Palisades (which had a 75% MMR immunisation rate last year). A third went to public school, but was spared the risk of being sent home in the event of an outbreak because Henney found a doctor willing to falsify her immunisation records. \nNone ever went to a pediatrician. Henney relied instead on natural medicines, a chiropractor and acupuncture. She actively sought to expose her daughter to chicken pox, preferring what she called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural immunisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by contracting the disease to a vaccine.\nHenney said she did not reject the concept behind all vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she understood the appeal of eradicating formerly common childhood diseases like measles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but felt they were too dangerous because of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toxins\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like formaldehyde, mercury and aluminum (ingredients that the scientific community has deemed to be safe).\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccines are a great idea,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Henney said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but they are poisoning us, adding things that kick in later in life so they can sell us more drugs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n","218":"Every time I read a headline about the measles epidemic in Wales I flinch with shame. This is because I used to be one of those people who refused to have their child vaccinated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for anything. My daughter was born in a London hospital in September 2011, and every time the doctors, the health visitors and the nurses at the weighing clinic tried to give her the routine jabs, I put her back in her pram and wheeled her away.\nThe NHS schedule of inoculations felt so over the top, full of diseases I'd last heard mention of in gloomy Victorian novels. Injections at two, three, four, 12 and 13 months, for diphtheria, tetanus, tuberculosis, pertussis, polio \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all these archaic names, not things that you actually think your child is going to catch. OK, so we lived in Hackney, with a diverse immigrant population, sometimes arriving from countries where those diseases are still active. In fact, our borough was one of the few places in Europe where tuberculosis was actually making a comeback. But not in my house \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I mean, we had a washing machine and a fridge full of organic vegetables and surely, you know, only weak and sickly people could catch it?\nI wasn't a completely barefoot do-gooding type by any stretch of the imagination, but I breastfed, and read a lot of alternative health forums online that left me convinced we had become too over-protective. It was good for children to catch diseases naturally and fight them off by themselves. My baby would build up a strong immune system all of her own, not have it interfered with by some paranoid government programme that seemed to involve pumping metals into her blood.\nThat was, until she caught pertussis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which turns out to mean whooping cough. Which turns out to mean months of pain. It is a highly contagious disease that comes in stages, but that horrible, hacking cough that kept her up all night went on for so many weeks that she was prescribed an inhaler. She was past her first birthday, so unlikely to die of it, like newborns can, but it's disgusting to watch your child needlessly suffer like that. My parents had to come to help us, and then we grownups all succumbed to the revolting condition too. Of course, having wanted to avoid filling her body with chemicals, I ended up giving her all the medicines I could find.\nAnd yet I still wondered about that list of things that I would now, I suppose, have to surrender to and immunise my child against. Polio, for one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a couple of my parents' pensioner friends still carry the limp left by their childhood polio, but none of my friends do, because it isn't around any more. And diphtheria \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what was that, even? I knew it had killed one of Queen Victoria's daughters, but that wasn't our reality.\nThe reason it wasn't our reality was, of course, due to a continuous programme of immunisation. Duh. Diphtheria is a disease that still kills one in five infants it meets, even if they get treatment, their necks swelling up until they can no longer breathe. I have now seen a picture of a child whose neck was ravaged by diphtheria, bloated like a\u00c2\u00a0foie gras goose about to burst. I wish\u00c2\u00a0I\u00c2\u00a0could unsee it.\nMeningitis, though, I did know about. By the age of 17, I had lost two school friends to it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I went to their funerals. A\u00c2\u00a0third friend had survived. Those were\u00c2\u00a0three separate outbreaks in\u00c2\u00a0York\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0the 1980s and 1990s.\nWriting this now, I can't even give a decent answer as to why I didn't at least get my daughter vaccinated against meningitis C (the B vaccine has not been licensed yet). To think that in my own lifetime \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I'm only in my mid-30s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c diseases that used to kill my friends have been effectively suppressed. My daughter won't have to go to her friends' funerals like I did \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as long as we keep giving them the jabs. And yet some of us are still coasting on herd immunity provided by other children, which is no longer enough, because of the growing number of people like me.\nWhen it came to it, my mother still had to take my daughter for the injections, as I was too squeamish. The fact is, I still have a hunch that puts me off vaccinations, a hunch that I can't explain. I just feel funny about them. But I feel even funnier about the thought of mine or anyone else's kid dying of measles in this country in 2013, like Roald Dahl's daughter Olivia did in 1962. \"Got to hospital,\" he wrote in his diary. \"Walked in. Two doctors advanced on me from waiting room. How is she? I'm afraid it's too late.\"\n","219":"Donald Trump blames a link to vaccines for causing autism. But he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame vaccines for his own apparent memory problem.\nThe Republican presidential frontrunner told the GOP debate on Wednesday about one particular case. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People that work for me, just the other day, two years old, beautiful child went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later, got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nWhatever the cause of the ailment, it was a sad story. But not, it seems, a new story. In April 2012 the tycoon-turned reality TV star told a very similar tale to Fox News.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It happened to somebody that worked for me recently. I mean, they had this beautiful child, not a problem in the world, and all of the sudden they go in and they get this monster shot ... they pump this in to this little body and then all of the sudden the child is different a month later.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \nWas Trump referring to two different cases, or was he recycling the same story and freshening it up with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just the other day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reference? His campaign did not respond to a Guardian query on Thursday.\nThe apparent blurring of time, according to political and medical experts, fit a pattern of smudging facts about vaccinations.\nTrump, they said, peddled a false theory which put children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health at risk. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What Trump said is not just wrong, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dangerous because if people take him seriously and delay vaccines for their children the children could get sick,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College and author of The Politics of Autism: Navigating the Contested Spectrum. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of what Trump says is annoying but this is serious. Vaccines are just about the only cause of autism that scientists have ruled out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nMatt Zahn, medical director of epidemiology and assessment for the Orange County Health Care Agency, which battled a measles outbreak at Disneyland earlier this year, lamented the candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not helpful. It does give the impression that the water is muddy when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not at all. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing that this issue has been raised again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nA 1998 Lancet report by researcher Andrew Wakefield linked vaccines to autism, triggering a decade-long, anguished debate on both sides of the Atlantic until the report was discredited and retracted, and Wakefield disgraced. \nOfficial medical advice says vaccines are safe, but some parents still worry that vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially the standard measles, mumps and rubella jab \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can overload a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system.\nTwo other GOP candidates, Ben Carson and Rand Paul, both physicians, partially challenged Trump on the stage at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, which hosted the debate.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact of the matter is, we have extremely well-documented proof that there is no autism associated with vaccinations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Carson. But he agreed with the billionaire that doctors were probably giving too many shots in too short a period of time.\nPaul took the same position: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m all for vaccines, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also for freedom. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also a little concerned about how they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re bunched up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), among other institutions, warns against skipping or delaying vaccinations, saying the schedule is safe. Zahn agrees. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to make sure that the message is consistent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nPitney, a former Republican operative, said Trump appeared to be sincere since he aired his views long before running for the White House. He faulted Carson and Paul for ducking an opportunity to nail the myth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They had an opportunity to show real courage by taking him on strongly and directly and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I think they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to take on this very vocal group of people who believe in vaccine theory.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nDespite assurances from the CDC and research in journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders debunking any link between autism and vaccines, a movement opposed to existing vaccine protocols has taken root in the US.\nHigh-profile figures include the actor Jenny McCarthy and an Orange County doctor, Bob Sears, who authored The Vaccine Book: Making the Right Decision for Your Child.\nWealthy parents have proved especially receptive to the message that health authorities are in the pocket of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big pharma\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, including some environmentalists and liberal Democrats, such as Robert Kennedy Jr.\nIn California more than 150 schools have exemption rates of 8% or higher for at least one vaccine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all in high income areas, according to an Los Angeles Times study last year. \nMeasles vaccines are said to be 99% effective but when a significant minority of children are not vaccinated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breaks down.\nThe outbreak of measles which spread after an unvaccinated person visited Disneyland infected more than 150 people in the US and Mexico. Most were in California.\nThe ensuing outcry prompted the state in June to pass one of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strictest vaccination regimes: nearly all public schoolchildren must be vaccinated against diseases including measles and whooping cough, with exemptions only for children with serious health issues. Other unvaccinated children must be home schooled.\nTrump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate comments will have cheered the small, highly motivated coalition of parents groups which wants to repeal the law.\nDr Sears, the controversial vaccine protocol skeptic, has detailed on his Facebook page how parents can fight it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Try to get every Legislator who voted yes to lose his or her next election. And join every protest and meeting you can to make your voices heard.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nPitney said one hostile critic on Amazon urged people to burn his book The Politics of Autism. Misguided progressives and conservatives embraced conspiracy theories about vaccinations, he said, but in this race for the White House it was an issue only among Republican candidates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It joins with anti-government sentiment on the Republican side.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n","220":"There have been a number of outbreaks of disease - including one at Disneyland - as a result of children not being properly vaccinated.\u00c2\u00a0\nAt the same time, there is exhaustive scientific research that concludes that vaccines such as the MMR (Measles, Mumps, & Rubella) have no association with autism.\nDespite this, a new survey suggests that one in three supporters of Donald Trump believe vaccines do indeed cause autism. (Around one in five supporters of Hillary Clinton believe\u00c2\u00a0the same.)\nThe findings are based on a survey conducted by The Economist\/YouGov, which surveyed 1,376 US\u00c2\u00a0adults between December 17-20 and asked them a number of questions.\nOne reason for the high percentage of Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters holding this erroneous opinion, may be the man himself.\nMr Trump has repeatedly said he believes there is a link between vaccines and autism in children.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I've seen people where they have a perfectly healthy child, and they go for the vaccinations, and a month later the child is no longer healthy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Trump told Fox News in 2012.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It happened to somebody that worked for me recently.

And I strongly believe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nMr Trump was asked about this incident during a Republican primary debate in September 2015, and he repeated the claim. Indeed, he said the vaccines\u00c2\u00a0were causing an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153autism epidemic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153People that work for me, just the other day, two years old, beautiful child went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later, got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.\nAt one campaign stop, Mr Trump spoke with leading proponents of the discredited link between vaccines and autism, including disbarred British doctor Andrew Wakefield, at a fundraiser in Florida.\nScienceMag said Trump chatted with a group of donors that included four anti-vaccine activists for 45 minutes, according to accounts of the meeting, and promised to watch Vaxxed, an anti-vaccine documentary produced by Mr Wakefield.\nMr Wakefield, who is now believed to live in Austin, Texas, was the lead author of a 1998 paper published in The Lancet which claimed to show a link between children who were given the MMR with autism and bowel disease.\nNo other scientists were able to reproduce his results. Following an official inquiry, the British General Medical Council concluded that Mr Wakefield acted dishonestly and irresponsibly, and even performed unnecessary invasive medical procedures such as colonoscopies.\nThe Lancet eventually retracted the paper and Mr Wakefield was struck from the UK medical register.\nExperts say the danger of not getting vaccinated is all too clear.\nIn December 2014 dozens of people caught Measles after visiting California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Disneyland. The outbreak, one of the worst in the last 15 years, eventually spread to Colorado, Oregon, Utah, Washington state and Mexico.\nObservers pointed out that while California law requires children to get vaccinations for measles, mumps and rubella, a loophole allows parents to opt out via a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal belief waiver\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if they think there is a link between vaccines and autism.\nReports said\u00c2\u00a0that of the 34 patients caught up in the initial outbreak, only five were believed to be fully vaccinated.\n","221":"Donald Trump has expressed concern about a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous increase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in autism rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an argument commonly made by anti-vaccine campaigners, but disputed by autism experts.\nAt a White House meeting, the President asked the principal of a special education centre in Virginia whether she had seen an increase in autism cases at her school.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on with autism? When you look at the tremendous increase, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such an incredible\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really horrible thing to watch, the tremendous amount of increase.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.\nJane Quenneville, the principal, replied that one in 66 children are diagnosed with autism, figures in line with the most recent government report on the matter.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gotta be even lower than that, which is just amazing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mr Trump, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well, maybe we can do something\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nMr Trump has previously indicated he believes vaccines can cause autism. He tweeted\u00c2\u00a0in 2014: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes - AUTISM. Many such cases!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHowever there is exhaustive scientific research that concludes that vaccines such as the MMR \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for measles, mumps, and rubella \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have no association with autism.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported last March that about one in 68 school-aged children have autism or related disorders \u00e2\u20ac\u201d about the same as in 2014.\nWhile the rate does appear to have increased since the year 2000, when CDC figures show around one in 150 children had the disorder, experts say this is to do with better awareness of the disease and changes in the way it is diagnosed.\nScience writer Steve Silberman told  New York Magazine the President was wrong to emphasise how \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153horrible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the rise was.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some people claim that there are some environmental factors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably, not vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that may be contributing to a small increase. But the consensus is that there has been no huge, startling, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchorrible,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as Trump said, increase in autism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.\nMr Silberman, whose book about autism Neurotribes won the prestigious Samuel Johnson prize for best nonfiction writing, said studies had shown older parents were more likely to have children with autism.\nSocial trends of waiting later to have\u00c2\u00a0children could therefore have contributed to a slight rise in autism cases, he said, as well as increased public awareness of the condition.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The CDC estimate has been flat for a couple of years, just as they expected it to be, because the major source of the increase that started in the 1990s was broadened diagnostic criteria and much more public awareness of what autism looks like,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Silberman told the magazine.\nMr Trump was speaking with parents and teachers alongside new education secretary Betsy DeVos.\nThe MMR vaccine has been available in the US since 1963, and the country believed it had eliminated measles more than a decade ago, meaning any cases in the country were imported from abroad and there was no danger of domestic transmission.\u00c2\u00a0\nBut in 1998 the British doctor Andrew Wakefield published a controversial and since-discredited study in The Lancet, which purported to show a link between the MMR jab and autism in children.\nThe article was retracted and Dr\u00c2\u00a0Wakefield struck off, but it nonetheless gave a boost to the burgeoning anti-vaccination movement.\nA measles outbreak at Disneyland two years ago was said to be as a result of children not being properly vaccinated.\nLast month, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has supported the theory that vaccines cause autism, said Mr Trump had planned to appoint him as a chair of a new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvaccine safety\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 commission.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153President-elect Trump...\u00c2\u00a0asked me to chair a commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153President-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies, and he has questions about it. He says his opinion doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter, but the science does matter, and we ought to be reading the science, and we ought to be debating the science.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153And that everybody ought to be able to be assured that the vaccines that we have \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very pro-vaccine, as am I \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re as safe as they possibly can be.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nA survey has suggested that one in three Trump supporters believe vaccines do cause autism.\n","222":"Parents who choose not to vaccinate their children and protect them with vaccine exemption forms are often chastised and stereotyped for putting their own kids at risk. But what is even stranger than this assault on individual freedom and informed choice, is that these concerned parents are attacked for putting vaccinated children at risk.\nThese attacks are based on the theory of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This hypothesis was plucked out of an old college textbook. It states that the more people are immune to an infectious agent, the less likely an immune-compromised individual is to come in contact with it. In other words herd immunity serves as a human shield \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a type of immunity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at-risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd individuals. But remember, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a hypothesis.\nWhen outbreaks arise among children, health officials are quick to state that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to a breakdown in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcherd immunity.\u00e2\u20ac\u02dc Doctors parrot it too, without even looking at the research. They say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening more often nationwide as states make it easier for parents to opt out of vaccinations.\nLike argumentative apes, pro-vaccine parents and their physicians start pounding their chest in favor of such statements. They use them to attack anti-vaccine parents, accusing them of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153putting vaccinated kids at risk due to a breakdown in herd immunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThis is fuzzy logic. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borderline stupid.\nAfter all, if vaccines truly worked, then why would vaccinated kids be at risk?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Plus, the spread of infection isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t limited to coming into contact with another person! You can get sick without ever seeing another individual. Therefore, herd immunity is nothing more than a silly catch-phrase used to scare and bully parents into vaccinating their kids. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall for it parents, keep using the vaccine exemption forms to legally avoid them.\nParents Should Question Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness by Using Vaccine Exemption\nInstead of using an unproven hypothesis to question parents who have opted out, pro-vaccine parents should be questioning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. With dozens of vaccines being forced on the public, some healthy skepticism could go a long way toward raising a vibrantly healthy child.\nMy background as a medicinal chemist taught me to rely on proven research. I learned to be less sensitive to emotional arguments and more sensitive to facts supported by reproducibility. This is one of the main principles of the scientific method. It refers to the ability of a test or experiment to be accurately reproduced. As a parent, I have a responsibility to use my training to make decisions for my family. Especially when it comes to potentially dangerous vaccinations.\nIn my own research, I have uncovered facts that every parent should be aware of. Here are three primary reasons why I have not and will not vaccinate my own children and why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve used vaccine exemption forms\n for public school and more:\nReason #1: Vaccination Does Not Always Mean \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Immunization\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nVaccines are purported to work by triggering the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural immunity. By injecting weak or dead infectious agents through our skin, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s believed that the body will create the appropriate immune defense. They are even called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immunizations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAnd while this idea is over two hundred years old, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not nearly as effective as the pharmaceutical companies, doctors and government agencies want you to believe.\nAt best, vaccines boost our defenses only temporarily. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because your immune system is programmed to recognize and attack invaders that come through the biological \u00e2\u20ac\u0153front door.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That would be your nose, mouth and eyes. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work properly when we shove infection into our body with a needle.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) underscored this fact in their report titled, Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. They wrote that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Children under two years of age do not consistently develop immunity following vaccination.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Therefore, vaccines can fly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153below the radar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of our immune system.\nNot only does this weaken the immune system, it renders many vaccines ineffective.\nAnd history proves this to be the case\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n[RELATED: Nature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Immune Booster is Potent Antibiotic. See the facts here.]\nThe Polio Vaccine\nPolio is the most feared childhood illness. It has caused paralysis and death for much of human history. The world experienced a dramatic increase in polio around 1910. Epidemics became regular events. They were the driving force behind a great race toward the development of a polio vaccine. The vaccine was developed in 1953 and an oral version came soon after.\nBut the vaccines came too late. Thanks to better hygiene, sanitation and nutrition, the rates of polio infection had already plummeted as documented in my book, Over-The-Counter Natural Cures. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing, because both forms were a total failure. In fact, instead of preventing polio\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they actually caused it!\nMedical journals around the world have exposed this outcome. The Medical Journal of Australia discovered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the relation of prophylactic inoculations [polio vaccines] to the onset of poliomyelitis [polio]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as far back as 1951.\nAnd the trend has continued\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nIn a 2007 article, entitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nigeria Fights Rare Vaccine-Derived Polio Outbreak,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters showed how the vaccine itself ignited outbreaks of polio in Nigeria, Chad and Angola.\nAnd according to The Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, the polio vaccine program launched by Bill Gates paralyzed 47,500 children in 2011 alone. And those injured by the vaccine died at twice the rate of those infected by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wild\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd polio!\nWhooping Cough\nThe same scenario was repeated in the case of the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine. Between 1900 and 1935, mortality rates due to whooping cough dropped by 79 percent in the United States. Yet, the vaccine (DTP and DTaP) wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t introduced until 1940.\nToday, those who have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immunized\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are the most susceptible to whooping cough.\nResearchers with the CDC publicly stated in 2002 that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the number of infants dying from whooping cough is rising, despite record high vaccination levels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In 2009, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recognized the trend too. In the article titled, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whooping Cough Vaccine not as Powerful as Thought,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the publication highlighted a recent cluster of 18 whooping cough-infected students. Seventeen of those students \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 95% of those infected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had been immunized with five doses of DTaP vaccine.\nMeasles, Mumps, Rubella\nThe measles vaccine is no different. In 1957, the MMR shot became widely used in an effort to eradicate measles, mumps, and rubella. The The CDC insisted that it would eliminate mumps in the United States by the year 2010.\nBut rather than preventing mumps and measles, the vaccine has actually caused widespread epidemics. Outbreaks have become the norm. And those who have suffered the most were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccinated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nBetween 1983 and 1990, there was a 423% increase in measles cases among vaccinated individuals. Then in 2006, the largest mumps outbreak in twenty years occurred. Among those infected, 63% were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immunized,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as shown by Neil Miller in Vaccines: Are They Safe and Effective? Others found similar results.\nIn The Journal of Infectious Diseases, scientists from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine wrote, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccine failure accounted for a sustained mumps outbreak in a highly vaccinated population.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIn his book, How to Raise a Healthy Child In Spite of Your Doctor, the late Dr. Robert Mendlesohn, MD showed that vaccinated individuals are 14 times more likely to contract mumps than unvaccinated.\nThese stunning vaccine failures led the Iowa Department of Public Health to conclude that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Our most important public health tool against this disease\u00e2\u20ac\u201d2 doses of MMR vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis not providing the necessary levels of protection to control mumps in the U.S. population.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nEven the Mayo Clinic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a bastion of mainstream medicine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c states that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccine failure has become increasingly apparent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nFlu Vaccine Failure\nThe flu vaccine has proven just as worthless\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nIn 2007, the CDC reported that it had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no or low effectiveness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against influenza or influenza-like illnesses. The data showed that the flu vaccine protected no more than 14% of those who received it. And this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t some fluke. The vaccine is rarely any more effective than that.\nEven The New York Times reports that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The influenza vaccine, which has been strongly recommended for people over 65 for more than four decades, is losing its reputation as an effective way to ward off the virus.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nDoctors who do their homework understand that vaccines are ineffective. Dr. Ira Goodman MD, FACS, ABHIM, a surgeon from Loyola Medical School is one of them. Through email correspondence, he told me he is against vaccines simply because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe failure of vaccines has finally gone mainstream. But instead of admitting that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer protection, health officials and the pharmaceutical companies are pushing for MORE vaccines as the solution. When you consider the number of outright toxins contained in these experimental concoctions, the implications are chilling.\nReason #2 Vaccines Expose Kids to Toxins\nAccording to fact sheets put out by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), vaccines are brimming with toxins. These include dozens of chemicals, heavy metals and allergens. They also include numerous objectionable ingredients, such as monkey kidney cells and aborted fetal tissue.\nFormaldehyde is just one of many chemicals found in vaccines. And according to the FDA, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Excessive exposure to formaldehyde may cause cancer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another ingredient in the cocktail is a chemical known as 2-phenoxyethanol. This comes with an FDA warning which states that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It can depress the central nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration in infants.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAnd that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the tip of the iceberg\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nIn addition to mercury and aluminum, many vaccines are also spiked with antibiotics like neomycin, polymyxin B, streptomycin and gentamicin. These drugs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even approved for uninfected children!\nDespite this emerging toxic threat, Parenting Magazine and Dr. Paul Offit stated that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In theory, healthy infants could safely get up to 100,000 vaccines at once.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Are you kidding me? He won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be testing that theory on my children. I wonder if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willing to stab himself that many times to prove it?\nI queried numerous physicians via email and phone to find out if they shared Dr. Offit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ideas. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Dr. Suzanne Humphries, MD was adamant that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaccines put children at risk for a form of kidney disease called nephrotic syndrome. This can be caused by a common ingredient \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Bovine Serum Albumin. Doctors just give children steroids to suppress the symptoms, never knowing what the cause was.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIf parents need further proof of toxicity, they can read vaccine package inserts. The insert for the DPT vaccine from Sanofi Pasteur warns that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A review by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found evidence for a causal relation between tetanus toxoid and both brachial neuritis and Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome [pain and loss of nerve and motor function].\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Makers of the Tripedia vaccine for DTaP state that certain outcomes are so frequent that they had to list them. These reactions include:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Anaphylactic reaction\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Cellulitis (a bacterial skin infection)\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Autism\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Convulsion\/Seizures\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Brain dysfunction\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Low muscle tone and strength\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Nerve damage\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Hyperventilation\/apnea\nThese are some damn good reasons to use vaccine exemption forms.\nVaccine supporters will insist that the benefits outweigh these toxicity risks. But that would only be true if vaccination was the only road to immunization.\nReason #3 Kids Can Build Immunity Naturally\nWe are all at risk from various \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biological nasties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Invisible threats are everywhere\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6A single gram of feces can contain more than 10 million viruses, 1 million bacteria, 1,000 parasite cysts and 100 parasite eggs.\nThe goal is to minimize risk by increasing our immunity, naturally. In Over-The-Counter Natural Cures, I showed how innate and adaptive immunity act as our God-given protection from biological nasties.\nBut, you have to support these Gatekeepers of health with proper nutrition, hygiene, sanitation and natural medicine like andrographis. Just as hand washing saved millions from infant mortality in a hospital setting, healthy habits minimize exposure and boost our natural defenses. The science supporting this won the Nobel Prize in 2011!\nBruce Beutler and Jules Hoffmann discovered that we are hard-wired with special receptors that recognize foreign invaders and activate our immune response. Ralph Steinman then found that special cells of the immune system possess the unique capacity to activate the immune response, which clears biological nasties from the body. And all of this occurs without vaccination!\n[RELATED: Nature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Immune Booster is Potent Antibiotic. See the facts here.]\nDecline in Disease Not Caused by Vaccination\nFurther research has shown that the historical decline in infectious diseases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that parents are now vaccinating against \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were not the result of inoculation, like doctors blindly and wrongly assert. Instead, the decline began years before the vaccines were introduced thanks to improved habits of hygiene, sanitation and nutrition that raised our natural immunity.\nDifferences among immunity reflect the importance of healthy habits\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Ever wonder why two people (even in the same household) can be exposed to the same virus while one of them is laid up in bed for a week and the other doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the slightest effect?\nAnd why is it that while nearly 50 million people died from the Spanish flu in 1918\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the case fatality rate was from two to five percent? That means that 95 to 98 percent of those who contracted the flu recovered fully. And that says nothing of the hundreds of millions of people who came into contact with the virus, but never became ill at all.\nThe difference is our individual immune system.\nAnd the bottom line is that your habits have a great deal of control over it, as shown in Nobel winning science. Work with it to acquire protection.\nThere are no Silver Bullets Against Infection, but You Have Options\nThere is no silver bullet, though.\nDespite our best efforts at nutrition, hygiene and sanitation, the immune system can still fail. Fortunately, in many cases, emergency medicine can help.\nWith all this science and technology at our fingertips, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not willing to risk my children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health on the antiquated vaccine theory\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 nor the toxic brew they contain.\nThat doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make me a religious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nut job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or conspiracy theorist. It simply means that I am an informed and caring parent with healthy kids who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to rely on risky medicines or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And since herd immunity is nothing more than an antiquated theory \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and not something that is actually protecting kids form infections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pro-vaccine parents shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a shit about my non-vaccinated kids or my use of vaccine exemption forms.\nEducate before you vaccinate.\n* Every testimonial on this site is true and correct as submitted by active customers.

Whatever side of the aisle you may fall with regard to your opinion about vaccination, one thing is for certain. The choice to vaccinate or not vaccinate is a decision that has the potential to greatly impact the health of you and most importantly, your children for the rest of their lives.\nAs a result, this decision should not be taken lightly and it should not be made in a vacuum. In other words, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just take your pediatrician\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s word that shots are safe. It is possible for doctors to be wrong. They are human, after all. In reality, your doctor is simply parroting the standard line about vaccination from the American Medical Association (AMA) playbook. If you think you are getting their honest assessment, think again.\nYou should neither assume shots are dangerous just because your friend down the street doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate her kids.\nThe key here is education; \u00c2\u00a0making an informed decision by investigating the facts with an open mind and knowing exactly what you are getting yourself into before you commit to do anything.\nWith that in mind, the list below will briefly detail to you the reasons why I did not vaccinate my own children and will never consider a shot for them for any reason even in the event of a so called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pandemic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00c2\u00a0Please remember that I come from a medical family. \u00c2\u00a0 My own Father (retired) is a MD as is my brother and my cousin (who was a pediatrician, now deceased). My husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother is a nurse. There is no shortage of opinions on this subject in my family, I can assure you.\nSo, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use family pressure as an excuse to do what you need to do once you investigate the facts for yourself and make an informed decision. There is no more foolish choice than to do something because it is someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wishes and not your own. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0It is your body, after all and these are your children. There is no one on earth who knows what is best for them except you and your spouse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not even and most especially not your doctor! Make your decisions feeling confident in this knowledge.\n#1: \u00c2\u00a0 Pharmaceutical Companies Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Be Trusted (Ever)\nLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just list a couple of the (many) times over the past 10 years where a drug or drug regimen has been deemed unsafe and downright dangerous and yet the pharmaceutical companies covered it up FOR YEARS in order to continue raking in the profits for as long as possible. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0This should be an easy task.\nHow about hormone replacement therapy for women? \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0The standard of care for a menopausal woman for over 40 years was HRT. \u00c2\u00a0 Even women with no complaints were advised that this treatment was helpful as it reduced chances for a heart attack and cancer and even helped them feel younger. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Were any, I repeat ANY of these claims true? Not a whit. Breast cancer risk is doubled for women on HRT, \u00c2\u00a041% increased risk for stroke, 29% increased risk of heart attack, and the list goes on and on.\nHow about Vioxx? \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Before this dangerous drug that caused thousands of deaths from heart attack and stroke was finally removed from the market, evidence surfaced that Merck had withheld information and even doctored reports on its dangers years before. As of November 2007, Merck had agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle approximately 27,000 cases from victims claiming injury or death of a family member using Vioxx. While this is a huge sum of money, in reality it represents less than one year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits for Merck. \u00c2\u00a0 Does it pay for a drug company to lie about a drug\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safety and efficacy? You betcha. The risk of payouts to victims from getting sued is lower than the lure of huge and long lasting profits while a drug\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patent protection remains in effect.\nI could cite other examples, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m trying to keep this post as pithy as possible. Please comment if you have other examples of pharmaceutical company deceit. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0It will help others reading this blog who might still be on the fence about this issue.\nRemember the old proverb, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fool me once, shame on you; \u00c2\u00a0Fool me twice, shame on me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? \u00c2\u00a0These corporate behemoths have proven themselves to be completely untrustworthy based on past behavior. \u00c2\u00a0 In a court of law, if such a company were an actual witness, an attorney would never put them on the stand due to a serious lack of credibility. \u00c2\u00a0 Are you really going to take these companies at their word that these shots are safe when money and profits are impacted by their answer?\nUPDATE: \u00c2\u00a0Merck, the manufacturer of the MMR vaccine is currently embroiled in two lawsuits for falsifying data on the effectiveness of the mumps vaccine. One of these lawsuits was brought by two of its own scientists! \u00c2\u00a0Just another example of a the lying and fraud perpetuated by the drug companies with regard to vaccination.\n#2: \u00c2\u00a0 ALL Vaccines are Loaded with Chemicals and Heavy Metals\nHere is a list of some of the damaging ingredients in the vaccines on the market today:\nMSG, antifreeze, phenol (used as a disinfectant), formaldehyde (cancer causing and used to embalm), aluminum (associated with alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease and seizures), glycerin (toxic to the kidney, liver, can cause lung damage, gastrointestinal damage and death), lead, cadmium, sulfates, yeast proteins, antibiotics, acetone  (used in nail polish remover),  neomycin  and  streptomycin .\u00c2\u00a0 And the ingredient making the press  is thimerosol (more toxic than mercury, a preservative still used in many vaccines, not easily eliminated, can cause severe neurological damage as well as other life threatening autoimmune disease).  These vaccines are grown and strained through animal or human tissue, like  monkey and dog kidney tissue, chick embryo, calf serum, human diploid cells (the dissected organs of forcibly aborted fetuses), pig blood, horse blood and rabbit brain (1,\u00c2\u00a02).\nWhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, recent vaccine testing results published in January 2017 revealed that ALL of them are contaminated with heavy metals not declared on the ingredients list or in the product leaflets. In another round of vaccine testing conducted in Germany, the vaccines were found to be contaminated with the following:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c ALL vaccines tested contained mercury in small amounts (even the ones that were supposedly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mercury free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd).\n \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Half the vaccines contained toxic, carcinogenic nickel in small amounts.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Slightly over 1\/3 of the tested vaccines contained small amounts of arsenic.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Over 90% of the tested vaccines contained uranium (yes, the stuff used to make nuclear bombs).\n \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ALL tested vaccines contain minor traces of aluminum, *even if not labeled*.\u00c2\u00a0Gardasil, Gardasil 9 and Synflorix contain TWICE as much aluminum as indicated.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The aluminum content in the so-called attenuated vaccines is around 1000-6000X times above\u00c2\u00a0the safe limits for drinking water! And these vaccines are supposedly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? By the way, aluminum adjuvants\u00c2\u00a0commonly used in vaccines have been identified by immunologists as a trigger for later development of food allergies in children.\nCan you imagine injecting this cocktail of poison directly into your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tissues? Anyone who thinks that these contaminants even in small amounts are safe especially for a growing child is just plain out of his\/her mind. At least if you ate these ingredients, your body would have a chance to detoxify and eliminate them before any permanent damage could be done. But, to inject them deep into the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tissues where the toxins are absorbed directly into the blood is the most damaging and lethal approach imaginable. How could anyone\u00c2\u00a0especially a doctor possibly think this approach to enhancing immunity to infectious disease is a good idea for the long term health? As it turns out, more doctors are realizing the folly of shots as a growing percentage of pediatricians are declining or delaying shots for their own children!\nIt sure didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any sense to me. Here I am, 20 years later, still very happy with my decision NOT to vaccinate my children. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, my three children thank me all the time for not vaccinating them. Why? They see all the health problems their vaccinated friends have, and they are grateful to have been spared the misery.\nSadly, I know many parents and caregivers with 20\/20 hindsight who greatly regret their decision to vaccinate. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know ANYONE who has not vaccinated and regrets their decision, however. Which group do you want to be a part of in 10 years?\n#3: \u00c2\u00a0 Vaccinated Children are the Unhealthiest, Most Chronically Sick Children\nA comprehensive survey of nearly 12,000 children in the USA and Europe was conducted in 2010. The research revealed the truth about the health of vaccinated vs unvaccinated kids. The conclusion?\u00c2\u00a0Vaccinated children are more chronically ill than unvaccinated children\u00c2\u00a0with rates for\u00c2\u00a0autism, ear infections, ADHD, asthma and allergies as much as 30% higher than unvaxed children (source).\nAnother large comparative study of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children published in May 2017 unearthed similar findings (source).\nTake an informal poll of the folks in your circle and see for yourself. Observation is a powerful tool, so put it to use. The kids with the most health and behavior problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c allergies, asthma, ADHD, autism, coordination and other gross motor issues, and the list goes on \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are the ones that are right on track with their vaccination schedule.\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just physical illness that plagues vaccinated children either.\u00c2\u00a0Research out of Yale and Penn State demonstrated a strong association between vaccination and mental illness in children. 95,000 children were analyzed by the Department of Public Health Science at the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine and Yale University. A strong association between children receiving vaccinations and then immediate development of brain-related autoimmune and inflammatory disorders: ADHD, OCD, anxiety, depression, bipolar, anorexia, and chronic tic disorder was found (source).\nFor compelling anecdotal evidence, ask Moms with several children, some of whom are vaccinated and some who are not, which of their children are the healthiest. In my own circle, the Moms I know who have one or two older kids who are fully vaccinated and the younger kids who did not get any shots tell me that, hands down, that the unvaccinated children are healthier and have less problems (usually none).\nThere is plenty of research available NOW for any open-minded, thinking parent to realize that vaccination of a child is a very bad idea. Throw out your preconceived ideas, read the science and realize the reality that shots will very likely doom your child to a life of autoimmune or mental disorder hell. Playing the odds for a healthy child with a robust immune system free of mental health issues critically involves the decision to forgo shots.\nThe excellent graphic below pretty much says it all. Vaccinated children suffer from far more challenges both mentally, physically, and behaviorally than unvaccinated children. This is the dirty little secret Big Pharma doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want you to know!\nGraphic from the\u00c2\u00a0Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Medical Safety Research Institute.\nIn 1975, Japan raised its minimum vax age to 2 years old, \u00c2\u00a0The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infant mortality subsequently plummeted to such low levels that Japan now enjoys one of the lowest level in the Western world (#3 at last look). \u00c2\u00a0In comparison, the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 infant mortality rate is #33.\nIn Australia, the flu vaccine was suspended in April 2010 for children under 5 because an alarming number of children were showing up in the emergency rooms with febrile convulsions or other vaccine reactions within hours of getting this shot.\nIn the UK, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even require the chicken pox vaccine because it causes so many health problems not just for children, but also triggers the grave risk of a shingles epidemic for adults (source). By the way, the shingles vaccine doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even work, which is likely why the UK continues to not offer the varicella vaccine to children.\nNeed I say more?\nHere is a brief list of some of the vaccines that have caused serious injury in recent years. Please comment with others that you know of if they are not on this list:\nIf the vaccines above have had serious problems, the others probably do too as vaccine manufacturers follow the same basic formula when coming up with each new shot.\nProcrastination is usually considered a character flaw, but in the case of vaccination, delaying the decision for as long as possible plays to your advantage. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0The longer you wait to vaccinate your child, the better. \u00c2\u00a0 A child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system continues to develop for years after birth. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0The blood\/brain barrier does not fully develop until adolescence. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 The longer you wait, the more likely your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system will be able to handle the onslaught with minimal damage.\nIf you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to do, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything!\nConversely, you can never undo a vaccination. There are holistic therapies that can detox a child from the vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poison, but the damage that is done can never be 100% repaired. \u00c2\u00a0 And, I have NEVER met a fully vaccinated child that is healthier and more robust than a well nourished, unvaccinated child. \u00c2\u00a0 Period.\nWhile I would like to convince you to never vaccinate your child, if I can simply convince you to delay it for a few years that is certainly better than vaccinating a baby. \u00c2\u00a0If you can simply commit to waiting until your child is school age to vaccinate, so much the better than if you vaccinate as a toddler and so on. Time is on your side and waiting is the best policy when it comes to shots.\nAnother vaccine alternative to consider is homeoprophylaxis. This nontoxic method to boost immunity safely is gaining rapid popularity due to the numerous scientific studies involving millions of people to support its efficacy. And, if your child starts to regress after shots, be sure to do the emergency vaccine detox recommended by developmental pediatrician Dr. Mary Megson.\nBy the time your child is older, more research will have been done, you will have an opportunity to learn more and become more comfortable with your decision to wait. \u00c2\u00a0Who knows? \u00c2\u00a0Your attitude of wait and see may turn out to be permanent like mine was 20 years ago.\n","225":"At the beginning of year, as measles rapidly spread among people who had recently visited Disneyland, health officials suspected the outbreak may have been linked to pockets of people who refuse vaccinations. Now, a new study provides some evidence to back up that theory.\nMeasles is highly contagious. Since it can spread so easily, moving through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, one person who has it can potentially put thousands of other people at risk. In order for a population to achieve \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considered to be well-protected against measles, more than 95 percent of people need to receive the MMR vaccine that prevents them from contracting the infectious disease. \nBut, according to the new research published in JAMA Pediatrics, the people who were infected in the recent measles outbreak have vaccination rates that fall well below that recommended threshold. The researchers estimated that the rate could not have been higher than about 86 percent, and may have been as low as 50 percent.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clearly, MMR vaccination rates in many of the communities that have been affected by this outbreak fall well below the necessary threshold to sustain herd immunity, thus placing the greater population at risk as well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the researchers concluded.\nThe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patient zero\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Disneyland measles outbreak, which led to nearly 200 infections over the past three months, has not yet been confirmed. Federal officials suspect that a foreign visitor to the theme park brought the disease from overseas. Then, measles was able to spread quickly among clusters of families who have rejected the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immunization schedule for their children.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Disneyland outbreak is quite possibly a direct consequence of the growing anti-vaccination movement in the United States,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Maimuna Majumder, a research fellow at Boston Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital and one of the authors of the new JAMA study, told HealthDay. She added that if that movement continues to grow, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the likelihood of outbreaks will increase \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as will their scale and scope.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \nMajumder explained that while experts have speculated that the recent spread of measles was due to low vaccine rates, her study \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confirms this suspicion in a scientifically rigorous way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Other infectious disease experts who were not involved in the research agree, and have expressed some fears about the troubling implications of her findings.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153A level of protection against measles as low as 50 percent makes pediatricians, infectious-disease experts, and the public health community profoundly concerned,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told Live Science.\nWhile the JAMA study is the first to definitively link vaccine refusal to the most recent measles outbreak, previous studies have documented a similar trend on a larger scale. Across the country, federal health officials have tracked a rise in the number of measles cases that they say are driven by a fewer number of people getting the MMR shot. Although the national rates of MMR vaccination are around 92 percent, recent research has found that unvaccinated people tend to cluster together in the same community, which allows contagious diseases to more easily spread. Some school districts in Colorado, for example, have undervaccination rates five times higher than the state average.\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rare for Americans to reject every single recommended childhood vaccine. According to one 2009 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, just two percent of the population refuses vaccines altogether. \nNonetheless, anti-vaccine beliefs are still finding a way to take hold. A large portion of vaccine skeptical parents are opting to delay vaccines, spacing out their kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shots based on the misguided belief that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harmful for children to get too many shots at once. That can leave their children unprotected for longer than they would have been otherwise \u00e2\u20ac\u201d potentially exposing them to diseases like measles, even if their parents are planning on eventually giving them the MMR shot.\n","226":" Q. My daughter Lyla Rose Belkin died at the age of five weeks, shortly after receiving a Hepatitis B vaccine booster shot.The following comments are intended to be a heads up to parents and potential parents about the risks of the Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), and a firsthand report questioning the scientific legitimacy of the vaccine industry, which provides $800 million of annual revenue to Merck -- the company which makes the Hepatitis B vaccine distributed in the US.\n  Lyla Rose Belkin was a lively, alert five-week-old baby when I last held her in my arms. Little did I imagine as she gazed intently into my eyes with all the innocence and wonder of a newborn child that she would die that night. She was never ill before receiving the Hepatitis B shot that afternoon. At her final feeding that night, she was agitated and feisty -- and then fell asleep and didn't wake up. The autopsy ruled out choking. A swollen brain was the only abnormal finding. Most doctors I spoke to at the time said it must have been Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a catch-all diagnosis for unexplainable childhood mortality. The first instinctive reaction in such a situation is for parents to blame themselves. For many weeks, my wife and I agonized over what we might have missed or could have done differently. Meanwhile, the logical part of my brain kept returning to the obvious medical event that preceded Lyla's death -- and that internal voice kept asking the question could the Hepatitis B vaccine that Lyla received that afternoon have killed her? Most doctors I asked scoffed at that notion and said the vaccine was perfectly safe. But I began to search around on the Internet and Medline and discovered disturbing evidence of adverse reactions to this vaccine.\n  In the US, the Hepatitis B disease mainly infects intravenous drug users, homosexuals, prostitutes and promiscuous heterosexuals. The disease is transmitted by blood, through sex or dirty needles. How could a newborn baby possibly get Hepatitis B if the mother was screened and tested negative, as my wife was? It is almost impossible. Unless a newborn child is having unprotected sex or sharing needles with an infected junkie, it is extremely unlikely to get the Hepatitis B disease. So then why are most U.S. babies inoculated at birth by their hospital or pediatrician with the Hepatitis B vaccine? That is a question every parent should ask before getting this vaccination. I've discovered the answer is an unrestrained health bureaucracy decided it couldn't get junkies, gays, prostitutes and promiscuous heterosexuals to take the Hepatitis B vaccine so they mandated that all babies must be vaccinated at birth. Drug companies such as Merck (reaching for new markets) were instrumental in pushing government scientists to adopt an at-birth Hepatitis B vaccination policy, although the vaccine was never tested in newborns and no vaccines had ever been mandated at birth before. It is widely recognized that newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, which can be overwhelmed or shocked.\n  My search for answers about a link between the Hepatitis B vaccine and my daughter's death led me to a Hepatitis B vaccine workshop on October 26th at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), Institute of Medicine entitled Vaccine Safety Forum -- Neonatal Deaths. The NAS was concerned enough about reports of Hepatitis B vaccine-related infant deaths and adverse reactions to hold a special workshop on the subject. Doctors and scientists flew in from all over the U.S. and Europe to attend. I sat in the back and soaked it all up. It was a real eye-opener. There were basically four constituencies represented: 1) Serious scientists observing or presenting research studies. 2) Center for Disease Control (CDC) pseudo-statisticians and FDA officials. 3) Merck and other corporate drug officials, and 4) Parents of vaccine-related dead or severely injured children.\n  The presentations included a study of Animal Models of Newborn Response to Antigen Presentation, which showed that newborn immune systems were undeveloped and strikingly different than those of adults. The message I received was that immune response in a newborn to shocks such as being injected with a vaccine was potentially unknown, since newborn T-Cells have a radically different behavior then those of adults. Another presentation was Strategies for Evaluating the Biologic Mechanisms of Hepatitis B Vaccine Reactions, in which vaccine researcher Dr. Bonnie Dunbar of Baylor College related numerous Hepatitis B-vaccine related cases of nervous system damage in adults, such as Multiple Sclerosis, seizures and blindness. On the more positive side, the FDA presented a seemingly reassuring study from its Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), which showed only 19 neonatal deaths reported since 1991 related to Hepatitis B vaccination.\n  I found the VAERS study data to be completely deceptive. Since I was sitting in that room and my daughter had died during their sample period and wasn't counted -- I wondered why. In fact, the New York City Coroner called VAERS to report my daughter's Hepatitis B Vaccine-related infant death and no one ever returned their call! What kind of reporting system doesn't return the calls of the NY City Medical Examiner -- and how many other reports were ignored? This is supposed to be the emergency 911 number for disasters such as bad lots of vaccine that could poison thousands of other babies. With the personal knowledge that the VAERS data was completely flawed, I sat in that room and listened in amazement as CDC officials and Dr. Sharrar of Merck (their head of vaccine safety) made disparaging comments about any possible risk from Hepatitis B vaccination, despite the evidence just presented by impartial scientists.\n  I studied statistics and econometrics at UC Berkeley and have developed innovative methods of applying probability to financial and economic data in my consulting business with some of the largest financial institutions in the world. That training and experience qualifies me to criticize the statistical legitimacy of the VAERS study, on which Sharrar of Merck and the CDC pseudo-scientists based their pro-vaccination stance. Their comments were scathingly dismissive of any possible risk from the vaccine. But that VAERS study is not a legitimate sample of a data set from which any conclusions about the larger population can be made. VAERS doesn't return coroner's calls, leading to the suspicion that deaths and adverse effects from vaccination are woefully under-reported. To conclude that the Hepatitis B vaccine is safe because VAERS only reports 19 deaths is scientific fraud. In fact, I obtained the raw data from the VAERS system and found 54 reported SIDS cases after Hepatitis B vaccination in just the 18 months from January 1996 to May 1997. That's almost 15 times as many deaths per year as their own flawed study reported. There are 17,000 reports of adverse reactions to Hepatitis B vaccine in the 1996-97 raw data. Clearly, something is fishy about VAERS. VAERS was set up by the FDA and CDC and is supposed to be monitored by vaccine manufacturers. If there are 17,000 reports and VAERS doesn't even return the NY Medical Examiner's call, how many other deaths and injuries go unreported? I came away from that NAS workshop with the distinct impression that Merck and the CDC didn't know and didn't really want to know how many babies are being killed or injured by Hepatitis B vaccination. This is a bureaucratic vaccination program that is on auto-pilot flying into a mountain. The CDC bureaucrats have a vested interest in the status quo. If there were 17,000 reports of a dangerous disease in a 18 month period, the CDC would be all over the case. But when there are 17,000 reports of adverse reactions to a vaccine the CDC advocates for \"public health,\" the CDC dismisses it as a coincidence. Merck charges $50 a shot for the three-shot series. Where do you think the allegiance of their vaccine safety official Dr. Sharrar lies? He was by far the most arrogant character at the workshop. Merck has sales of upwards of $800 million a year from vaccines.\n  Vaccination can be a lifesaver if an epidemic is raging, but in this case the risk of vaccination outweighs the risk of infants getting the disease. Surely, the hepatitis B vaccine doesn't injure every child that gets it, but in some unknown number of cases, it appears to be a death sentence and\/or a nervous system toxin to innocent children who are at no risk of getting the disease the vaccine is supposed to protect against. My observations of Merck and CDC scientists at the Vaccine Safety Forum left me with the distinct impression that they had absolutely no idea which babies might be killed or injured by this vaccine. Furthermore, they used obviously flawed scientific data to arrogantly steamroller any opposition to their power. Parents should beaware that the Hepatitis B vaccine is not administered for the well-being of their child. Rather, it is delivered by the long arm of some incompetent and mindless bureaucracy in the name of stamping out a disease most babies can't possibly get. The Drug Company\/CDC\/FDA alliance has really pulled the wool over the medical profession's eyes with the Hepatitis B vaccine. The American Pediatric Society bought the alliance's sales pitch and now recommends that all infants get this vaccine at birth. So now the first thing most babies get in life is a shock to their immune system from a vaccine against a non-existent risk of contracting Hepatitis B. Clearly, the interests of newborn babies were not represented on the original panel that created this vaccination policy in 1991. This vaccine has no benefit whatsoever for newborns, in fact it wears off and they will need booster shots later in life when they actually could get exposed to the disease.\n  This is simply a case of ravenous corporate greed and mindless bureaucracy teaming up to overwhelm common sense. Merck in particular has gone way over the edge with this vaccination program. Ignoring and suppressing reports of adverse reactions to their profitable Hepatitis B vaccine verges on criminal conduct. A major media organization will soon present an investigative report on the issues discussed here. Nothing will ever bring my lovely daughter Lyla back, but other needless deaths and injuries can be prevented if this senseless Hepatitis B newborn vaccination program is halted. Please contact Belkin Limited in New York City if you are aware of other infant deaths that may be related to the Hepatitis B vaccine.\n  A. Dear Mr. Belkin, I am truly sorry to hear your sad story about Lyla's reaction to the Hepatitis B vaccine. Everyday I receive letters similar to yours. This is why we must continue to speak out against this form of medical tyranny. Parents are entitled to a full disclosure of all available information, and must remain free to accept or reject the shots.\n  Your letter is especially eloquent. Hopefully, your tragedy will prove to be a blessing to many other parents as you become more involved. Clearly, you can make a difference by choosing to devote your time and efforts toward one or more aspects of this very large \"vaccine beast.\" Best wishes to you.\n  Q. TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL BELKIN BEFORE THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES -- CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (February 17, 1999) -- Atlanta Georgia\n  My name is Michael Belkin. I am a father, businessman, former quantitative strategist at Salomon Brothers, and Director of the Hepatitis B Vaccine Project of the National Vaccine Information Center(NVIC).\n  The NVIC has studied Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act covering the last nine years on hepatitis B vaccine adverse events -- and in 1996 there were more than three times as many reported serious adverse reactions as reported cases of the disease in the 0 to 14 age group. Of the total 2,424 adverse event reports made between 1990 and October 1998 in children under age 14 who only received hepatitis B vaccine, there were 1,209 serious events and 73 deaths. Thus, one half of the reports for children under age 14 who received only hepatitis B vaccine were for serious events that required an emergency room visit, hospitalization, or caused life-threatening health problems or permanent disabilities.\n  As a UC Berkeley graduate and advisor to some of the largest financial institutions in the world, I am qualified to analyze and make conclusions about statistics. Based on that experience, I am astonished that the scientists on this Committee would disregard or cover up data showing the number and severity of adverse reactions to this vaccine. Science is observing and learning from what is observed. The assertions of the CDC that the many reported adverse reactions to this vaccine do not exist or are a coincidence violates the basic principle of science, which is rooted in the observation and analysis of data.\n  A benefit\/risk analysis of the hepatitis B vaccine for the average infant in America, not born to infected parents, must conclude that the VAERS data on adverse reactions shows the real-world risk of a newborn infant dying or being injured by the hepatitis B vaccine is a greater threat than the remote chance of contracting the primarily blood-transmitted disease.\n  My 5-week old daughter, Lyla Rose, died within 16 hours of her hepatitisB vaccination, which she received because of the universal vaccination policy this Committee instituted in 1991. At her death, Lyla had four of the eight highest-reported symptoms in the VAERS hepatitis B vaccine adverse reaction data. The NY Medical Examiner observed brain swelling at the autopsy but refused to record that or mention the hepatitis B vaccine Lyla received in the autopsy report.\n  I hold each one of you who participated in the promulgation or perpetuation of that mandated newborn vaccination policy personally responsible for my daughter's death and the deaths and injuries of all the other beautiful, healthy infants who are victims of the hepatitis B vaccine. Your negligence is the proximate cause of my daughter's death and you have failed to exercise reasonable care.\n  At the NVIC, we are overwhelmed following up constant new reports of deaths, seizures and autoimmune reactions following hepatitis B vaccination. Because the CDC refuses to acknowledge this large number of serious adverse reactions, hospitals and doctors who have been misled about the risks continue to administer the vaccine and then deny any vaccine connection when children die, get ill or have seizures within hours or days. CDC officials tell parents they have never heard of hepatitis B vaccine reactions.\n  That is a lie. For this government to continue to insist that hepatitis B vaccine adverse reaction reports do not exist is negligent, unethical -- and is a crime against the children of America.\n  It is a sad day for the U.S. when the nation's children need protection from the official medical authorities who are charged with protecting them from disease.\n  Thank you.\n  A. Thanks for sending the testimony. I will post it to our site with other Hepatitis B information.\n  Keep pushing! You are clearly a force for positive change. Our site receives emails daily from parents telling horrendous stories -- from Hepatitis B shots and from the others as well. Many parents see the damage after the 1st or 2nd set of shots, yet continue with the series because their doctor denies a correlation. It's absolutely maddening.\n   Q. MICHAEL BELKIN TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS (Tuesday May 18, 1999)\n  My daughter Lyla Rose Belkin died on September 16, 1998 at the age of five weeks, about 15 hours after receiving her second Hepatitis B vaccine booster shot. Lyla was a lively, alert five-week-old baby when I last held her in my arms. Little did I imagine as she gazed intently into my eyes with all the innocence and wonder of a newborn child that she would die that night. She was never ill before receiving the Hepatitis B shot that afternoon. At her final feeding that night, she was extremely agitated, noisy and feisty -- and then she fell asleep suddenly and stopped breathing. The autopsy ruled out choking. The NY Medical Examiner ruled her death Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).\n  But the NY Medical Examiner (Dr. Persechino) neglected to mention Lyla's swollen brain or the hepatitis B vaccine in the autopsy report. The coroner spoke to my wife and I and our pediatrician (Dr. Zullo) the day of the autopsy and clearly stated that her brain was swollen. The pediatrician Dr. Zullo's notes of that conversation are \"brain swollen ... not sure cause yet ... could not see how recombinant vaccine could cause problem.\"\n  SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion ..it wasn't this, it wasn't that, everything has been ruled out and we don't know what it was. A swollen brain is not SIDS. Through conversations with other experienced pathologists, I subsequently discovered that brain inflammation is a classic adverse reaction to vaccination (with any vaccine) in the medical literature.\n  I set out to do an investigation of the Hepatitis B vaccine and attended a workshop at the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine on \"Neo-Natal Death and the Hepatitis B Vaccine,\" the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) February meeting, and a debate in New Hampshire between the Chairman of the ACIP, Dr. Modlin, and Dr. Waisbren about the safety of the Hepatitis B vaccine. I also obtained the entire Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database on Hepatitis B vaccine adverse reactions and have investigated it thoroughly.\n  These are my conclusions, supported by the following pages of text and analysis that are too lengthy to present in entirety in the time allotted for this appearance. Please read the results of my investigation, as it will help you understand the magnitude of the hepatitis B vaccine issue.\n  * Newborn babies are not at risk of contracting the hepatitis B disease unless their mother is infected.\n  * Hepatitis B is primarily a disease of junkies, gays, and promiscuous heterosexuals.\n  * The vaccine is given to babies because health authorities couldn't get those risk groups to take the vaccine.\n  * Adverse reactions out-number cases of the disease in government statistics.\n   * Nothing is being done to investigate those adverse reactions.\n  * Those adverse reactions include numerous deaths, convulsions and arthritic conditions that occur within days after   * Hepatitis B vaccination.\nThe CDC is misrepresenting hypothetical, estimated disease statistics as real cases of the disease.\n  * The ACIP is recommending new vaccines for premature infants without having scientific studies proving they are safe.\n  * The U.S. vaccine recommendation process is hopelessly compromised by conflicts of interest with vaccine manufacturers, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC.\n  Conclusion: If (as with the recently-recommended rotavirus vaccine) Hepatitis B vaccine was recommended in 1991 without scientific proof that it was safe in a broad sample of racially and genetically diverse babies less than 48 hours old before they established that recommendation, then the CDC has been experimenting on babies like guinea pigs and this Committee should suspend that universal immunization policy.\n  The Hepatitis B vaccine was effectively mandated in 1991 for universal immunization of newborn babies by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) -- an adjunct of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Paradoxically, the CDC's own Fact Sheet on the Hepatitis B disease does not include newborn babies as a risk group for that disease. That Fact Sheet lists the risk groups as injection drug users, homosexual men, sexually active heterosexuals, infants\/children of immigrants from disease-endemic areas, low socio-economic level, sexual\/household contacts of infected persons, infants born to infected mothers, health care workers and hemodialysis patients NOT NEWBORN BABIES.\n  Question: Why then, did the ACIP establish a policy mandating that newborn babies not at risk of the disease be automatically administered the 3-shot Hepatitis B vaccine as their first involuntary indoctrination into the pediatric care of America?\n  Answer: Here is that rationale from the original ACIP 1991 statement establishing the official vaccination policy   \"Hepatitis B Virus: A Comprehensive Strategy for Eliminating Transmission in the United States Through Universal Childhood Vaccination ...\"   \"In the United States, most infections occur among adults and adolescents ... The recommended strategy for preventing these infections has been the selective vaccination of persons with identified risk factors ... However, this strategy has not lowered the incidence of Hepatitis B, primarily because vaccinating persons engaged in high-risk behaviors, life-styles, or occupations before they become infected generally has not been feasible ... Efforts to vaccinate persons in the major risk groups have had limited success. For example, programs directed at injecting drug users failed to motivate them to receive three doses of vaccine ... In the United States it has become evident that HBV transmission cannot be prevented through vaccinating only the groups at high risk of infection ... In the long term, universal infant vaccination would eliminate the need for vaccinating adolescents and high-risk adults ... Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all infants, regardless of the HBsAg status of the mother ... The first dose can be administered during the newborn period, preferably before the infant is discharged from the hospital, but no later than when the infant is 2 months of age ...\" (emphasis added).\n  So in the CDC and ACIP's own words, almost every newborn U.S. baby is now greeted on its entry into the world by a vaccine injection against a sexually transmitted disease for which the baby is not at risk -- because they couldn't get the junkies, prostitutes, homosexuals and promiscuous heterosexuals to take the vaccine. That is the essence of the Hepatitis B universal vaccination program.\n  Question: What are the risks and benefits for administering this vaccine to infants?\nAnswer: Hepatitis B is a rare, mainly blood-transmitted disease. In 1996, only 54 cases of the disease were reported to the CDC in the 0-1 age group. There were 3.9 million births that year, so the observed incidence of hepatitis B in the 0-1 age group was just 0.001%. In the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), there were 1,080 total reports of adverse reactions from Hepatitis B vaccine in 1996 in the 0-1 age group, with 47 deaths reported. Total VAERS Hepatitis B reports for the 0-1 age group outnumber reported cases of the disease 20 to 1.\n  Question: Why don't they just screen the mother to see if she is infected with Hepatitis B (since that's about the only way a baby is likely to get the disease), instead of vaccinating all infants?\nAnswer: Selling vaccines is extremely profitable and the process of mandating vaccines is fraught with conflicts of interest between vaccine manufacturers, the ACIP and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The business model of having the government mandate everyone must buy your product is a monopolist's delight.\nQuestion: What studies are being done on the data from the FDA's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)?\nAnswer: Absolutely nothing. The 25,000 reports are going into a drawer and being forgotten.\n   How many reports are enough to show a drug or vaccine is dangerous -- 2,500? 25,000? 250,000? Chen of the CDC and Ellenberg of the FDA monitor this data, write reports and deliver speeches about how VAERS Hepatitis B adverse reaction reports show nothing out of the ordinary and show \"the relative safety of HB vaccine when given to neonates and infants.\" VAERS shows nothing of the kind. TAKE A LOOK AT THE VAERS DATA YOURSELF. The health authorities continue to negligently downplay the steady stream of serious adverse reactions to this vaccine and more infants and adults continue to die and suffer central nervous system and liver damage after HB vaccination.\nQuestion: Why do the CDC, ACIP and Merck say that there are 140,000-320,000 new infections\/yr (70,000-160,000 symptomatic infections\/yr) when their own CDC data shows only 10,000 reported cases year?\nAnswer: They are passing off estimated, hypothetical numbers as actual cases. This is statistical fraud. In the financial world such mis-representation would lead to criminal charges. If a company inflated its earnings or revenues by 300% (as the CDC does hepatitis B disease statistics) and foisted those figures off as official data (and not some back-of-the-envelope guess-timate) -- that company would be investigated by the SEC and sued by shareholders. Why doesn't that happen in the medical world? There's no regulator to keep the CDC honest. They do not say those figures are hypothetical estimates, they misrepresent the data. Go try to audit those 320,000 supposed new infections\/yr. You will not find them. The whole exercise is designed to increase public hysteria about the risk of a low-risk disease so the CDC can extend it's pervasive influence and Merck can increase it's $900 million\/year vaccine revenues.\n  Question: What process does the Center for Disease Control employ to make a vaccine recommendation?\nI attended the February Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting in Atlanta and was absolutely appalled. Every vote by the Committee on new vaccine mandates was unanimous (except for one dissenting vote on Rotavirus vaccine for premature infants). There was hardly any discussion of adverse reactions, the ACIP simply rubber-stamped every proposal on the agenda. I call it Vaccination Without Representation. In one instance, the ACIP passed a recommendation for Rotavirus vaccine for premature infants even though no scientific studies had been done showing it was medically safe. Dr. Modlin, (Chairman of the ACIP), said in a pro-Hepatitis B vaccine debate in New Hampshire \"How do we determine whether something is scientifically valid or not? ... 1) Is the theory biologically plausible? 2) Has it been tested by appropriate methods? 3) Is the study well concluded? 4) Are the results statistically sound?\" But at the February ACIP meeting, when it came time for the ACIP to rubber-stamp approval of Rotavirus vaccine for premature infants, here are Modlin's quotes from the official transcript: \"... available data are insufficient to fully establish the safety and efficacy of rotavirus vaccine in premature infants ... there is a section under Adverse Events that details what little information there actually are with respect to premature infants ... To my knowledge we don't have data from a clinical trial specifically ... Some bit of information from Seattle, as I recall, that had suggested there was a slight increase in relative risk for hospitalization for premature infants ... Obviously a situation where we have to make a judgment in the absence of data, and with a vaccine that has not yet been tested in the group ...\" (ACIP transcript, pages 102-112) Modlin then held a vote and the recommendation for premature infants passed nine to one -- Modlin voted yes, Dr. Glode against. This is a clear example of how the medical bureaucracy (led by the CDC and ACIP), is recommending vaccines without scientific evidence that those vaccines are safe in a broad sample of racially and genetically diverse infants.\n  What Should Be Done? This Committee should investigate the 1991 ACIP recommendation establishing universal hepatitis B vaccination of newborn babies in the hospital -- and if (as with the Rotavirus vaccine example above) no studies were done to prove this was safe in a broad sample of racially and genetically diverse babies less than 48 hours old before they established that recommendation, then the CDC has been experimenting on babies like guinea pigs and this Committee should suspend that universal immunization policy.\nI studied statistics at the University Of California at Berkeley and went on to develop sophisticated proprietary risk\/reward statistical models at Salomon Brothers from 1986-91 -- and in my subsequent, ongoing business provide statistical economic and financial forecasts to mutual funds, investment banks, pension funds and hedge funds.\nI studied VAERS Hepatitis B vaccine data obtained by the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) under the Freedom of Information Act. The data has some flaws (incomplete fields, some multiple reports) but any qualified, impartial quantitative analyst or statistician not affiliated with Merck, Smithkline, the CDC, the FDA or the AAP who examines these reports will find a clear and undeniable pattern of central nervous system (CNS) and liver disease striking thousands of people within 0-4 days after vaccination with Hepatitis B vaccine. These reports have been ignored, explained away, or considered \"acceptable\" by the FDA, CDC and drug companies. This Committee should launch an investigation of the VAERS Hepatitis B data by a team of independent scientists not beholden to vaccine manufacturers or the FDA\/CDC bureaucracy. The following is intended to be a starting point for such an investigation. This does not profess to be a complete, exhaustive analysis -- simply an overview, highlighting aspects of the data that may not previously have been brought to your attention.\n  The total 24,775 VAERS Hepatitis B reports from July 1990 to October 31, 1998 show 439 deaths and 9673 serious reactions involving emergency room visits, hospitalization, disablement or death. Therefore, more than one third of total reports were serious events. 17,497 of those total reports were for Hepatitis B vaccine only, the remainder were vaccine cocktails where hepatitis B was administered along with DPT, HIB, IPV, OPV, etc.\n  The Hepatitis-B-vaccine-only reports show a shocking cluster of reactions in females starting in their teenage years (the male\/female reporting ratio is balanced before age 16). For ages 16-55, 77% of VAERS reports are women -- more than three times as many women as men are reporting adverse reactions to Hepatitis B vaccine. The median onset of adverse event after vaccination is one day, 70% of reactions happen within four days of vaccination. Independent scientists should investigate why females are more disposed to have adverse reactions to Hepatitis B vaccine and\/or report them to VAERS. One possible explanation is that nurses have to take this vaccine for their jobs and are thus more exposed than most adults to Hepatitis B vaccine adverse reactions. Rather than dismiss that factor as an \"over-reporting bias\" as Dr. Chen of the CDC did at the February ACIP meeting, perhaps investigators might consider that nurses are alert health care workers and ought to be listened to with regard to the dangers of adverse events with any vaccine (rather than ignored). Personal case studies reported to the author have showed many teenage girls getting severe, debilitating adverse reactions to Hepatitis B vaccine, having nothing to do with nursing. Do women have a greater vulnerability to auto-immune reactions to Hepatitis B vaccine? Is the government discriminating against women by administering this vaccine without regard for genetic risk of CNS and liver disease? Those are questions that independent scientists should investigate.\n  A second area of concern is the VAERS reports involving Hepatitis B vaccine administered with other vaccines (vaccine cocktails). Health officials are fond of dismissing those reports as being attributable to Hepatitis B vaccine, because of the multiple other antigens present (almost as if they wanted to cloak Hepatitis B vaccine reactions from scrutiny). Let's avoid that controversy and focus on the extremely disturbing VAERS data of Hepatitis B vaccine with other vaccines. These reports amount to only one third of total reports (7,275), but account for two thirds of total deaths (291). The median onset of those deaths was 2 days after vaccination -- displaying a clear temporal association. The median age of death was 0.5 years in this group. 50% of all Hepatitis-B-vaccine-cocktail reports were serious (died, emergency room, hospitalized, disabled). I grouped convulsive reactions together from the Hep-B-vaccine-cocktail data and found a deeply disturbing pattern. These were anything labeled convulsions, seizures or tremors in the VAERS Hep-B-cocktail data. Of the 1189 such reports, fully 80% (950) were serious (died, ER, hospitalized, disabled) median age 0.5 years, median onset after vaccination 0 days (less than one day). Someone should do follow-up and find out what happened to those poor infants who suffered severe convulsions after a Hepatitis B-multi-vaccine cocktail. In the personal reports I've taken of similar adverse reactions, the children were left brain-damaged and developmentally disabled. Looking beyond the debate over whether VAERS reports of vaccine cocktails can be attributed to Hepatitis B, the data strongly suggests combining multiple vaccines may be convenient and profitable for pediatricians -- but fatal or debilitating for infants. Where are the scientific studies showing Hepatitis B vaccine is safe to administer with DPT, HIB, IPV, OPV, etc.? Did anyone doing cost\/benefit analysis for those studies include data showing the higher mortality and serious reactions present in the VAERS data? Why not? Is there an identifiable genetic marker in those who suffered convulsive reactions to screen out those vulnerable in the future? These are all matters for independent scientists to audit.\n  Another area that leaps out of the VAERS database is something I dubbed arthritic reactions. These are joint pains, tingling, numbness, aching, fatigue, etc. I found 2,400 of those reports in just a quick survey of the first reporting column of VAERS (Hepatitis B vaccine only). Almost one half of those are serious, involving an ER visit, hospitalization, death or disablement. These are the type of adverse reactions reported by many adults who are forced to take the Hepatitis B vaccine for their jobs. In the reports of such adverse reactions I've taken, the symptoms do not go away, most patients complain it gets worse over time. Scientists not corrupted by drug company or CDC\/FDA institutional bias should examine the thousands of VAERS Hepatitis B arthritic reaction reports and develop a diagnosis of their Hepatitis B vaccine-related illness.\n  Anyone who doubts if Hepatitis B vaccine adverse reactions exist should sit down and read the symptoms and text comments of a random selection of VAERS reports. When one does so, they will find a similar but wide-ranging list of CNS and liver reactions that occur within days of vaccination. The Merck package insert claims \"Injection site reactions and systemic complaints were reported following 17% and 15% on the injections, respectively.\" The standard rule of thumb is only about 10% of reactions are reported to VAERS. So the actual number and full horror of the Hepatitis B vaccine reaction story is potentially much larger than even VAERS suggests.\n  A. Wow. Thank you.\n  Q. Can you give me some information on effects of Hepatitis B vaccine on children? My grandson had the first shot when he was only hours old and the second one about a month later. He has had several seizures since and his skin breaks out in a red itchy rash. He has been seizure-free for the last two years but still gets a bad rash. He'll be four this month. Thank you.\n  A. We have received numerous notices from parents reporting serious reactions following the Hepatitis b vaccine, and after other shots as well. How do you know the hepatitis vaccine, and not the others, is causing the reactions? The DPT vaccine often causes seizures. Is your son or daughter continuing this damaging vaccine regimen? For extensive information on this vaccine -- and the other vaccines as well -- we recommend the Vaccine Safety Manual. \n     Q. My son, who is in the 7th grade is due to have his Hepatitis shots. I am seriously considering having him exempted from this because he has a brother and a sister with juvenile diabetes (type 1). Do you have any information on autoimmune diseases and vaccines? I read an article in an ALIVE magazine that told of a study that revealed an outbreak of type 1 diabetes following Hepatitis vaccination. Please help, I have to decide soon.\n  A. We receive many stories detailing problems with the Hepatitis B vaccine. We recommend that you research this topic further before consenting. Many people exempt their children from the shots; you have that legal right. Thinktwice\/New Atlantean Press offers Vaccine Books and State Laws. You may benefit from some of these resources.\n    Q. Hello. I am writing because I am quite concerned about my 18 year old sister who has been getting grand mal seizures for three years now, ever since she was vaccinated against Hepatitis b. She got her first seizure the day of the vaccination and is now taking Tegretol. However, she has recently been complaining of even more annoying symptoms, one of them being that she is constantly seeing flashing lights and dark spots, which make it very difficult for her to read and concentrate on other things. The doctor she just saw said that the seizures could be atrophying her occipital lobe, and that seizure activity could even be spreading to the temporal lobe, which could start to affect her intelligence. He also said that since the MRI he just saw was not too clear, he could not tell whether the small size of the occipital lobe was caused by atrophy or fluid in the brain, and postulated that she could even have viral encephalitis. What do you think about this? Is it possible to get viral encephalitis from a Hepatitis B vaccine, and if so what is one supposed to do to treat it, or prevent the seizures from getting worse? Please respond as soon as possible. Thank you very much.\n  A. I am sorry to hear about your story. \"Viral encephalitis\" is a term that we often hear. It seems to be the preferred diagnosis for several ailments that begin immediately following the administration of a damaging vaccine.\n   We are not health practitioners and therefore are unfamiliar with the best treatments for your sister's condition. However, our website provides the names of some organizations that may be able to alleviate or reverse vaccine damage. Your sister should be sure to call 1-800-822-7967 to file a report with the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) on this incident. I'm sorry that we cannot be more helpful. Best wishes in your efforts to find a beneficial treatment.\n     Q. I'm writing this letter to ask if you could tell me what might have happened to my 11 year old daughter when she received her second Hepatitis b shot. After the nurse injected the shot into her arm she got up and almost tripped into the next examination room across the hall and fell flat to the ground. I went to pick her up not knowing what had happened, and when I lifted her up she was lifeless, and then her body started to shake. It was very frightening. The nurse and doctor came over to her and she started to cry. She had passed out, and when she hit the floor her chin was bleeding and she had to get six stitches. The doctor seems to think that she just passed out, but I am concerned about why she shook the way she did! She seems okay now, but I am scared to death to get her third shot. Can you please tell me your opinion or let me know if you ever heard of a reaction to the Hepatitis B shot? Thank you. I'll be waiting for your reply.\n  A. Have we ever heard of a reaction to the Hepatitis b shot? We receive email responses just like yours regularly. Many of the vaccines are causing damage to our children, yet the medical establishment continues to live in a deep state of denial. I hope you are now prepared to investigate this problem further and take the necessary steps to protect your daughter from this madness. Also, report this incident to VAERS since your doctor probably did not, even though he is required to report it by law. Call: 1-800-822-7967.\n     Q. I talked to a Dr. Bonnie Dunbar who is a professor of Molecular Biology at Baylor College of Medicine. Her brother, who is also a PhD, had an adverse reaction to the Hepatitis b vaccine and is now bedridden. I am a registered nurse who had a reaction to the same vaccine. My life has also been totally altered by this, but fortunately I am not bedridden. Mine was an autoimmune reaction. I was 44 years old when it happened. Do you know if anything is being done about this problem? I know several other nurses across the country and a doctor in Hawaii that have Lupus or Multiple Sclerosis after taking the same type recombinant vaccine.\n  A. I am sorry to hear of the problems you mention. However, the stories are common; we hear of people being damaged by the Hepatitis B vaccine (and others as well) on a regular basis, yet authorities continue to deny the extent of the problem. Be sure to contact VAERS to file a report of the incident.\n    Q. Can you possibly guide me in the right direction. I was a registered nurse until I had an autoimmune reaction to Hepatitis B vaccine. I am now disabled and would like to become more familiar with other cases like mine. My worker's compensation case is still pending, and I would like to review similar cases but don't know where to look for them. I believe we are ready to either settle the case or go to hearing shortly. Thank you for any help you can give me.\n    A. Try contacting Michael Belkin with the National Vaccine Information Center. Their contact information is listed on our website under support organizations. Good luck.\n    Q. I am an American working in Pakistan with the United Nations. The 17 year old daughter of one of my staff has experienced a severe reaction to Hepatitis b vaccine. Can you advise on institutions, groups, or individuals with special knowledge or experience relevant to such a case. Thank you.\n  A. Your experience is one that we hear of quite often. You might try contacting Dr. Viera Scheibner in Australia. She is knowledgeable about this problem. Fax: 61-24-787-8988.\n    Q. Dear sirs, it seems strange writing to unknown people on the other side of the world in search of an answer to my problem. Maybe you will be able to help me. I am 50 years of age. In 1989 I was given vaccination against Hepatitis B by my employers (Engerix B). The day after vaccination I was very ill -- pains in all parts of my body. This illness never fully went away. I have been attending doctors ever since, with constant infection, severe headaches, fatigue, insomnia, loss of libido. There is no doubt that these symptoms began with the vaccination. My GP at the time said I was suffering the initial reaction to the first dose of Hepatitis vaccine. I have been hospitalised on 3 different occasions for tests. Doctors do not appear to want to look at the possibility that the vaccine was related to my illness. I can find no one that will look at my problem from this angle. For nine years I have been ill, and for the last year I have been unfit for work, or for that matter any activity . My quality of life is destroyed and there does not seem to be any way of getting better. I am certain if I found a doctor to look at my illness from the vaccine side there would at least be a chance of recovery. Can you help? Point me towards a doctor, specialist, consultant in this part of the world who could examine my problem for me?\n   A. I am sorry to hear of your plight. We receive many letters similar to yours. France recently suspended use of this vaccine due to its association with Multiple Sclerosis. Viera Scheibner in Australia is an expert. She may be able to help. The National Vaccine Information Center (visit their website) recently published an excellent booklet on the Hepatitis B vaccine. I recommend it. They may also know someone in your area to help. You may also wish to contact some of the individuals and organizations listed on our site. Many claim some degree of success reversing vaccine damage. Good luck.\n    Q. Help! when I took my five-week-old daughter in for her check-up, the doctor made me feel really guilty about not having her vaccinated for Hepatitis B. So, wanting to be a good parent, I agreed to have her get the vaccine. Now, I am terrified that it is going to hurt her! My grandmother had rhreumatoid arthritis and diabetes. My mother has diabetes also. I am afraid that this vaccine will trigger this in my daughter. I couldn't figure out why in the world a baby would need such a vaccine. Usually a person develops Hepatitis B from sharing needles or from unprotected sex. So a baby would not be in danger unless the parents were infected, which we are not. My main concern and question is that I don't want to give her the remaining two shots. I want to know, if she doesn't get the other two shots, if that could hurt her. What would getting only one shot do to her? Could that affect her immune system in some weird way? Please respond soon! Her second shot is coming up and I don't know what to do.\n  A. If you believe the vaccine is toxic or potentially dangerous, then I don't see how continuing to inject your daughter with it can be beneficial. You are not required by law to vaccinate your daughter, nor to listen to doctors' coercive speeches and intimidation tactics. Good luck with your decisions.\n    Q. My chiropractor showed me a TV spot which highlighted the correlation between Hepatitis B vaccine in children and multiple sclerosis. The research was out of Baylor University. The TV station got such a huge response that they aired the same spot nightly for two weeks. Do you have any additional information?\n  A. On January 22, 1999, \"20\/20\" did an expose on the Hepatitis B vaccine. You may be able to acquire a transcript or video of the show.\n    Q. Our 6 year old son became ill after his 1st dose of Hepatitis B vaccine in August of 1997, and had a fever of 103 degrees for 5 days. After his second dose he had a fever that did not go away. Three months later he was diagnosed with Rheumatic fever. One month later his blood counts dropped and he was rediagnosed with A.L.L. leukemia. Has A.L.L. ever been linked with Hepatitis B vaccinations? If so, can you offer suggestions on what can be done? Thanks for your help.\n  A. The Hepatitis B vaccine is causing numerous serious reactions throughout the world. The TV show \"20\/20\" did an expose' on this vaccine. France suspended use of this vaccine because of its association with multiple sclerosis. Yet, USA doctors and the U.S. government continue to deny the problem, and children continue to become damaged as a result. Be sure to report this reaction to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System: 1-800-822-7967. Best wishes.\n     Q. I am a mother of 3 boys, 6, 4, and almost 7 months, but the problem with my family is, we no longer have our 7 month old baby. We lost our dear son. And to make matters worse, he passed away 5 days after receiving just one shot -- the HEPATITIS B SHOT! He was born healthy, ate well, was processing well, went for his check up like both of my other children. (The doctor commented how well he was doing, and how healthy he was.) The doctor asked me if I would like to give him the one shot now and the others two weeks later. IF I WOULD HAVE ONLY KNOWN!!!!!! I thought what I was doing was the right thing for my child, and even better than having him get all at one time, not knowing at the time that I would lose him 5 days later. From the day he passed away, I believed it was the shot. I could not see anything else wrong with him. My mind will never be at peace. If I had only known what vaccines can do, and have done, I may have reconsidered, so I thank you for putting out so much information on this. I didn't know at the time what may have happened, but I will do what I have to do to save another life. THANK YOU! (Our son's life: July 7th 1998 to August 30th 1998.)\n  A. I am sorry to hear your story. The Hepatitis B vaccine is damaging and killing many babies, yet authorities continue to deny this. Best wishes on your grief and healing. Thanks for sharing your story and supporting our efforts to inform other parents.\n     Q. Dear thinktwice, I am writing to you about my experience with the Hepatitis B vaccine. I am from Russia, where they do not have Hepatitis B vaccines. When I came to America, I was \"required\" to have the vaccine in order to attend school or summer camps. So I received it at the age of 14. I had developed optic neuritis and by my 15th birthday, I had become blind. Not only was this a complete shock, but it was very painful since my optic nerve had swollen so much. To make matters worse, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.\n   The medical community is quick to deny any relations of my MS to the vaccines. But both sides of my family are very healthy. There is not a single case of MS or any neurological illnesses in my family. We also never have had diabetes, cancer or heart diseases. My advice to all parents is PROTECT PROTECT PROTECT your children from vaccines, especially Hepatitis B. To those who are struggling with the outcomes of vaccines, all I can tell you is that there is hope and our merciful and just God hears you.\n  A. Thanks for sharing your story. We'll post it for others to read.\n","227":" MMR Studies \n Watch this 6-minute Video on MMR \n MMR is an abbreviation for measles, mumps, and rubella -- three common childhood illnesses up until the mid-1970s. Vaccines are available for each of these diseases. However, in the 1980s they were combined into a single \"three-in-one\" MMR shot.\n  How is the MMR vaccine made?\n According to the U.S. manufacturer, Merck & Company, Inc., the current MMR vaccine -- MMR-II -- contains attenuated live measles and mumps viruses propagated in chick embryo cell culture, plus \"the Wistar RA 27\/3 strain of live attenuated rubella virus propagated in WI-38 human diploid lung fibroblasts.\"(1) Principal studies published in the American Journal of Diseases of Children and the American Journal of Epidemiology, reveal that the rubella strain was cultured from an aborted human fetus.(2,3) In addition, the growth medium for the three live viruses that are needed to produce the MMR vaccine is a buffered salt solution \"supplemented with fetal bovine serum.\"(4) Other ingredients include sucrose, phosphate, glutamate, recombinant human albumin, sorbitol, hydrolyzed gelatin stabilizer, and approximately 25 mcg of neomycin (an antibiotic).(5) The MMR vaccine does not contain a preservative. In fact, according to the FDA,  MMR-II never contained thimerosal, a potentially dangerous chemical used in some vaccines.(6) However, trace amounts of mercury were detected in an earlier MMR formulation.(7)\n  How safe is the MMR vaccine?\n The drug company that makes the MMR vaccine publishes an extensive list of warnings, contraindications, and adverse reactions associated with this triple shot. These may be found in the vaccine package insert available from any doctor giving MMR, and in the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR) at the library.(8,9) The following afflictions affecting nearly every body system -- blood, lymphatic, digestive, cardiovascular, immune, nervous, respiratory, and sensory -- have been reported following receipt of the MMR shot: encephalitis, encephalopathy, neurological disorders, seizure disorders, convulsions, learning disabilities, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), demyelination of the nerve sheaths, Guillain-Barre' syndrome (paralysis), muscle incoordination, deafness, panniculitis, vasculitis, optic neuritis (including partial or total blindness), retinitis, otitis media, bronchial spasms, fever, headache, joint pain, arthritis (acute and chronic), transverse myelitis, thrombocytopenia (blood clotting disorders and spontaneous bleeding), anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions), lymphadenopathy, leukocytosis, pneumonitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, urticaria, pancreatitis, parotitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, meningitis, diabetes, autism, immune system disorders, and death (Figure 49).(10,11)\n  How effective is the MMR vaccine?\n Prior to the introduction of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines, thousands of cases of measles, mumps and rubella occurred every year. Today, these numbers are greatly reduced. However, unlike the natural diseases, the MMR vaccine does not confer permanent immunity. For example, measles epidemics regularly occur in vaccinated populations. According to the CDC, \"measles transmission has been clearly documented among vaccinated persons. In some large outbreaks...over 95 percent of cases have a history of vaccination.\"(13) Outbreaks of mumps and rubella often occur in vaccinated people as well.(14) Evidently, immunity is short-lived. The Journal of the America Medical Association published data showing that antibody levels after rubella vaccinations fell to half their high point within four years.(15) The medical literature contains many examples of MMR vaccine failures. Thus, people who receive MMR may still be susceptible to the three diseases.\n  In a study conducted by scientists from the Direct Health 2000 clinic in Eltham, South London, England, half of all children vaccinated with MMR were found to have \"zero or very low immunity\" against measles and mumps. According to Dr. Sarah Dean, who oversaw the study, \"This means there could be a lot of children who think they have got the umbrella protection\" yet remain at risk. Dean believes that young children's immune systems cannot cope with more than one virus at a time.(16) Yet, a second dose of MMR was added to immunization schedules.\n  The British Medical Journal published a survey of doctor's and nurse's attitudes toward booster doses of MMR. Fifty-one percent of all U.K. doctors and nurses had reservations about or disagreed with the policy of giving an MMR booster shot, and 80 percent of all U.K. doctors would not \"unequivocally recommend\" the second dose to a wavering parent (Figure 50).(17)\n  Many parents report that their perfectly healthy children became autistic after receiving the MMR vaccine. The affected children were developing normally, then regressed after receiving the triple shot, losing their previously acquired skills. The medical community vociferously denies any connection between the MMR vaccine and autism. However, in 1998 Lancet published a landmark study by Dr. Andrew Wakefield linking the onset of autistic symptoms to the MMR vaccine.(21) Wakefield and his world-class team of medical experts investigated previously normal children who subsequently suffered from intestinal abnormalities and regressive developmental disorder, including a loss of acquired skills. In most cases, \"onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation.\"(22) Further research uncovered a possible explanation:\n\"Atypical patterns of exposure to common childhood infections -- measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox -- have been associated with autism and autistic regression.... A close temporal relationship in the exposure to two of these infections during periods of susceptibility may compound both the risk and severity of autism.... Although historically, these rare patterns of exposure may have accounted for only a small proportion of autism, the widespread use of a combination of the candidate agents in a single vaccine [MMR] may have changed this.\"(23)\n An earlier study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology identified in utero and infant exposures as periods of apparent susceptibility, when both the brain and immune system are undergoing rapid development.(24) Thus, fetuses and young children are especially prone to adverse consequences if they contract two or more viral infections concurrently. Wakefield elaborated on the increased perils of being exposed to more than one virus at a time:\n\"One important pattern of infection that may increase the risk of delayed disease is where different viruses interact, either with each other or both interact with the host immune system simultaneously. Virologic data support the possibility of a compound effect of multiple concurrent viral exposures influencing...the risk of autism.\"(25)\n Is it safer to receive MMR as three separate shots?\n Dr. Wakefield theorized that if a child who is exposed to two or more wild viral infections around the same time is at increased risk for autism, then a child who is injected with three live viruses via the MMR vaccine is equally susceptible to the ailment, if not more so. Thus, Wakefield proposed separating the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines from the three-in-one MMR shot -- the way they were in the 1970s prior to being combined -- and administering them individually over the course of several weeks or months. His solution would satisfy immunization recommendations designed to protect against the three diseases while safeguarding against the risk of autism:\n\"If, following thorough independent scientific investigation, it emerges that autistic...disorders are causally related to a compound influence of the component viruses of MMR, whether these viruses have been encountered naturally or in the vaccine, then through judicious use of the vaccines, one may have a means for preventing the disease [autism]. Spacing the single vaccines, thereby dissociating the exposures that, together, may constitute the risk, provides a way of not only preventing the acute measles, mumps and rubella infections, but also, potentially, the risk of one of the most devastating diseases that it has been our misfortune to encounter.\"(26)\n For families that elect to vaccinate their children, Wakefield's proposal to separate the shots seems like a prudent approach, especially since recipients of MMR are being injected with three different live viruses -- contained within a chemical mixture of three diverse and potent drugs -- all at once. Furthermore, the medical and scientific literature contains documentation linking the MMR vaccine to a multitude of serious adverse reactions. The MMR vaccine manufacturer, plus numerous unsolicited personal stories, confirm the tragic possibilities.(27) Thus, when Wakefield's research was first publicized, concerned parents quickly rejected the MMR vaccine and demanded instead the individual shots. Several doctors initially supported Wakefield's recommendation and complied with their clients' requests. However, the individual measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are capable of causing severe adverse reactions as well. These are also listed by the vaccine manufacturer and documented in numerous studies.(28)\n  MMR was initially administered as three separate shots, rarely at the same time. Thus, early reports of adverse consequences could be attributed to a particular vaccine. Later, when the three-in-one MMR vaccine replaced the individual vaccines it became much more difficult to link a bad reaction to either the measles, mumps, or rubella portions of the shot. Today, MMR is often given in combination with other vaccines as well, making it even more difficult to determine whether one vaccine in particular caused an adverse reaction, or if all of the vaccines given at once simply overwhelmed the recipient's immune system.\n  Note: In January 2010, a British medical panel concluded that Dr. Wakefield had violated ethics rules, prompting The Lancet to retract his 1998 research paper which suggested that MMR may be linked to autism. However, according to Wakefield, \"the allegations against me and my colleagues are both unfounded and unjust and I invite anyone to examine the contents of these proceedings and come to their own conclusion.\"\n   Listen to Dr. Andrew Wakefield In His Own Words.\n  Why are the three vaccines combined?\n The three vaccines -- measles, mumps and rubella -- are combined into a single shot for convenience, not safety or efficacy. In fact, when 180 Swiss physicians analyzed 320 scientific works from around the world, they concluded that... \n The information on this webpage was excerpted from...\n  352 Pages \/ Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2015 \/ All Rights Reserved.\n (All citations are included in the book.) \n   This section contains unsolicited adverse reaction reports associated with the MMR vaccine. They are typical of the daily emails received by the Thinktwice Global Vaccine Institute.\n  [MMR114] My 12-month-old received his MMR shot on a Friday. The following Friday he had a 104 degree temperature and became violently ill. The doctor said it was a stomach virus. But on Monday morning he woke up with a rash all over. I took him to the doctor and was very upset to learn that this is very common.\n  [MMR128] Recently, my 13-month-old had his MMR. He now has constant high fevers and seizures, which he never had. He is a totally different boy. This is devastating.\n   [MMR176] My friend's 15-month-old daughter received an MMR vaccine. Within eight days she was hospitalized with a 104 degree fever and a skin rash. My friend called to see what I could find out about Stevens-Johnson syndrome. They told her that her daughter may die as a result of this.\n  [MMR203] A dear friend lost her 15-month old daughter two weeks after her MMR. She was healthy and showed no signs of illness yet died suddenly in her sleep one afternoon. The post mortem revealed a viral infection and traces of pneumonia, but her mother and I find it very hard to believe that the vaccination wasn't to blame.\n    [MMR216] Three days ago my friend's 15-month-old daughter was hospitalized after experiencing a high fever and her first seizure. The hospital put the baby through a series of tests, including a CAT scan and CBC. My friend told me he thought it was a reaction to the MMR vaccine she recently received. However, the doctors were puzzled as to the cause and disallowed this explanation.\n   [MMR315] When my daughter was just over one year old, she received her MMR vaccination. Later that day she had a high fever, and I put her to bed. I was busy doing housework downstairs and got this \"mother's intuition\" that something was wrong. I rushed upstairs to find her blue and not breathing. I called a nurse. My daughter seemed to be convulsing, so I was instructed to reach down her throat to open her air passage. She was rushed to the hospital and they immediately put her into a cool bath. She was in the hospital for almost a week. Had it not been for my gut feeling that something was wrong, my baby would not be with me today.\n   [MMR317] Our son developed seizures after his MMR vaccine at 14 months. Today, after two years of anti-epilepsy medications, he has totally regressed. We decided to stop all medications five weeks ago and his grand mal fits have stopped. We are now left with a child experiencing severe constipation and bowel problems.\n   [MMR321] One week after the MMR shot for my 16-month-old daughter, she had diarrhea. The next day she had three seizures. What steps should be taken once a reaction has occurred. I want to be sure it is documented and the government is made aware.\n   [MMR398] My daughter had a serious reaction to the MMR shot when she was 22 months. She developed brain damage after a fever of 106 degrees. She also has seizures which are unresponsive to medication, damage to the nerves of her eyes, and learning disabilities that she battles every day. We took her case to court and lost. The doctor who testified on their behalf stated that the government only called him in when they wanted a finding in their favor. What a setup! Of course they don't have to live with the frustrations and expense of raising these vaccine-damaged children.\n   [MMR402] Three days after my daughter received her MMR vaccine, she started blinking her eyes and sniffling a lot. She's been doing this for 2 1\/2 months now. Is there a link between the MMR vaccine and facial tics?\n   [MMR436] My 12-year-old had a seizure within 10 minutes of his second MMR. His head rolled side to side and his arms jerked a couple of times. He was unaware of this, so he must have blanked out. Afterwards, he felt woozy, very tired, and had a headache at the bridge of his nose. Also, his arm that got the shot was numb. The feeling in it gradually returned over the course of an hour.\n   [MMR443] I have a 15-year-old daughter. I recently moved to the U.S. from the U.K. without her medical records. Upon arrival we were required to give her complete immunizations. I strongly objected, but felt pushed into re-immunization because of state laws to get her into school. After her second MMR she has been complaining of dizzy spells and continuous headaches. Is there a link between over-immunization of MMR and this sickness?\n   [MMR509] Today, shortly after I was inoculated with the MMR vaccine, I began feeling faint and short of breath. After ten minutes of holding my head between my knees in a dirty gas station bathroom, I decided I could drive the 20 miles home.\n   [MMR518] I had an MMR shot about three year ago and have suffered from many reactions to this vaccine since.\n   [MMR552] When I was a child I was given the MMR vaccine. Almost seven days to the hour I became ill: fever, sweats, throwing up even the slightest amount of fluid or food. This went on for a month or so. The doctors would not even consider that the shots caused the illness. Later, they wanted me to have the second MMR; my parents refused. The doctors went through the usual tantrums and said I wouldn't be able to attend school. When my parents said 'Fine, he won't go,' the doctors gave in. At about the age of 18, I had a blood screening and was told I didn't have all of the MMR vaccine. Forgetting the episode as a child, I let them give me the shot. Seven days later I was sick again, but not as severe.\n   [MMR580] My college refused to admit me without an MMR vaccine. I had a terrible reaction and was rushed to the hospital with piercing screams, a high temperature and delirium. Now I have trouble focusing, and can be scattered and forgetful. I can't stand change and don't seem to have the energy and drive that I once had. My family thinks I developed obsessive-compulsive disorder. I am very bright, but nearly blew my scholarship after the shot.\n   [MMR588] I was told by the nursing school where I am enrolled, \"No vaccine, no school.\" Even though I had all the normal vaccines as a child, I was unable to show this. Five days after I received the MMR vaccine, I was so ill that I ended up in the emergency room. The doctor told me that the MMR did not cause my sickness, and my nursing school supervisor said it was a virus. Why does the medical establishment deny vaccine reactions? Why can't they tell us this important information and let us make educated responsible decisions. The irony is that I got the vaccine and now I'm so sick that I can't go to school.\nThe most extensive, up-to-date information on the MMR vaccine\n may be found in the book: Vaccine Safety Manual \n    This incredible reference book is the world's most complete guide to immunization risks and protection. It includes pertinent information on every major vaccine: polio, tetanus, MMR, hepatitis A, B, HPV (cervical cancer), Hib, Flu, chickenpox, shingles, rotavirus, pneumococcal, meningococcal, RSV, DTaP, anthrax, smallpox, TB, and more.

In some areas known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mad dog disease\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because the transmission of the disease is frequently associated with bites by infected dogs. Hydrophobia is the commonest name and relates to the major symptom.\nGeographical Distribution;\nThis disease is endemic in most areas of the world but is very common in the tropics where control of animals is limited. A few island countries are free of the disease.\nCausative Agent;\nThe disease is caused by an RNA virus of the rhabdovirus group which has a long incubation period.\nTransmission;\nThe major source of infection is through the bite of an infected animal. Any warm blooded animal may be capable of transmitting the disease through their infected saliva. A few cases of airborne transmission have been reported. Congenital transmission is known to occur in some animals but human cases have not be shown. Again injestion of infected meat has been known to cause the disease in animals but not man. Human to human spread is possible in theory but has not been reported to date. All ages are at equal risk.\nDisease Cycle;\nFollowing an infected bite the virus is placed under the skin surface. Here the virus multiplies for a period of days or weeks. It then travels along the peripheral nerves and via the axons to the dorsal root ganglia. Here further multiplication of the virus occurs. The virus passes to the central nervous system and is capable of passing from cell to cell. The final path of its journey takes it back along axons to the salivary glands and many other deep organs eg heart, skeletal tissue, kidney, cornea etc. The extent of the viraemia caused is minimal. By escaping into the saliva the virus is transmissible to another host through inoculation. Anywhere between 3 days and 3 years. Most commonly between 1 to 3 months. The incubation period is directly related to the extent of the inoculation and the closeness of the brain. Thus bites on the face and neck are particularly significant and will, in general, be associated with a short incubation period.\nSymptoms & Signs;\nIn many patients no symptoms occur until the final days of the disease are reached. The site of the initial inoculation will usually have fully healed and be well forgotten. When the patient begins to experience the first effects of the disease frequently they will experience fever and headaches. They then may relate a numbness at the site of the original bite. The ankle is the most common site. Following this patients complain of anxiety, photophobia and muscular pains. Patients may then fall into one of two categories;\nFurious Rabies: This is the most common variety (80%). The patients experience severe muscular spasms which may lead to apnoea, if the respiratory muscles are involved. The patients tend to develop spasm of the pharyngeal muscles which is precipitated by swallowing, cold drafts across the neck or movement. The fear of swallowing leads to an unwillingness to swallow their own saliva (hydrophobia) and saliva continually drips from the corners of their mouth.\nParalytic Rabies: Less common variety in man. Death may be delayed but always occurs. Patients tend to lie quietly and because of the gross hypersalivation, saliva dribbles from their mouths. Some patients with furious rabies may have periods of paralytic symptoms.\nDiagnosis & Treatment;\nThere is no firm way of making the diagnosis before the symptoms\/signs first appear. Corneal impression smears may be of some value early into the symptomatic stage of the disease showing the virus by antibody techniques. Serodiagnosis is only of value after the appearance of signs, when no therapy can be instigated. Post mortum diagnosis (for animals or man) can be made by taking cerebral tissue and finding the typical Negri bodies and an encephalomyelitis. Only supportive humanitarian measures are available; Valium Analgesia Intravenous fluids Atropine\nProphylaxis;\nThis is the most important aspect of dealing with rabies from a human point of view. The prophylactic regimes vary from centre to centre. In most areas a human diploid vaccine is used (HDCV) or a vero vaccine. In many of the developing countries the older animal vaccine is used with its inherent risks.\nPre Exposure Vaccination: Rabies (HDCV) may be used to confer antibody protection to individuals before they are infected. The vaccine is given on three occasions over a 3 to 4 week period. This is believed to provide excellent cover for about 3 years.\nAt the time of Exposure: The bite should be well washed with water to remove as much saliva as possible from the area. If soap is used at this stage it must be well washed off before an antiseptic is applied to the area. The area should then be covered and the patient should have post exposure vaccination as soon as possible.\nPost Exposure Vaccination: ALL PATIENTS MUST OBTAIN SPECIALISED MEDICAL ATTENTION AND THE NOTES BELOW SHOULD ONLY BE USED AS AN OUTLINE.\nActive and passive immunisation can be used. In severe proximal bites both should be administered as soon as possible following inoculation. The hyperimmune serum (passive) can be injected mainly at the site of inoculation and whatever is left by the intramuscular route separate to where the active vaccine is to be administered. The vaccine (HDCV) is given by the intramuscular route on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 30 and 90. It is a very effective vaccine but the cost limits it use in the developing parts of our world where transmission is highest. In these areas it has been shown that by using the intradermal route effectiveness can be reached without the immense costs involved.\nComments;\nNumerous attempts are going on throughout the world to lessen the spread of this horrific disease. The major upsurge in Europe recently has been associated with the spread of the disease by foxes. Any warm blooded animal can carry the virus. Almost all are themselves killed by the disease and so following a bite if the animal survives a period of 10 days it may be taken that it was not rabid at the time of the bite.\nWHO Recommendations: 2002\nRabies post-exposure treatment\nIn a rabies-endemic area, the circumstances of an animal bite, other contact with the animal, and the animal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour and appearance may suggest that it is rabid. In such situations, medical advice should be obtained immediately. Post-exposure treatment to prevent the establishment of rabies infection involves first-aid treatment of the wound followed by administration of rabies vaccine and antirabies immunoglobulin in the case of class 3 exposure. The administration of vaccine, and immunoglobulin if required, must be carried out, or directly supervised, by a physician. Post-exposure treatment depends on the type of contact with the confirmed or suspect rabid animal, as follows:\nType of contact (class of exposure)\nRecommended treatment\n1 \/ Touching or feeding animals, Licks on the skin\n2 \/ Nibbling unbroken skin, Minor scratches without bleeding, Licks on broken skin\nAdminister vaccine immediately (1)\n3 \/ Single or multiple bites or scratches with skin penetration, Contamination of mucous membrane by saliva from licking\nAdminister antirabies immunoglobulin and vaccine immediately\nFirst-aid treatment\nSince elimination of the rabies virus at the site of infection by chemical or physical means is the most effective mechanism of protection, immediate vigorous washing and flushing with soap or detergent and water, or water alone, is imperative. Following washing, apply either ethanol (70%) or tincture or aqueous solution of iodine or povidone iodine.\nSpecific treatment\nAntirabies immunoglobulin (RIG) is applied by instillation into the depth of the wound and by infiltration of the surrounding tissues. As much as possible of the total RIG volume required should be instilled into the wound. Vaccine (2) is applied by intradermal or intra-muscular injection in schedules requiring several doses (4 or 5 doses by intramuscular injection, depending on the vaccine used), with the first dose being administered as soon as possible after exposure and the last dose within 28 days for intramuscular or 90 days for intradermal vaccination.\nPatients who have been vaccinated prophylactically against rabies with a full course of cell-culture or duck-embryo vaccine can be given a shorter course of post-exposure treatment with fewer doses; they do not require RIG. Urgent post-exposure treatment remains essential whether or not patients have been previously vaccinated.\n1 Treatment can be stopped if the suspect animal is shown by appropriate laboratory examination to be free of rabies or, in the case of domestic dogs and cats, if the animal remains healthy throughout a 10-day observation period.\n2 Modern rabies vaccines, made from cell-culture or duck-embryo-derived rabies virus which is then purified and inactivated, are replacing the older vaccines produced in brain tissue.\n","229":"When travelling outside Canada, you may be at risk for a number of vaccine preventable illnesses. \nYou should consult a health care provider or visit a travel health clinic preferably six weeks before you travel.

You should also get protected from\u00c2\u00a0chickenpox\u00c2\u00a0either through vaccination or a prior case of chickenpox.\nMany adults also need a\u00c2\u00a0pneumonia\u00c2\u00a0vaccine; travelers who smoke, have asthma, diabetes, other chronic health problems, or are over age 65 need protection with a pneumonia vaccine.\nHepatitis A\u00c2\u00a0vaccine is recommended for all travelers to the Dominican\u00c2\u00a0Republic.\nYou may want to consider\u00c2\u00a0typhoid\u00c2\u00a0vaccine if you will be leaving the resorts for more rustic eateries or visiting local residents.\nHepatitis B\u00c2\u00a0is recommend for prolonged stays, those who may need health care while in the Dominican Republic. People who anticipate contact with body secretions such as tattooing, dental work, or new sexual partners should also get protected.\nRabies\u00c2\u00a0vaccine is rarely, if ever, needed for travel to the resorts, your travel medicine provider can discuss whether this is right for you.\nMany travelers are surprised to find out the CDC recommends protection from\u00c2\u00a0malaria\u00c2\u00a0in most of the Dominican Republic, including the coastal resorts (yes, even Punta Cana)\nDengue\u00c2\u00a0is also spread by mosquitoes. The only way to prevent\u00c2\u00a0dengue\u00c2\u00a0is wear effective insect repellents during the day. Personally I prefer 20% Picardin as it is odorless and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t harm the synthetic fabrics found in bathing suits.\nDiscuss how to prevent\u00c2\u00a0traveler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diarrhea\u00c2\u00a0(TD) with your doctor. TD is always caused by eating or drinking contaminated food and water. It is less common in the resorts in the Dominican Republic than is in the more rustic areas of the island.\u00c2\u00a0 Careful hand washing and attention to detail when selecting food and beverages minimizes your chance of suffering from TD.\nCholera\u00c2\u00a0is a severe bacterial intestinal infection which is spread by contaminated water, both fresh water and salt water. It originated in neighboring Haiti, and has on occasion sickened tourists. One particularly nasty outbreak was associated with eating\u00c2\u00a0shrimp\u00c2\u00a0at a wedding. Again,\u00c2\u00a0mindful\u00c2\u00a0food and beverage choices minimizes your chance of contracting this.\nRemember, risky behaviors are risky everywhere. Resist the urge to get a new tattoo or piercing. And always use\u00c2\u00a0safer sex\u00c2\u00a0practices, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want you coming home with new viruses (HIV) or other hard to treat problems.\nAccidents. All this discussion about infections belies the fact that your biggest health risk is the automobile, same as it is in the USA. Look both ways before you cross the street and buckle up when you are in the car. Better yet, take a break from the car with a walk on the beach or take a nap under the palm trees.\nA relaxing getaway to the Dominican Republic can be just the thing to chase away the winter blahs. \u00c2\u00a0A few simple protective measures can make the difference between lovely memories of a tropical vacation and vivid memories of an unpleasant infection.\u00c2\u00a0 Your local\u00c2\u00a0travel medicine provider\u00c2\u00a0is happy to help you prepare for a relaxing, memorable vacation in the sun.\nSure, its possible to go places and not get sick. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just recommended that you protect yourself to minimze the chance you will become ill, especially when the illnesses are awful. You put a seatbelt on when you get in a car to protect yourself;  most of the time you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a seatbelt\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.but if you are in an accident you REALLY need it, and by that time it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late to put one on. Talk to anyone who has contracted any of the diseases which can be prevented by vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they wish they hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contracted the illness. So I recommend you talk to your doctor to see what is recommended for you.\n","231":" the cost of the injection isn't really an issue for me.... but to be honest i really really really hate getting injections and the rabies one is a course of three!!\n so as long as i'm carful (no patting street dogs\/ no playing with monkeys) do i really need it?\nFor me, it was the cost AND the needles that meant I didn't get the rabies vaccination. I was advised that as long as you're never more than half a day away from good medical care, and you're not going to be exposing yourself to unneccesary risk, then you'll probably be fine without it... and I guess the travel nurse was right, because I don't have rabies...!\nIs it worth it?  It will be if you are bitten.  What are the chances of being bitten?  Probably pretty slim.\n Avoid dogs, avoid monkeys, avoid bats - and you will most likely be fine.  But it's a risk and one that you have to make an informed decision on. If you don't care about the cost, then get it for the peace of mind.  They are only little injections and don't hurt at all.  The thought of them is worse than the actual injection.\n Maybe do a bit of google search to see where there are any current outbreaks and take that into consideration - but also take it with a grain of salt.  For example, there has been a recent outbreak in Bali (ie a year or so ago, presumably still ongoing) but it's pretty much localised to one village area in the NW corner of the island, last I heard, in an area not typically visited by tourists.\n If I were you, I would perhaps be more concerned about getting Hep A and B if anything, and make sure your tetanus is up to date.  Then go and buy some mozzie repellant to reduce the risk of dengue fever.\nHow many jabs do you get? I for one stay the hell away from the cute monkeys. One is cute and then mamma or poppa monkey get upset. I have seen it. So pics are good enough for me, no petting. I have had a couple of bad experiences with stray dogs, but in general the dogs wagging their tails hanging around the locals are usually fed by them and not \"dangerous\" if treated kindly. Now surprising dogs who are guarding their territory at night almost got me in serious trouble. But after all my SE ASia trvaels I still probably wouldn't get rabies shots if it means I still need to go to the doc for more shots if bitten. As was said, get that Hep stuff and a tetanus booster. Watch the mozzies and maybe a typhoid shot.\n AND DON\"T FORGET TRAVEL INSURANCE....that is the one that screws people the most.\nHey Somtam  - 200 dead?  Wow!  Is it now spreading to other parts of Bali?\n Hamish - you need to get 3 injections.  They are little ones.  (Look - Somtam's young kids managed, I'm sure you can too!)  I'll post some info below from a NZ medical website.  I am not trying to be alarmist, and I'm not advocating getting the injections one way or another.  But I do believe in making informed decisions after weighing up the risks.  Your comments indicate you aren't overly informed about rabies and what's involved if you are bittn.\n Once symptoms develop, death is inevitable in all cases. There is no cure. Treatment consists of first aid management to the initial wound and then and vaccine administered promptly following exposure, and before symptoms develop. This vaccine may have to be given together with a specialised human immunoglobulin immunisation at the first visit following exposure to rabies.\n Vigorously wash and flush the wound site with soap and water, OR detergent OR water alone. This is important.Apply either ethanol OR tincture or aqueous solution of iodine.Seek the advice of local medical authorities, informing them of any vaccine you have already had.If possible, take the name and address of the owner of the animal or get the local police to trace the animal urgently.If possible, try and find out if the animal is healthy and if vaccinated against rabies.\n There are two vaccine administration regimes depending on whether the person has had pre-exposure immunisation ( see Vaccination below ).\n From what I understand the Rabies Immunoglobulin injection is particularly awful - I think it needs to go directly into the wound.\n Again, I'm not trying to be alarmist.  But just make sure you have valid reasons for getting, or not getting, the vaccinations.\n \"i here it only gives you an extra 24 hours to get to a hospital if you are bitten etc... \"\n That's not entirely true. The time you have depends on where the exposure occurs on your body. Head and neck exposure requires treatment much sooner than when exposure occurs, for example, on the arms or legs. This is because the virus has to travel to the brain in order to manifest itself, and that can take up to a month. For head and neck exposures, one can be good for up to a week, but it's better to begin treatment not much later than 24 hours after exposure.\n Also, with regards to costs, the vaccine and RIG are significantly less expensive in SEA than they are here in Canada. WAY less.\n The RIG is supposed to be administered into the place of exposure, but this rarely happens. Most of the time it is given in the area of exposure.\n The 5 shots of vaccine have to be given over the period of 28 days (Day 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28) which means you have to stick around or continue with the shots in a different place. If the series is not completed, the process will fail. We deal with people who have been bitten overseas, received the RIG and the first 2 or 3 shots of vaccine, then provide them with the remainders.\nI was bitten by a bat several years ago, on my right leg, and received the full five shots.  Thank heavens, no longer done in the stomach, but alternating shoulders.  Also was given the immuoglobulin injection.  As Bizzylizzy said, it had to go in near (though not at) the location of the bite.  For me, it wasn't as painful as the actual rabies vaccine jabs, but because it was done on my leg, it was uncomfortably close to the leg bone.\n My understanding about the vaccine is that, even if, like me, you've had the full round of injections, additional are required if you are exposed again (bitten, that is).  Two more, as noted by others.  But I also understand it doesn't have to happen immediately, especially if bitten on an extremity.  In other words, not necessarily within 24 hours.  Still, if bitten, or you think you were somehow exposed, I wouldn't dawdle on my way to proper medical care.\n","232":"I am traveling for around 3 -6 months to Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. Pre-exposure immunization for rabies in Australia is very expensive and I read that it can save hundreds of dollars to receive the three injections in countries where rabies is common due to demand.\nI work in healthcare, but wouldn't consider myself an authority on this particular question by any means. I would consult a reputable travel clinic and follow their advice. You need to consider how likely you are to come in contact with an infected animal, and I would consider each one infected, unless you know otherwise. I'd say that vaccination is like insurance - and, as Australian Government suggests, if you cannot afford travel insurance, you cannot afford to travel... I'm not sure how much you were quoted for the course of vaccines, however, little research has turned up this site thetraveldoctor.com.au\/blog\/rabies_vaccine\/, which suggests that it might be quite reasonable (I suppose it would be a bit more now than in 2012, when it was written). \n\"I want to stay away from Bangkok as they will be under a 60 day state of emergency when I arrive there and tourists have been told to exercise extreme caution.\"\nMick, there is an excellent post that is currently going on in the Bangkok forum about this very matter. I would highly recommend you read ALL the posts on it. The Thai government issuing a 60 day state of emergency is nothing like issuing a state of emergency here in Australia. Here is a short narrative from many of the posts there: \n\"The State of Emergency is so far more of a preemptive measure than something that needs to be a subject of immediate concern. It gives the government the right to use security forces to disperse gatherings, ban marches and enforce a curfew.\"\nI have only last week returned from 2 weeks in Thailand. I spent most of that time in Bangkok and am a regular visitor there. Bangkok is a massive city. Much, much bigger than Melbourne. As a tourist, is was very easy to avoid the demonstrators. To be honest, I did not see any thing different there than any other time i visited.\nAlso, the Australian Government, to my knowledge, has always advised people to exercise extreme caution whilst visiting Bangkok. This has not changed. Obviously as a tourist, you should not go looking for these demonstrations and just do your normal every day thing.\nAdmittedly, although I have been traveling around Asia for many years, including several years actually living in an Asian country, having rabies immunization never occurred to me nor was it ever recommended by any do for I visited, either here or in Asia. We didn't go round petting animals, especially dogs and monkeys, and we didn't keep pets when we lived there. \nHowever, I understand why the OP my want the pre immunisation rabies vaccine. But, if you are so concerned then I wouldn't have thought that cost would be an issue. You are aware that it is a course of 3 shots over a month? Will you be in one place for that long? If not (and you are so worried) how will you protect yourself during that month? \nYou cannot always prevent bites- sometimes it s just wrong place, wrong animal. \nMy 17 year old daughter is currently undergoing the course of rabies vaccinations; she has had 2 shots and has the 3rd in 2 weeks time. She is travelling to Kenya in March with her school. I wanted to ensure she had all the required shots, and as her GP couldn't give the Yellow Fever vaccination, I took my pharmacists advice and took her to a travel clinic.\nReally glad I did that. She has been able to get what she needs there. They did have the rabies vaccine available, even though there is a shortage. Yes, it is expensive, $110. per shot, although we are able to claim some of this through our health insurance.\nThe doctor we saw said that as they are a travel clinic they do offer a cheaper option for those who don't want to or can't pay that amount. One evening each week they held a clinic with rabies vaccinations for ( I think) $40. per shot. The difference (and I might not have this completely right) was the vaccine is not as strong and is injected just into the skin, as opposed into muscle. You still have 3 shots, but then have to return for a skin test to see if it has worked.\n","233":"Hi all, first time traveling to Belize in the next few weeks with my husband. Will be there for 10 days. I am hearing mixed opinions on whether vaccines are necessary or not. My friend who went last year said yes, I think instead of vaccine she took malaria pills, travel agent said no, CDC says yes on website, doctor said no. Would love to know what you all think. We are spending 5 nights at Ka'ana and 5 nights at Matachica on Ambergris Caye. Please advise. And if you have any must do activities, would appreciate that too....\nThanks!!!\nI'm frankly amazed that your MD would not go along with the CDC recommendation. Malaria is easy to prevent and the dickens to cure, so why not take the pills? Malaria is present in the country, especially away from the coast, and if you're lucky you won't get it. Feeling lucky?\nBy the way, we are supposed to berate you for seeking medical advice on the internet, but since you already talked to your MD, you're OK. Now you'll hear a lot of contradictory advice from the forum.\nFrankly, I'd be changing physicians. The CDC is very conservative, but, pretty much every physician I know goes by their recommendations. And, I used to be a nurse in a pediatric clinic that gave travel vaccines.\nI just returned from Nicaragua and Belize. We took anti-malarials for Nicaragua, but, didn't take them for Belize, we were just on Ambergris. We probably will take them this winter when we head to Chan Chich on the mainland.\nHave you been vaccinated against Hepatitis A & B? You really only have time for the first injection in the series, but, you will have partial protection from that. Hepatitis A is endemic in all of Central America, I simply can't fathom a physician not recommending being vaccinated against it.\nSounds like a smart doctor since some of the drugs can have much worse side effects than the disease - maybe they'd been to Belize before. It's extremely rare here, and it's the vivax strain, so it's easily curable. Some like to err on the side of caution, of course. I'd listen to your doctor.\nMalaria\nThe number of cases of malaria in Belize has fallen significantly over the past several years, from more than 1000 cases per year prior to 2006 to less than 100 per year in the past two years -- 79 cases in 2011 and 33 cases in 2012 (up to 1 November, and 25 of those 33 were in Stann Creek District).\nIt basically depends where you intend to travel and your level of risk. San Pedro would be lower risk than small remote villages in the south of the country.\nSome of the ways you can reduce the risk: sleeping in screened rooms, covering up during peak biting times, wearing repellent and removing any standing water which provides a breeding ground for mosquitoes.\nThe other disease you should be aware of is dengue fever. It is transmitted by some species of mosquito, and since there is no prophylactic, it's more important that prevention is sought by reducing the habitat and the number of mosquitoes and limiting exposure to bites.\nThe number of dengue cases has varied greatly over the years because dengue cases tend to arise from outbreaks. In most years, the number of cases per year is less than 50, but in 2005, 2009 & 2010, cases numbered in the several hundreds. If I remember correctly, outbreaks have occurred in Caye Caulker, Corozal, Orange Walk as well as other regions of Belize, so this is a disease that does not just occur in smaller remote villages. Since 1998, there have been no deaths from dengue.\nOther Shots\nThere may be no requirements for any shots before you enter Belize, but again it's up to you to assess your own risk. Tetanus & hepatitis shots are something you should have anyway, wherever you live. FOR ME -- I wouldn't get typhoid, diptheria, cholera or yellow fever, but your case might be different.\nIn the US, I don't think you can get tetanus without getting diphtheria. All the vaccines I've seen have had both.\nDukoral was initially introduced as a cholera vaccine. It's not available in the US. I've never heard of other cholera vaccines being available, but, I've been retired for three years.\nYellow fever isn't recommended for Belize. If you're traveling to an area that has yellow fever, you really need to get vaccinated. Many countries won't allow you inside their borders if you're coming from a yellow fever area without proof of being vaccinated. And, proof is the yellow card with an official stamp. Not just a copy of your immunization record.\nI keep my typhoid vaccine status current, but, not really for travel to Belize.\nI'm so torn and confused. Thanks for your input but what is the final verdict? I am travelling from NYC.\nThe final verdict should be between you and a physician who knows something about travel medicine. After speaking with someone knowledgeable, it will be up to you to decide on the level of risk that you're willing to take.\nIt's a trade off, the anti-malarials do have side effects, although neither Cholorquine or Malarone have ever bothered me.\nI personally think everyone should be vaccinated against Hepatitis A & B. Both diseases are out there, outbreaks of Hepatitis A happen in the US. Several people died from it in Pittsburgh not too many years ago.\nEveryone should also keep their tetanus up to date. And, now, there's an adult form that also prevents pertussis (whooping cough). Pertussis isn't a serious disease for healthy adults (but coughing for up to three months isn't fun). However, it kills infants. So, if you're due for a tetanus booster, get one with pertussis included: TDaP.\nHave a look at this website www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk This is the one we're advised to check out in the UK. We also have to book an appointment with the nurse at the GP surgery, complete a form on where we are staying and the check whether it is a \"risk\" area. We are visiting in January and staying in Placencia for one week and Ambergris for the other. Placencia is a medium-risk area for Malaria so we are therefore taking tablets. It's not worth the risk. Tablets start a week before to check no side effects with the medication. If you are doing any trekking in Belize that takes you into jungle-type areas - you are advised to take Malaria. It doesn't really matter how much insect repellant, Skin So Soft you apply, there's always one that gets through it and that could be the one!\nHi there, \nI live in Canada and I'm going to Belize in march. I was in Venezuela in December\/January and I did not get a yellow fever shot prior to going. One of the requirements to get into belize is to have this shot if coming from a country where this is a risk. I'm not coming directly from this country and there will be 2 months and 1 week in between my trips but I just want to make sure I am not going to be denied entry into belize if I don't have the vaccinations. Does anybody know if this is necessary. I've been researching a lot and cannot find an answer. I don't want to get the vaccination if it is not necessary. Thank you\nAfter reading the WHO website and the CDC website, I think you'll be fine. It appears the incubation period for yellow fever is short, less than a week.\nHowever, I'd contact a travel clinic and ask them, just to be sure.\nI've traveled to Colombia, followed up a couple months later by a trip to Belize. I have been vaccinated against yellow fever, but, no one asked to see the certificate.\nBut, do contact your local travel clinic to make sure. They probably have better web sites than you or I can easily access.\n","234":"Note: this is an expanded\u00c2\u00a0version of an\u00c2\u00a0article by Jan Rasmusen previously\u00c2\u00a0published\u00c2\u00a0by DogsNaturallyMagazine.com\nAnimal Control sends a notice stating that your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rabies vaccination is due. Some of us will vaccinate readily. Because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legally mandated, it must be safe, right? Besides, what choice do we have?\nOthers of us panic, desperate to avoid the shot at any cost. We\u00c2\u00a0remember what happened the last time our dog had a rabies vaccination. We wonder, will our dog survive another?\u00c2\u00a0\nWorld-renowned pet vaccination scientist, Dr. Jean Dodds, wrote recently: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rabies vaccines are the most common group of biological products identified in adverse event reports received by the USDA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nAn adverse reaction to a rabies vaccine may exact a high price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health and your wallet. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you need to know to make vaccinating your dog safer:\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Learn to recognize adverse reactions. Short-term reactions include vomiting, facial swelling, fever, lethargy, circulatory shock, loss of consciousness and even death. (If your pet appears distressed, contact your vet immediately.) Reactions occurring days or months after vaccination can be difficult to recognize. They include:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Pica (eating inappropriate materials, including feces)\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Behavioral changes (aggression, separation anxiety, compulsive behaviors and more)\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you suspect a health or behavior problem may be connected to a vaccine, you may have to convince your vet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s common to hear \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the shot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a reaction like that is impossible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Even the drug\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturer (to whom you should immediately report the reaction \u00e2\u20ac\u201d giving them the\u00c2\u00a0brand and lot# \u00e2\u20ac\u201d may deny the connection. Insist on seeing the product\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s package insert,\u00c2\u00a0 viewable on-line or from your vet. Also know that long-term reactions aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually documented or even studied. Note: a vaccine reaction, especially one supported by your vet, may entitle you to compensation for medical expenses from the drug manufacturer.\n 2. Vaccinate healthy dogs only. Vaccinating an unhealthy animal can exacerbate illness and do irreparable harm. Also, immunity may not develop\u00c2\u00a0after vaccination because of the dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compromised immune system. This is especially dangerous as you may\u00c2\u00a0presume\u00c2\u00a0immunity that does not\u00c2\u00a0exist.\u00c2\u00a0Pets with autoimmune disease or cancer are obviously \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not healthy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but neither are pets suffering from stress from a move or surgery, a virus or infection, or allergies or skin problems or any other condition compromising health. (Never allow your pet to be vaccinated during surgery.)\n3. Ask for a rabies vaccination exemption.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0If your dog has documented health problems, ask your vet to apply for a rabies vaccination extension or exemption. Many localities permit them even if state law doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t specifically allow them. If your vet won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apply for an exemption, go elsewhere. You may want to contact a holistic vet who may better understand the dangers of vaccinating an unhealthy animal. If local law forbids exemptions, change the law. Numerous states are in the process of adding exemptions to their laws. Click this link to check your state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rabies law and pending exemptions.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n4.\u00c2\u00a0Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate against rabies within three weeks of other vaccinations or medication for parasites. Multiple vaccines given at once greatly\u00c2\u00a0increase the chance of reactions.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Multiple vaccines are especially risky for small dogs.\n5. Make sure your dog gets the correct vaccine. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re vaccinating a puppy, make sure your vet administers a one-year vaccine initially (as late as legally possible) and a three-year vaccine (or whatever is required in your area) thereafter. The one-year and three-year vaccines are virtually identical medically \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not under the law.\u00c2\u00a0 A one-year shot must be followed by re-vaccination a year later. Note: the one-year shot is not safer than the three-year\u00c2\u00a0(except that it may contain fewer adjuvants).\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n6. Vaccinate at the safest time. Vaccinate in the morning, early in the week, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave the area for at least an hour if possible. Watch for reactions for at least the next 48 hours. Reactions\u00c2\u00a0occurring when the closest vet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office is closed can prove disastrous, even fatal.\n7. Tell your vet you want a Thimerosol-free vaccine. Thimerosol (mercury) in vaccines has been linked to adverse reactions. Merial, for one, makes one- and three-year thimersol-free rabies vaccines: IMRAB\u00c2\u00ae 1 TF and IMRAB\u00c2\u00ae 3 TF. Make sure you see \u00e2\u20ac\u0153TF\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the label. (If your vet doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carry the vaccine, you may have to vet shop to find the vaccine you want.\u00c2\u00a0 You might also ask why the vet why he\/she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carry it.)\n8. Find a vet trained in homeopathy to vaccinate your dog.\u00c2\u00a0 Certain homeopathic remedies given before, during and after vaccinating\u00c2\u00a0can lessen the chance of ill effects from vaccination. Click the link to find vet referral lists.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n9. Report all vaccine reactions to your vet and make sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re recorded in your pet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s file. Have the vet sign relevant pages, get copies and put them in a safe place. (Vets lose records, retire and move away.) Also report the reaction to the drug\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturer. (You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need the vaccine lot number.) Vets are notoriously bad at reporting reactions, but exemptions to rabies vaccination\u00c2\u00a0and drug safety require documentation.\n10.

Fast forward to her 1 year shots, I was super nervous about giving them, but the vet would not work with me, or write me an exemption.  For the past 5 years, I switch vets every time they pressure me too hard to vaccinate my dog.  \nWell, I gave in last week and allowed her to get a rabies vaccine.  I warned of the terrible reactions she has had in the past, so they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pre-treated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd her.  While she didnt get the facial swelling, I did notice a lump about the size of an egg where the shot was given.  I called the vet and she told me to bring the dog back.  I did and the vet determined it was swelling (not fluid) heart rate and blood pressure was fine. \nNow it 5 days later and that lump is still there. Ive googled the hell out of it and I cannot find anything about lumps that appear immediately (or within an hour) and do not go away.  All I can find is information about lumps that appear a few days later, are hard, and the size of peas or marbles.  This one is much larger and soft and squishy.  \nCan you help me with some search words?  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m kind of freaking out.\nOh yeah, and I am moving to Arizona in 6 week for my job.  I will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153legal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the next 3 years, but what after that?  I am not vaccinating my dog ever again.  As far as I can tell, there are not medical exeptions in Arizona (not that I have been able to get any vet here in Ohio to do it for me), do I just have live outside the law?\n","235":"Immunization works by tricking the body into believing it is experiencing a full-scale invasion by an infectious agent so that the immune system can fortify its defenses. During vaccination, a harmless version of a germ is introduced to the body and the immune system responds by producing antibodies to attack the intruder. Thereafter, a memory of this \ufffdinvasion\ufffd remains so that the immune system can quickly recognize and neutralize disease-causing agents when they appear.\nThe Chinese performed a version of vaccination called variolation in the 16th century when they discovered they could prevent smallpox by exposing a healthy person to matter from the lesions of an infected person. In 1796, Edward Jenner, an English doctor, performed the first vaccination in Europe when he used a cowpox virus to vaccinate a young boy against the more deadly smallpox virus. (Dr. Jenner called this process vaccination after the Latin word for cow, vacca.)\nToday there are several types of vaccines. Some, such as the oral polio vaccine (OPV), are live, \ufffdattenuated\ufffd vaccines which means the virus has been weakened so that it stimulates antibody production, but does not cause the disease. Others such as the \ufffdwhole-cell\ufffd pertussis vaccine use an inactivated, or killed, virus that still triggers an immune response. Tetanus toxoid (TT), the vaccine that protects mothers and newborns from tetanus, is a detoxified version of the toxin (poison) that causes the disease. A fourth variety of vaccine, such as that for Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), uses only the components of the virus or bacteria that provoke an immune response.\nMothers can pass on immunity to their babies across the placenta during the final months of pregnancy. The amount of inherited immunity varies by disease and is an important factor in deciding when a child should be immunized. A mother's antibodies may protect a child from measles for 6 to 12 months. But, in the case of diseases such as pertussis, immunity may last only for a few weeks. Tetanus is one example where inherited immunity is critical and the mother must be immunized to offer protection to her newborn.\nFor many diseases, immunity is built up over several doses of vaccine. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the first polio vaccine be given at birth, along with the vaccine for childhood tuberculosis (BCG). In countries where transmission of hepatitis B from mother to child is common, these infants should be immunized against the disease at birth.\nThe remaining doses of polio vaccine and the combination diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus vaccine (DPT) should be given three times before the age of one: at six weeks, 10 weeks and 14 weeks. Due to inherited immunity, measles vaccines are typically given at nine months. Yellow fever is also given at this time for children in high-risk regions.\nThe more children in a community that are vaccinated, the less likely it is that any children, even those who have not been immunized, will get sick because there are fewer hosts for the infectious agents. This is referred to as \ufffdherd\ufffd immunity and it is particularly vital with extremely contagious diseases such as measles, where immunization of 90 to 95 per cent of\u00c2\u00a0infants is needed to protect a community from measles. However, this is not true for all diseases, such as tetanus, therefore an individual\ufffds vaccination status is important, not just group immunity.\nDigg, Del.icio.us, and Newsvine are web services enabling you to share stories on the Internet.\nThe blog this article feature enables you to generate a short summary of this article, ready to be pasted in a blog post.\nDigg and Newsvine are social news sites, where the top news stories are selected not by an editor but by its collective users.

Immunization is especially important for the hardest to reach families as it can also be a bridge to other life-saving care for mothers and children in isolated communities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as child nutritional screening, anti-malarial mosquito nets, vitamin A supplements and de-worming tablets. Immunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health investments we can make for future generations. \nVaccines are protecting more children than ever before. But, in 2015, nearly one in five infants - 19.4 million children - missed out on the basic vaccines they need to stay healthy. Low immunization levels compromise gains in all other areas of health for mothers and children. The poorest, most vulnerable children who need immunization the most continue to be the least likely to get it. \nAlmost one third of deaths among children under 5 are preventable by vaccine. UNICEF and its partners are working to change these numbers and ensure that all children are successfully protected with vaccines. But, if immunization is not prioritized, the most marginalized children will not get vaccines, which could mean the difference between life and death.\nRead up on progress and challenges in immunization coverage\u00c2\u00a0 - WUENIC 2015 (as of July 2016).\nWhat's happening for\u00c2\u00a0World Immunization Week 2016?\n","237":"Pediatric vaccine programs in the United States have been extremely successful against a range of contagious diseases, including measles, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, and poliomyelitis; fewer than 500 children die in the United States each year of vaccine-preventable diseases.\nHowever, healthy adults also require regular vaccines. As many as 50,000 to 70,000 adults die annually of pneumonia and influenza in the United States, which could be greatly reduced with vaccinations. Receiving appropriate immunizations plays a crucial role in protecting health throughout a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lifetime.\nThe following is a general discussion of vaccines currently recommended for healthy adults. Separate articles discuss vaccines for international travelers and children. (See \"Patient education: Vaccines for travel (The Basics)\" and \"Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines? (Beyond the Basics)\" and \"Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nThe immune system protects the body against illness and infection. When a person's immune system recognizes a foreign organism (bacterium, virus), it responds by creating proteins called antibodies. Antibodies fight the infection and help the person to recover.\nAntibodies also work to prevent a person from becoming ill in the future. The next time a person is exposed to the organism, the immune system recognizes it and rapidly produces the antibodies required to destroy the organism. This response protects the individual from developing the disease, ideally for life. For example, a person who had chickenpox as a child is unlikely to develop it again, even if he or she is in close contact with a person who is infected.\nVaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies. However, unlike bacteria and viruses, vaccines do not cause the person to become ill in order to develop these antibodies. There are two main types of immunizations: active and passive.\nActive vaccines \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Active vaccines use a weakened form of the harmful bacteria or virus or components of the bacteria or virus to stimulate the immune system. Some active vaccines are called live vaccines because they are made from a weakened form of the bacterium or virus.\nSome bacteria (eg, diphtheria, tetanus) cause illness because they produce a harmful substance in the body called toxins. Vaccines that help the immune system protect the body from toxins are called toxoids. Toxoids are made from weakened forms of the toxins of bacteria.\nPassive vaccines \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Passive vaccines provide temporary immunity with antibodies obtained from a large pool of donors; this preparation is known as immune serum globulin. Passive vaccines offer short-term protection to children or adults who have been exposed to a specific organism.\nVaccines protect children and adults \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Many people are concerned about the risks of vaccines. However, vaccines have a long record of being a safe and effective way of preventing disease. In most cases, the benefits of vaccinating are much greater than the potential risks. Diseases such as diphtheria and measles are uncommon in developed countries such as the United States. However, these illnesses are still common in developing countries.\nIt is easy for illness to spread to children or adults who are not vaccinated because immigrants and visitors can travel from affected areas. Vaccines help to reduce a child's, family's, and even an entire community's chances of becoming ill by decreasing the number of people who become sick and transmit the infection to other people. This process is sometimes referred to as \"herd immunity.\"\nAn example of a successful vaccine program is smallpox. Before a vaccine was available, smallpox killed millions of people every year. As a result of an intensive vaccination program, smallpox has been completely eliminated throughout the world.\nHow are vaccines given? \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Most immunizations are given to adults in the form of an injection into the upper arm. Some vaccines are also given in other ways, such as by mouth or as a nasal spray.\nMost vaccines are safe and cause few if any serious side effects. Very rarely, serious side effects do occur. People who are vaccinated and then develop symptoms that could be related to the vaccine should contact their healthcare provider. There is a national Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS, http:\/\/vaers.hhs.gov\/index, telephone number 1-800-822-7967), which can be consulted if necessary. Occasionally, recommendations for a vaccine are changed in response to this type of report.\nMild side effects \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0With many vaccines and toxoids, side effects can include:\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdA mild fever\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdA reddish, tender area at the site of injection\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdOccasionally, a \"serum sickness-like\" reaction that may be characterized by fever, skin rash, swollen lymph nodes, joint pain, and\/or other symptoms\nSevere side effects \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Severe side effects of vaccines are rare but may include a severe neurologic reaction (eg, seizures) or severe allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis). Allergic reactions usually occur within minutes to hours of receiving the vaccine. If this occurs in the healthcare provider's office, emergency care can be given immediately. If a severe reaction occurs later, the person or a family member should call emergency medical services, available in most areas of the United States by calling 911.\nReasons to avoid vaccination \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0A particular vaccine may not be recommended for people with a serious allergic reaction to the following:\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdEggs or egg protein, since some vaccines are prepared with embryonic chicken eggs or cultures (eg, influenza vaccine, yellow fever vaccine). A mild allergy to eggs does not mean that the vaccine should be avoided. There is a type of influenza vaccine (recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine) that is safe for people with a serious allergic reaction to eggs because the vaccine is not prepared using eggs.\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdThe antibiotic medications neomycin or streptomycin (some vaccines contains trace amounts of neomycin)\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdGelatin\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdA specific vaccine\nIn addition, live virus vaccines, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the varicella vaccine are generally not recommended for the following groups:\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdThose with a weakened immune system, since there is an increased risk of infection as a result of the vaccination\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdPatients who have recently received a blood transfusion or immune serum globulin, which can delay the normal response to active vaccination. In this case, the vaccination should be delayed for one month.\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdWomen who are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant within the next 28 days, due to the potential risk of the vaccine to the developing fetus\nIn some cases, there is an alternative vaccine that is not live that can be used. For example, the injectable form of the influenza vaccine is not live and is recommended for those who cannot receive live vaccines, such as pregnant women and those with a weakened immune system.\nConditions that do not affect vaccination \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0The following conditions do not require that a person delay or avoid vaccination:\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdCurrent or recent mild illness, with or without low grade fever\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdCurrent or recent antibiotic therapy\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdPrevious mild to moderate tenderness, redness, or swelling at the site of injection or fever less than 104.9\u00c2\u00baF (40.5\u00c2\u00baC) after any previous vaccination\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdA personal history of allergies, except those listed above\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdA family history of adverse reactions to vaccines\nChildhood vaccinations \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Ideally, children should begin receiving vaccinations at birth. This allows the child to be protected from common childhood illnesses as well as illnesses that can develop during adulthood. Many diseases prevented by vaccines are more serious in young children.\nIn addition, most infants visit a healthcare provider frequently during the first year, which improves the chances of completing most vaccines that require multiple doses. In most states, some vaccines are required before the child can attend school; these requirements vary from one state to another.\nThe recommended vaccine schedules for children and adolescents in the United States are available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website (figure 1A-B).\nAdult vaccines \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0In the United States, immunizations are recommended for healthy adults based upon policies developed by expert groups (figure 2). Additional information concerning vaccines can be obtained from the CDC Hotline (at 1-800-232-2522) or downloaded from the CDC website.\nRecommendations also apply to people with an increased risk of developing certain infections (and\/or transmitting them to at-risk individuals), including the following:\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdResidents of long-term care facilities (including nursing homes), young adults residing in college dormitories, household members living with at-risk individuals, or inmates of correctional facilities\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdHealthcare or public safety workers, laboratory staff, daycare center workers, and food handlers\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdTravelers to particular countries (see \"Patient education: Vaccines for travel (The Basics)\")\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdMen who have sex with men, people with multiple sex partners, and those who use injectable street drugs\nPneumococcal \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be fatal, especially in older adults, individuals with underlying medical conditions, and those with a weakened immune system. Pneumonia is usually caused by bacteria; the most common is Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus. Pneumococcal pneumonia can develop as a complication of a respiratory tract viral infection such as influenza. (See \"Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nThe pneumococcal vaccines protect against many of the types of pneumococci. More detailed information about the pneumococcal vaccines is available separately. (See \"Patient education: Pneumonia prevention in adults (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nInfluenza \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Commonly known as flu, influenza is a highly contagious viral infection that occurs in outbreaks worldwide, usually in the winter season in the United States and other nontropical regions. Serious complications can develop in people with influenza, including bacterial pneumonia. (See \"Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nA vaccine to prevent influenza is recommended for nearly all adults. These vaccines are discussed separately. (See \"Patient education: Influenza prevention (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nTetanus, diphtheria, pertussis \n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdTetanus is a wound infection caused by a bacterial toxin. The bacterium resides in soil and the intestinal tracts of certain mammals and enters the body through a wound; it then multiplies and produces toxins that act on nerves controlling muscle activity.\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdDiphtheria is a sudden illness caused by a bacterium that is usually transmitted via droplets coughed or sneezed into the air. The bacteria typically multiply in the throat and may release a toxin into the bloodstream, which can lead to damage of the brain and heart.\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdPertussis, or whooping cough, is an upper respiratory illness caused by a bacterium called Bordetella pertussis. The bacterium is spread easily and can cause serious illness, especially in infants and people with a weakened immune system.\nTetanus and diphtheria are rare in the United States because most infants are given a series of five vaccinations, starting at two months of age. Some people have an increased risk of developing tetanus or diphtheria, including people who were not vaccinated during childhood, older adults (due to a decline in protection from the vaccine over time), people who live in rural areas, injection drug users, and immigrants. (See \"Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nPertussis has become increasingly common in adults, despite the fact that most people were immunized during childhood. This is due to fading immunity to pertussis over time.\nA tetanus-diphtheria (Td) booster vaccine is recommended for all adults every 10 years for life. Adults under age 65 who have not had the combined tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine (Tdap) should get one dose of Tdap instead of their next regular tetanus booster (Td), followed by the Td booster every 10 years. Adults aged 65 years or older who are healthcare workers or who have close contact with infants under one year of age (eg, grandparents, childcare providers) should get a single dose of Tdap as soon as they can, regardless of how long ago they had a tetanus booster. Adults over age 65 who do not have close contact with infants can also receive a single dose of Tdap. If the booster dose is overdue and there is concern that the person was exposed to tetanus, tetanus immune globulin is given along with the Td or Tdap. The immune globulin provides temporary protection from the toxin. A series of three tetanus-diphtheria vaccines, one of which includes acellular pertussis (Tdap), is recommended for adults who did not receive any of the childhood diphtheria-tetanus vaccines. (See 'Passive vaccines' above.)\nMeasles-mumps-rubella (MMR) \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Measles, mumps, and rubella are transmitted by infected patients who release airborne droplets while coughing or sneezing.\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdMeasles is a highly contagious viral illness of the respiratory tract that primarily affects children; it causes a distinctive rash, fever, and cough and may result in complications, including infection of the middle ear and lungs.\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdMumps, an acute, usually mild viral infection of childhood, is primarily characterized by painful swelling of the salivary glands; however, complications may sometimes result, including inflammation of the protective membranes of the brain (meningitis) and, in males affected after puberty, swelling and tenderness of one or both testes (orchitis).\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdRubella, also known as German measles, is typically a mild viral infection characterized by fever, swelling of the lymph nodes, and rash; however, it can cause severe birth defects (congenital rubella syndrome) if the mother is affected during early pregnancy.\nThe incidence of these diseases fell dramatically in the United States since the live virus vaccine was developed. Despite the rarity of the diseases in the United States, continued protection of children as well as adults is recommended for a number of reasons:\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdCases of measles brought from other countries have the potential to be a major source of future exposure unless the population remains immune. An unusually high number of imported cases of measles occurred in the first five months of 2011 and resulted in nine outbreaks of secondary cases that occurred in the United States.\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdAdults with measles have an increased risk of death. Measles during pregnancy can cause early labor and miscarriage.\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdThe most serious complications of mumps occur more frequently in adults than children, including orchitis (leading to sterility in men), neurologic complications, and risk of fetal death if the infection is acquired in early pregnancy.\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdVaccination can help to eliminate the most important consequences of rubella, including miscarriage, fetal death, and congenital rubella syndrome.\nA series of MMR vaccines is given to most infants and children in the United States. People who were born before 1957 in the United States are usually considered to be immune to measles and mumps. If you are not sure that you had measles, mumps and rubella or whether you were vaccinated against these diseases, a blood test can verify immunity. If you are not immune to measles or mumps or rubella (ie, to one or more of the three diseases), the MMR vaccine is recommended. Healthcare workers born before 1957 whose blood test does not show measles or mumps immunity or who do not have laboratory confirmation of having had disease, vaccination with two doses of MMR should be considered. During outbreaks of measles or mumps, such individuals should receive two doses of MMR.\nThere are no adverse consequences of receiving MMR if you are already immune to one or more of the three diseases. High-risk groups include women who could become pregnant, college students, healthcare workers, and international travelers. If you are in one of these high-risk groups and are not immune to measles, mumps, or rubella, you should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine. If you are not in one of these high-risk groups and are not immune to measles, mumps, or rubella, you should receive one dose of MMR. However, MMR should not be administered to pregnant women or women considering pregnancy in the next 28 days.\nVaricella (chickenpox) \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Chickenpox is a highly contagious viral illness caused by infection with the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The disease causes fever, sore throat, and a distinctive, itchy, blistering rash that later forms scabs. The virus is transmitted by airborne droplets or direct contact with the skin rash. Chickenpox is discussed in detail separately. (See \"Patient education: Chickenpox prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nTwo doses of varicella vaccine are needed, with the second dose administered four to eight weeks after the first. Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant within the next month and those with a history of anaphylactic reactions to neomycin or gelatin should not receive the varicella vaccine.\nHerpes zoster (shingles) \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Herpes zoster is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After an episode of chickenpox, the virus lingers in cells of the nervous system, where it can reside quietly for decades. Herpes zoster can occur in individuals of all ages, but it is uncommon in children, adolescents, and young adults. It is much more common in adults aged 50 years and older and in those whose immune system has been weakened. (See \"Patient education: Shingles (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nA vaccine to prevent herpes zoster infection is available in the United States, Europe, and Australia. In studies of patients who received the vaccine, the incidence of herpes zoster infection was reduced by 50 percent; in those patients who did develop herpes zoster, the severity and duration of infection was modestly reduced, and the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (a painful complication of herpes zoster) was reduced by greater than 60 percent.\nThe vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older. It should not be used by people with a weakened immune system, pregnant women, or those with a history of a severe allergic reaction to gelatin or neomycin.\nHepatitis B \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) is caused by infection with certain viruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV). Although the infection often resolves or is asymptomatic (does not cause symptoms), HBV can result in chronic infection that can lead to progressive liver scarring (cirrhosis) or liver cancer. HBV is transmitted by contact with an infected individual's body fluids, such as during unprotected sexual intercourse, the sharing of contaminated needles during injection drug use, or contact with contaminated blood or blood products. HBV can also be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her baby. (See \"Patient education: Hepatitis B (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nMore than 100,000 people, mostly adults, are infected with HBV each year in the United States. Although the overall lifetime risk of acquiring HBV is only about 5 percent for the average person, the risk increases to almost 100 percent in the highest risk groups.\nA vaccine is available that protects against HBV. HBV vaccination is now recommended for all children in early childhood or as a \"catch-up\" immunization during early adolescence. In addition, any adult who is at risk for HBV infection should receive the HBV vaccine. The vaccine is given in three doses, with the second and third doses given one month and six months after the first dose.\nAdults who should receive the HBV vaccine include:\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdHealthcare and public safety workers\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdPersonnel in institutions caring for the developmentally disabled and employees and inmates of correctional facilities\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdHousehold contacts and sex partners of people with chronic HBV\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdIndividuals with multiple sex partners, people with sexually transmitted diseases, and men who have sex with men\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdPeople who inject street drugs\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdPeople who require blood clotting factors or kidney dialysis\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdPeople from countries where HBV is consistently present (endemic) and certain international travelers (see \"Patient education: Vaccines for travel (The Basics)\")\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdPeople with diabetes who are between ages 19 and 59\nPeople with anaphylactic reactions to yeast should not receive HBV vaccine.\nHepatitis A \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Hepatitis due to infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV) is one of the most common viral infections in children and adolescents in the United States. HAV infection often causes few or no symptoms in children. By contrast, infection in adults can vary in severity from a mild flu-like illness to rapidly progressive, severe hepatitis. Vaccinating children can help to protect adult caregivers from a potentially serious illness. (See \"Patient education: Hepatitis A (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nHAV is found in the stool of infected individuals. A person can become infected with HAV by consuming contaminated food or water or by touching the mouth, nose, or eyes after touching a contaminated surface (eg, in the bathroom or during a diaper change). Washing the hands can help to prevent infection.\nVaccines are available to prevent infection with HAV. Both are equally effective in preventing infection.\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdVAQTA is given in two doses, with the second dose given 6 to 18 months after the first dose. This vaccine was temporarily recalled in the fall of 2001 because some prefilled syringes did not contain the proper amount of antigen to produce a reliable amount of antibody; this problem was subsequently corrected. People who were previously vaccinated against hepatitis A should contact their healthcare provider to determine which vaccine was given and if revaccination is needed.\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdHAVRIX is given in two doses, with the second dose given 6 to 12 months after the first.\nThe HepA vaccine is recommended for susceptible at risk adults, including:\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdTravelers to countries where HAV is common\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdInjection and non-injection illegal drug users\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdMen who have sex with men\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdPeople with chronic liver disease\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdAdults with blood clotting factor disorders\n\u00e2\u2014\ufffdAdults who are at risk for infection at work, including daycare center staff, personnel in healthcare facilities (eg, nursing homes), and food handlers\nWomen who are pregnant should discuss the risks and benefits of the HepA vaccine with their obstetrical healthcare provider.\nMeningococcal \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0 Neisseria meningitidis is a bacterium that causes serious illnesses, including bacterial meningitis. The bacteria lives on surfaces of the nose and pharynx (wind pipe) and is transmitted from person to person by direct contact with respiratory secretions. Although meningococcal disease is easily treated in most people, 10 to 14 percent of people die from the infection.\nMeningococcal vaccines are available to prevent infection. Expert groups recommend a meningococcal vaccine for all adolescents, college freshmen living in dormitories, military recruits, travelers going to areas where meningococcal disease frequently occurs, microbiologists who are exposed to Neisseria meningitidis, people who have had their spleen removed or whose spleen does not work properly, and people with terminal complement deficiency. Meningococcal vaccines can be used in adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes more than 99 percent of cases of cervical cancer and genital warts. Persistent infection with certain types of HPV can lead to cancer of the cervix, anus, vagina, vulva, penis, mouth, or sinuses.\nTwo vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix) are available for females to help prevent infection with certain types of HPV. An article about the HPV vaccine is available separately.

After a few days, a rash develops and spreads all over the body. People who recover from measles are immune for the rest of their lives, though unlike the flu, there is no specific antiviral treatment for the illness. Care instead is supportive, and includes a focus on hydration and nutrition. Antibiotics can be prescribed in cases where pneumonia or an ear or eye infection develops.\nThe virus' qualities make it easy to spread in an environment like Disneyland, which during the winter holidays can reach 70,000 visitors a day. Not only is measles highly contagious \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spreading through both direct contact and through the air by coughing and sneezing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it also remains in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. If one person has it, 90 percent of the people close to that person who have not been vaccinated may also become infected, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nTwo doses of a vaccine are 99 percent effective in preventing infection. According to the CDC, children should get a first vaccine around 12 months and then receive a booster by the age of 6, or before kindergarten. Teens and adults also can get the vaccine if they haven't before \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and can discover immunity through a simple blood test. \nThe majority of the unvaccinated for whom the state public health agency had detailed information were not vaccinated primarily to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal beliefs,\" Dr. Gil Chavez, state epidemiologist and deputy director at the Center for Infectious Diseases for the California Department of Public Health, said in an email. She also noted that some were infants younger than 12 months of age who were too young to be vaccinated. \nAccording to an article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, people who were not in the targeted age group went unvaccinated, leaving a gap of people in older age groups who were not protected. \"The major problem with measles in highly vaccinated populations occurred among middle school, junior high school, senior high school, and college students,\" the article read. \"The quickest way to eliminate that problem would be a mass revaccination campaign of all such students. This was considered too expensive and logistically difficult to carry out.\" \n Previous reports, however, give some clues about vaccination disparities. Many infections during the 1989 to 1991 outbreak were centered in areas where vaccinations levels were low. In fact, the CDC reported: \"Surveys in areas experiencing outbreaks among preschool-aged children indicated that as few as 50 percent of children had been vaccinated against measles by their second birthday, and that black and Hispanic children were less likely to be age-appropriately vaccinated than were white children.\" \nSome parents also may be delaying vaccinations rather than refusing them outright. \"By and large the vast majority of children are immunized, but not all children are immunized, and not all children are immunized in a timely fashion,\" says Edwards, who is on the committee for infectious disease for the American Academy of Pediatrics. Some parents may opt not to get a series of vaccines all at once, she points out, but that delays the administration of the vaccine. \n","239":"The MMR vaccine was first alleged to be a cause of autism in 1998, when Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a British researcher, published a study in The Lancet claiming that the 12 children with neurodevelopmental delays (eight of whom had autism) he examined had the measles virus in their guts. Serious ethical problems such as financial ties to trial lawyers and a skewed sample group brought the validity of the study into question. Subsequent studies have failed to replicate Dr. Wakefield's results and he is currently facing professional misconduct charges as a result of this study in front of the United Kingdom's General Medical Council.\nTen of the 13 original authors have since retracted their names from the paper, and The Lancet has discredited its findings, yet the controversy has continued despite the lack of science connecting the MMR vaccine to autism.\nBelow are links to the studies disproving the hypothesis that MMR vaccines cause autism.\nSafety of Vaccines Used for routine Immunization of US Children: A Systematic Review. \n Pediatrics, Maglione et al.

Many doctors who consider themselves \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pro-vaccine,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual.\nMany doctors recommend a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delayed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule.

Well... mysterious to conventional doctors and media that is. Vaccinated for flu, gets sick (with type A and B flu, both of which are in the toxic vaccine), is given ibuprofen (a usual prelude to these types of deaths-- as in shoot the attack dog), then given 'IV' in hospital (yes antibiotics would be there, which are pro-viral folks in case you don't know). Then she dies.\n All totally avoidable; flu shots don't work, well established in conventional medical literature, ibuprofen paralyzes the immune system and stops the life saving fever, and then going to the hospital that only knows its antibiotics and IV and nothing about sodium ascorbate.\n As Dr Fred Klenner said \"Some physicians would stand by and see their patient die rather than use ascorbic acid because in their finite minds it exists only as a vitamin.\" Here is proof that his words are so true.\" Read full story\nOur daughter, Roz, was born a happy, healthy little girl on June 17, 2010. She developed just like all children her age and hit her milestones on or before the target age. My husband and I decided to do vaccines one at a time on a delayed schedule after our first family doctor gave her Pediarix (6 in 1) vaccine. At the age of one, we began with her DTaP vaccinations and spread them out over a period of time. At her two-year checkup, we decided to begin MMR vaccinations.\nOn June 12, 2012, Roz was given the MMR vaccine. She had the normal fussy period, as she did with the DTaP, but after a week, she began to seem a little off, not as responsive, and she continued to be fussy. She began to run a low-grade fever on June 27. On June 28, my husband noticed she wasn't moving and was in a staring state, unresponsive. We immediately rushed her to the ER. After 30 minutes, the doctor confirmed she was having a seizure and had a fever of 101.1. They ran a series of tests and found nothing in the ways of infection, virus or bacteria. The doctors told us that she had had a febrile seizure. They told us not to worry because febrile seizures are common in children. Read story\nGianna Wehrkamp, 2 (above), was vaccinated for flu, got the flu, and was given Tamiflu, and died within 24 hours. This is a disturbing, but growing trend.\n When children vaccinated for the flu or other disease then get the disease, they are often administered another pharmaceutical product such as Tamiflu, Tylenol, Ibuprofen or Vancomycin. When they die shortly after administration of those drugs, the deaths are always attributed to the flu, never the drug interactions. And the death is used to create more fear of the disease and calls for more vaccinations.\n When doctors say they have seen first hand \"horrible deaths from vaccine preventable diseases\" the truth is that they have seen children die from medical interventions by doctors. But doctors almost never admit that the medical interventions they administered were the cause of a child's death. So, in addition to the willfull blindness to the damage they are causing, doctors use those child deaths to scare parents into authorizing more vaccines.\n Kiera Driscoll, 5 (below), was vaccinated for infuenza A, and then came down with influenza A. She was given steroids and died that same day. Her death was blamed on flu. These are just two of many such \"flu\" deaths that have been reported across the country in vaccinated children.\nAn anonymous UK nurse has reported that a large number of perfectly normal, healthy girls have been admitted into psychiatric wards, strapped down, drugged, after a recent HPV vaccination. It's due to an autoimmune condition triggered by the vaccine which attacks the brain, but doctors initially assume they are mentally ill, and possibly a threat to themselves or others. The condition is called anti-NMDA receptor autoimmune encephalitis or \"AE\" for short, and has also been reported after TDaP vaccination. \"Brain on Fire\" is how many girls describe the pain. Thanks to one exceptional doctor, author Suzanne Cahalan was able to survive the nightmare and write about it. The official position that \"AE\" is \"rare\" is countered by the UK report and that there is already an organization, The AE Alliance, to support families affected by this \"disease.\"  See this parental account of a daughter's AE after Cervarix vaccination. \nClick above for Neil's books!\nRecently published article: Combining Childhood Vaccines at One Visit Is Not Safe by Neil Z.

In the Parents Speak Out section of this site, there are dozens of such accounts as well as links to a dozen more websites which in all, contain thousands of reports; all in great detail. Some doctors say \"coincidence,\" but after hearing a number of these first-hand accounts, you'll quickly see that the deaths following vaccination are not \"coincidence\" and to suggest so is an insult to one's intelligence. \n This website features doctors from a variety of specialties who are speaking publicly about the damage being done to babies, infants, children and adults. Video is the preferred media so you can hear it directly from the doctors, in their own words. There are also resources such as how to find a doctor in your area who will respect your decision regarding vaccines and, if necessary, sign your child's exemption form for school or daycare. \nYour pediatrician will not warn you of the true risks of vaccination because they don't want to scare you away from vaccinating, and regular office visits for that purpose. They may actually believe that the \"greater good\" is being served, even if your child is one of the many who are sacrificed under that misguided rationalization. But, as you listen to each doctor here, you'll get a few more pieces to the puzzle, and gradually, the big picture will emerge. Based on that realiztion, you will have the information you need to make a decision on whether to vaccinate, or to join the growing number of no-longer-vaccinating families who are reporting stunning good health in their unvaccinated children, in comparison to their vaccinated siblings. \t\n \tThe 24 videos on this page serve as an introduction to key issues parents must be aware of before consenting to vaccination. Just as compelling are the first-hand accounts of parents who describe in great detail exactly what happened to their children following vaccination. Only a tiny percentage of these adverse reactions are reported as a vaccine-injury and that under-reporting leads doctors to say it's \"rare,\" even though they may see it in their own practice several times a week. This turning-a-blind-eye on the part of doctors is encouraged by hospital administrators so that financial incentives for high vaccination rates will continue to flow. See this shocking report on How Much Money Pediatricians Really Make From Vaccinating. \"Whenever I meet a pediatrician I ask them a simple question: what percentage of your revenue come from vaccine administration? The number always astounds me. The answers I get are that anywhere from 60-80% of their revenue comes from giving vaccines. Imagine that.\" - J.B. Handley, Generation Rescue \nStudies are designed by vaccine makers to produce results favorable to their business. They do this using \"scientific\" sleight-of-hand, such as manipulating statistics. Doctors then use those statistics to trick parents into doubting what they see with their own eyes; their child's health declining \"coincidently\" with each vaccination. \n\"Parents cannot get real vaccine information through mainstream media.\" \"The flu shot recommended for pregnant women contains a spermacide known to cause spontaneous abortion and birth defects.\" \"My mother died from an autoimmune disease as a result of a flu shot.\" \"Do not get vaccinated. Zero. Zip. Nada. Nothing.\" - Dr Len Horowitz \n\"Children younger than 14 are three times more likely to die or suffer adverse reactions after receiving hepatitis B vaccines than to catch the disease.\" Source: Association of American Physicians and Surgeons press release written in 1999, when there had been 48 deaths from hepatitis B vaccine reported to VAERS.  \n As of January 15, 2015 there have been 1,053 deaths from Hep B vaccine reported to VAERS. What's changed? Legislators and pharmaceutical cronies are trying to make this vaccine even more compulsory by pushing bills to take away exemptions. Money is the motive and our children are the casualties.  \n In China, after 17 babies died following Hep B vaccination, the government ordered 3 vaccine manufacturers to stop production until they come up to 2013 safety standards. Notwithstanding, government investigators ruled that the deaths were not linked to the vaccines. Source \n\"I've had many parents tell me that their child has been harmed by the MMR.\" - Dr Jay Gordon, MD \n Don't Fear the Measle! The last fatal case of measles in the United States was in 2003. However, CDC tries to scare us by reporting worldwide death figures that include populations which are malnourished and live in unsanitary conditions, and news reporters then refer to measles as \"deadly.\" We should be more concerned about the not rare serious vaccine side-effects listed on the MMR Package Insert such as type-1 diabetes, thrombocytopenia, deafness, blindness, and death. The VAERS database indicates that between 2000-2014 there were 140 deaths reported from the MMR vaccine. Evidence shows that Recent Measles Cases are Due to Vaccine Failure, not failure to vaccinate. Dr Sandy Reider, MD explains: There is NO Measles Crisis. \n Since \"wild\" measles was gone by 2000, recent cases of measles are most likely \"atypical measles\" which is caused by the vaccine and is more severe than \"wild\" cases. NIH has known since 1995 that children recently vaccinated with the MMR vaccine become contagious for the measles. This is because the measles virus they have been injected with is detectible in their urine and saliva for up to 6 weeks. Just think of how many recently vaccinated children are at Disneyland or in your child's classroom. Those are the primary vectors of the outbreak.   See also: Measles Inclusion Body Encephalitis Caused By Vaccine-Strain Measles Virus \n A 2014 Council on Foreign Relations report revealed that the most highly vaccinated populations are also those with the greatest number of outbreaks for those same infectious diseases. This was especially the case for measles, mumps, rubella, polio and pertussis, with the U.S., Canada and rest of the Western world leading the list. The Office of Medical and Scientific Justice, which analyzed the report, concluded that the Council's report clearly suggests the theory of \"herd immunity\" is failing or was flawed to begin with. Given the repeated incidents of infectious outbreaks in populations with 94% or more vaccine compliance, and the emergence of new viral strains, the theory of vaccine-induced herd immunity should be abandoned. The Office offers several possibilities to explain the report: 1) vaccines are increasingly becoming ineffective and causing \"immune dysfunction,\" and 2) \"vaccine antigen responses\" may be reprogramming viruses while weakening the immune system in the most vaccinated individuals. More... \nHistory tells us that measles is a disease of undernourishment, particularly deficiencies in vitamin A. When scientists isolated these nutrients in the early 1900s, and people became more aware of the effect of nutrition on infectious disease, measles death rates dropped significantly, down more than 98% in the US by the time the measles vaccine was licensed in 1963. Source: Why I'm Not Afraid of Measles by Jennifer Schmid, MSN, RN, CNL \nWatch for these adverse events after vaccination: difficulty swallowing, constipation, diarrhea, asthma, eczema, ear infections, inconsolable high-pitched cry from brain inflammation, nose bleeds (ITP), narcolespy, seizures, convulsions, autism, polio-like symptoms, MS, meningitis, myocarditis, vasculitis, stroke, sudden unexplained death. The claim that such vaccination sequalae are rare is just one of the many lies that doctors are trained to tell. Another lie is that vaccines contribute to \"herd immunity.\" The truth is, vaccines do not work but do spread disease. Lie #3: \"The science is settled and vaccines are safe.\" The doctors featured on this site reveal the truth so parents can make an informed choice. See also: The Science is Not Settled by Sandy Reider, MD \nWhen Heather Robinson of Homewood, Illinois took her 15-month-old daughter for an MMR shot, the girl broke out in a rash that covered every inch of her body, even the inside of her ears. \"I was totally freaking out,\" she said. \"I thought it was measles.\" It turned out to be a reaction to the shot. For more on vaccine-induced disease, see the these  articles and studies. \n\"There has never been a single vaccine in this country that has ever been submitted to a controlled scientific study. They never took a group of 100 people who were candidates for a vaccine, gave 50 of them a vaccine and left the other 50 alone, and measured the outcome. And since that has never been done, that means if you want to be kind, you will call vaccines an unproven remedy. If you want to be accurate, you'll call the people who give vaccines quacks.\" - Dr Robert S. Mendelsohn, MD \n If you believe that vaccines work, then you must ask, \"Does it make sense to suppress the mild, temporary symptoms of measles or mumps, but greatly increase the chances of my child getting diabetes, autism, epilepsy and\/or leukemia?\" If vaccines \"work,\" that is the tradeoff you are making. But it is a lose-lose, because you are risking the serious side-effects, plus depriving the child of a vital developmental process. Children benefit from experiencing the normal childhood diseases. It's how the immune system matures and becomes stonger. Allowing a child to get chicken pox when young will confer lifetime immunity and prevent shingles later in life; a more serious condition. Additionally, children who experience chicken pox or influenza have a significantly reduced incidence of brain cancer later in life. A reduced cancer rate (ovarian, skin, brain) has also been found in adults who have experienced measles, mumps and rubella early in life. Lastly, vaccinating girls prevents them, in the future, from passing on natural immunity to their children via breast milk. \n Vaccines do not \"help\" the immune system; they suppress it! They suppress the body's ability to mount a proper defense, make the person an asymptomatic carrier, and due to the immuno-suppressive action, leave the person succeptible to even more serious, chronic diseases. Would you turn off your home fire alarm and think that your house is protected from fire because the alarm is turned off? Much of what is called \"disease\" is actually the body's courageous attempt to eliminate toxins in order to achieve greater health. Hindering that process in any way is harmful and sets up the person for real health problems in the future.\n\"The 2015 CDC Childhood Vaccination Schedule includes 54 vaccines by age 6 years. If mothers get the flu shot and TDaP in pregnancy, that's 58 vaccines. When you take your infant to his or her \"well baby check-up\" at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12-15 months, your infant will receive 8-10 vaccinations each time. Infants vaccinated according to \"the schedule\" can receive 13 vaccines all at once at six-months. This is a complex medical procedure which has never been tested for either safety or efficacy. Never tested. Not once. There are ZERO studies of the [synergistic toxicity of the concurrent shots in the] childhood vaccine schedule as it is administered.\n \"Those vaccines not only contain viral and bacterial antigens, they also contain aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde, polysorbate 80, detergent, MSG, antibiotics, food proteins including milk, eggs, and yeast, DNA from cows, dogs, chickens, rabbits, mice, and insects, and DNA from aborted human fetuses. The combined effect of injecting all of these substances at once has not been studied. It's all one great big experiment. This is the study and your child is the subject.\" - Marcella Piper-Terry, MS \n Can measles be good for you? Can getting measles protect against cancer? Can getting the MMR vaccine be associated with increased childhood cancers? According to the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, \"The types of cancers that develop in children are different from those that develop in adults. Lifestyle or environmental risk factors don\u00c3\u201a\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play a role. Instead, it\u00c3\u201a\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually the result of DNA changes in cells that take place very early in life.\" What can cause DNA changes in cells very early in life? Vaccines containing recombinant DNA from aborted fetal cell lines. Are we trading mild, childhood infections for serious, chronic illness and cancers? Prior to the advent of the mass vaccination of children, childhood cancers were rare. Now? See Measles is Good For You? \nAre you willing to risk the life of your child on the assumption that vaccine makers would not lie about the safety of their products? Well, they are lying.   Studies cited for safety and efficacy have been faked using all manner of scientific fraud. Dr Gary Null spent well over seven years extensively analyzing the studies and was shocked at the amount of fraud that he found. The FDA does not do independant testing for safety or efficacy; they simply accept the manufacturer's word that they are safe, along with a hefty processing fee. Studies that show serious adverse effects are simply buried in favor of faked studies claiming safety and efficacy. As a result, doctors are being misled about the safety of the drugs and vaccines they advocate. Your child is irreplaceable, and vaccine-injury often irreversible, so please listen to these and the many other doctors who have no financial interest in vaccines, have done their own research, and are speaking out so parents can be fully informed.\nIf you are about to give birth, please absorb as much of this material as possible in order to be in a position to make an educated decision (and write it into your birth plan) prior to your delivery date.\nIf your infant is due for a \"well-baby\" visit, please study this information in depth prior to that date. Postpone your appointment if necessary to gain sufficient time to study this information including vaccine ingredients. According to Dr Mendelsohn, well baby visits are  merely vaccine-pushing sessions which do not benefit the child.\nIf you have a child in school or daycare, learn which vaccine exemptions are available in your state and how to claim them.\nIf you have a pre-teen or teenaged girl, learn about the deaths and disability following the HPV vaccine which is being pushed on that age group. Not to mention the life long sterility due to \"premature ovarian failure.\"\nIf your child has been diagnosed with autism or has exhibited behavioral or gastrointestinal distress following vaccination, see how parents have recovered their child by following a safe, drug-free bio-medical protocol.\nIf you have an elderly loved-one in a nursing home where flu shots are routinely administered, you must learn about the death and disability following flu vaccination, which by the way, has zero efficacy in the elderly, and in many cases,  still contains mercury!\nIf you already know about the horrors of vaccination and you are looking for support from other non-vaccinating parents, there are numerous Facebook groups listed that will welcome and assist you with questions. In addition, there are lists to help you find a doctor in your area who will respect your decision about vaccination and, if necessary, sign your child's exemption form for school or daycare.\nIf you are a doctor who disregards parental reports as merely \"anecdotal\", then the sheer number of serious adverse events being reported --within hours or days following vaccination-- should make you reconsider that perhaps it is the published literature that is factually incorrect, and that it is that parents who are correct in their conviction that the vaccines are causal. Doctors rely primarily on studies but, vaccine makers manipulate studies to hide vaccine-injury. See Fraud in Vaccine Safety Studies. And this article on how vaccine makers hide vaccine ingredients, even from doctors: Doctors are Puppets for Vaccine Manufacturers. See also the Newsweek article: Bad Medicine: Big Pharma Plays Hide-the-Ball With Data and many more articles on fraud in the peer-review system. And finally, Doctors & Nurses: You Are The Vaccine Fraud Tipping Point. \nWhen doctors say an adverse event following vaccination is merely \"coincidental,\" think of what they are saying. They are saying that your child would have become autistic anyway (or died suddenly for no apparent reason) and it's just coincidence that it happened after the vaccines. That theory is easily disproven by the fact that with extremely rare exception, UNvaccinated children are NOT dying from SIDS nor becoming autistic. \n Doctors assume that there is a \"background rate\" of autism and SIDS in the population that is consistent with the rate we are seeing. The trouble with that notion is that the so-called \"background rate\" is in a population that is mostly vaccinated. So, the real question is, \"what is the background rate of autism and SIDS in the UNvaccinated?\" That rate is near zero. Doctors posit that such real-life evidence of harm can be ignored because it's \"anectodal\" and they have \"studies\" that fail to prove harm. But failing to  prove harm is NOT proof of no harm. And studies can and have been manipulated to say whatever the sponsoring entities desire. Hundreds of valid studies exist which DO show vaccine harm, but they are strangely ignored and not widely publicized. \n Make no mistake... nearly all studies are conducted by the vaccine makers, and they do NOT make the study raw data public. They only publish their \"conclusions.\" The FDA then accepts those conclusions and grants approval based on that, without even reviewing the raw data to verify that the conclusion matches the data! There have been cases where the raw data has been obtained from whistleblowers, and that data shows serious adverse events which were not reported in the published conclusion. So doctors who base their vaccine views on \"studies,\" are unknowingly putting their patients at risk. The FDA does NOT do indepentant testing for vaccine safety and efficacy! Note: A proposed new law would require all clinical trial study data to be publicized. \n Also, note that many vaccine package inserts carry the disclaimer that \"This vaccine was not tested for impairment of fertility, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity.\" Have you ever heard a pediatrician disclose that fact prior to administering vaccines? Or, any of the other serious adverse events (including death) listed on the insert? After numerous reports of \"premature ovarian failure\" in teen girls following the HPV series, Merck admitted that they had neglected to test Gardasil for \"impairment of fertility.\" \n\"The pediatrician serves as the recruiter for the medical profession. He\/she indoctrinates your child from birth into a life-long dependancy on medical intervention. The first stage of indoctrination is the \"well-baby\" visit. The well-baby visit is a cherished ritual of the pediatrician that enhances their income and does nothing constructive for your child. It's a worthless visit. Most doctors ignore the fact that the human body is a wonderous machine with an astonishing capacity to heal and repair itself. The best way to raise a healthy child is to keep them away from doctors unless it is a medical emergency. The greatest threat of childhood diseases lies in the dangerous and ineffectual efforts made to prevent them through mass immunisation. There is no convincing scientific evidence that mass inoculations can be credited with eliminating any childhood disease.\" -Dr Robert S. Mendelsohn, MD \nWe're not getting the truth about vaccines from \"official\" sources. For example, the rate of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) went down significantly in Sweden following their removel of Thimerosal from vaccines in 1992. But they sat on that data for 10 years so as to \"not hurt vaccine programs in other countries where Thimerosal is still used.\" Such as in the USA, where we were told that removing Thimerosal increased the incidence of autism; the opposite of what actually happened in Sweden. See the book \"Thimerosal, Let the Science Speak\"  \n Through several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, Dr Lucija Tomljenovic discovered that the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization) was fully aware of MMR vaccine dangers as early as 1989, but hid them. The JCVI made continuous efforts to withhold critical data on severe adverse reactions and contraindications to vaccinations. \"Official documents obtained from the U.K. Department of Health (DH) and the JCVI reveal that the British health authorities have been engaging in such practice for the last 30 years, apparently for the sole purpose of protecting the national vaccination program. Not only did the JCVI routinely ignore questions of safety as they came up with regards to the ever-expanding vaccination schedule, but the group actively censored unfavorable data that shed a \"negative\" light on vaccines in order to maintain the illusion that vaccines are safe and effective. Beyond this, the JCVI regularly lied to both the public and government authorities about vaccine safety in order to ensure that people continued to vaccinate their kids.\" See the full article at Natural News: Secret Government Documents Reveal Vaccines to be a Total Hoax  \n If you have pre-teen or teen girls, be sure to learn about the deaths and permanent disability after  the Gardasil\/HPV vaccine. As of August, 2014 VAERS lists 34,240 adverse events including 170 deaths. VAERS is a voluntary reporting system with, according to  a JAMA study, less than 1% of physicians reporting, so the real figures are 100X higher! That would be 3,424,000 adverse events and 17,000 deaths! You can search the VAERS database for adverse events for a given vaccine. \n If you are expecting a child, it's critical to absorb as much of this information as possible before your delivery date, so you can make an informed decision about whether to permit hospital staff to inject your newborn with formalin (aqueous solution of formaldehyde, aka \"embalming fluid\"), aluminum, MSG and other deadly neuro-toxins within a few hours and days of birth. Learn about the Hep B vaccine, \"the most neuro-destructive vaccine ever created\". Even the Merck package insert for Vitamin K (AquaMephyton\/Phytonadione) lists death as an adverse reaction, and this shot is standard procedure at hospitals so you must inform staff in advance, in writing with your instuctions to anything that varies from that standard. Use the free birth plan form at earthmamaangelbaby.com. Note that some hospital staff have disregarded parents' instructions, so never let your baby out of your sight, or sight of a family member. A home birth with a midwife would be ideal. This would prevent surrepticious vaccination as well as legal \"kidnapping\" which has occurred when staff fail to respect parental authority. Also, search natural birthing websites to learn why women are declining pitocin, and how doctors push C-section due to pressure from hospital administrators to approach the goal of making every birth a C-section birth! \n Some vaccines still contain mercury, primarily flu shots, and until recently, the rhogam shot given to RH negative women during pregnancy. Even so-called \"mercury free\" vaccines may still have a \"trace\" amount; but there is no safe amount of injected mercury. Fetuses and young children suffer the greatest risk because their nervous systems are still developing. They are four to five times more sensitive to mercury than adults. Mercury from flu shots taken while pregnant will cross the blood-placental barrier. Neither is there any safe amount of injected aluminum, but it is also added to vaccines and is highly reactive with mercury. A study in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry study showed that mice receiving an aluminum adjuvented vaccine showed significant motor neuron death (brain damage) and other neurologic damage. People at 55 years of age who receive the flu vaccine each year for 5 years in a row increase their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease a whopping 1,000%! \n  Vaccines contain spermacide such as Triton-X100 (octoxynol-10) and Polysorbate 80 (Tween) which enable the other toxic ingredients to cross the blood-brain barrier, or the blood-placental barrier, or even into the central nervous system, which can cause polio-like symptoms, or death, as in the cases of SIDS where infant's breathing muscles are paralyzed. They also can render your child sterile for life, especially when combined with the adjuvant Squalene.  Vaccine makers surely know that vaccines impair fertility but they try to maintain plausible deniability by adding this to package inserts: \"Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:  This vaccine has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or impairment of fertility.\" \n Vaccines often contain ethelyne glycol, formaldehyde, antibiotics and MSG. The MMR and other vaccines are cultured on \"human diploid cells\" which is tissue and organs of aborted fetuses, and DNA from those fetuses has been found in the final product. This can cause autoimmunity where your immune system destroys your own cells, including brain cells. Other remants of the manufacturing process remain as well, including unknown viruses which are not inactivated. Vaccines are not a vegan product, as animals are sacrificed to grow vaccine viruses on their organs. Two other highly toxic vaccine ingredients are beta-propriolactone and phenol; both known carcinogens. Note that injections of phenol were used as a means of individual execution by the Nazis during the Second World War, especially at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Approximately one gram is sufficient to cause death.  See the Table of Vaccine Ingredients and also on the CDC website. Highly recommended: This list enables you to click on each ingredient for detail on each one: Vaccine Ingredients and Manufacturer Information \n Vaccine proponents say that formaldehyde is not harmful, and is in fact \"natural.\" However they ignore the fact that it is a known human carcinogen and that the liquid version (formalin) is stabilized with methanol, also highly toxic. Read the data sheet on formaldehyde and judge for yourself if it is safe to inject into an infant. \"Ingestion of as little as 30 mL (1 oz.) of a solution containing 37% formaldehyde has been reported to cause death in an adult. Ingestion may cause corrosive injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa, with nausea, vomiting, pain, bleeding, and perforation. Corrosive injuries are usually most pronounced in the pharyngeal mucosa, epiglottis and esophagus. Systemic effects include metabolic acidosis, CNS depression and coma, respiratory distress, and renal failure.\" More... \n Over 3,000 parents or caregivers are in jail, having been convicted of murder because their child died after vaccination. This is because vaccines can cause brittle-bone syndrome and\/or brain bleeding which is then diagnosed as Shaken Baby Syndrome! The more this fact becomes known to prosecutors and judges, the less likely innocent parents will be unjustly targeted. One father has been released after six years in jail, when the judge was presented with the data on vaccine-injury, and a retrial was granted. Dr Gary Null's film \"Vaccine Nation\" covers this important case, as well as how government agencies conspire to hide vaccine-injury data.\n \"Vaccine induced nosebleeds: Does your child get nosebleeds? It could be a condition called immune thrombocytopenic purpura or ITP. Guess what caused 80% of hospital ITP admissions in one study? The deadly MMR vaccine in two year olds and under. Also found to cause ITP is the hepatitis A jab along with the chickenpox and TDaP shots. If your child gets a shot and then starts having chronic nosebleeds a few days or weeks or even months later, they might also be bleeding in the brain or other places you don't know about. Is the vaccine worth it? Not in my world.\" - Craig Stellpflug, NDC \n  ITP (immune thrombocytopenia purpura) is where the immune system destroys its own platelets and so the person bleeds easily. It can become very severe --even deadly-- if not treated. ITP can be triggered by the MMR vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control website, \"There has been growing concern that the live virus MMR vaccination is associated with an increased incidence of ITP.\" Research shows that most cases seem to come on in the 6-week period after a patient receives the Measles Mumps Rubella vaccine. However, MMR may not be the only vaccine to trigger ITP. If you recieved any type of vaccination in the weeks or months before the onset of immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura, it could have been triggered by that vaccine. Kimberly Jackson-Prater posts: \"My son was diagnosed with ITP at the age of 13 due to the chicken pox vaccine. For 2 years we lived in the children's hospital. His platelet count would get down to 1k which is the lowest amount they can drop to. They removed his spleen after 2 years and he has been in remission. We were told he needs a flu vaccine every fall but I'm scared it will bring back the ITP.\"  Sheree Adair-Winger posts: \"My son developed ITP within three weeks of his MMR. It was a nightmare! My son's ITP was severe with platelets at about 4K, instead of 200K. Lots of bruising, bleeding, petechiae, and other issues. Then he had to do the Anti-D which made him anemic and sick--vomiting, etc. In addition to costing about $20K. Blood draws every other day for a couple of months. It was not fun.

In California, five additional cases of polio-like symptoms appeared in children previously vaccinted for polio: \"The five children experienced paralysis of one or more arms or legs that came on suddenly and reached the height of its severity within two days of onset.

See History of Vaccination and Introduction to the Vaccine Controversy) \n How often do we hear pediatricians parrot the mantra, \"Vaccines do NOT cause autism.\" But often, the vaccine package insert lists \"autism\" as a reported adverse reaction. For example, the DTaP vaccine package insert says on page 11: \"Adverse events reported... include immune thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion\/grand mal, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea.\" So, perhaps doctors and nurses should read the package inserts. Parents too. Here is a list of links to package inserts for common vaccines. And more links to package inserts. \nAnd here are 22 Medical Studies That Show Vaccines Can Cause Autism. But what about the studies that purport to show no link?  Remember that failing to prove a link is not proof of no link. And it is very easy to set up studies so that the link is obfuscated; and then declare \"the data was insufficent to say conclusively, that there is a link.\" This is then reported on the nightly news as \"Study shows no link.\" So millions of children are being sacrificed on one word... \"conclusively.\" \n The CDC website states: \"About 1 in 6 children in the U.S. had a developmental disability in 2006-2008, ranging from mild disabilities such as speech and language impairments to serious developmental disabilities, such as intellectual disabilities, cerebral palsy, and autism.\" And yet, the CDC continues to expand their recommended vaccine schedule. When will it stop? \n PhD Scientist and Biochemist Reveals Hidden CDC Documents Showing Thimerosal In Vaccines Increases Neurologic Disorders \nAmerican Epilepsy Society Study (Lancet 2006): \"Vaccination, particularly for pertussis, has been implicated as a direct cause of an encephalopathy with refractory seizures and intellectual impairment. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 14 patients with alleged vaccine encephalopathy in whom the first seizure occurred within 72 hours of vaccination... INTERPRETATION: Cases of alleged vaccine encephalopathy could in fact be a genetically determined epileptic encephalopathy that arose de novo. These findings have important clinical implications for diagnosis and management of encephalopathy and, if confirmed in other cohorts, major societal implications for the general acceptance of vaccination.\" \nAluminum is known to cause brain damage, so why inject it into your infant? \"Aluminum hydroxide is used in vaccines to increase the body's production of antibodies, though no one knows how it works,\" says Purdue researcher Stanley Hem, professor of industrial and physical pharmacy. The Hepatitis B vaccine given at birth has 250 mcg, which is 20x the toxicity threshold. Based on FDA toxicity thresholds a 6 lb baby could not handle more than 11-14 mcg of aluminum. Average babies weigh close to 12 lbs at 2 months of age when they are injected with some 1,225 mcg of aluminum in their vaccines - 50 times the toxicity threshold. - Craig Stellpflug, NDC \nSevere adverse reactions are 50,000X more common that the \"one in a million\" that pediatricians are trained to say. Deaths from vaccination are hidden by using labels such as SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) or \"unknown causes\". The truth is,  vaccines are causing more death and permanent disability than the diseases they are purported to prevent. Including autism. And what may be even more shocking is that vaccines simply don't work. Vaccines don't offer any protection from disease, but often spread it.  But now, when a child vaccined for polio gets polio-like symptoms, doctors insist it couldn't be polio (after all, the child was vaccinated!) and instead call it Acute Flaccid Paralysis, Transverse Myelitis or Guillain Barre Syndrome, or Bell's Palsey. All of your  questions will be answered if you take the time to listen carefully to the facts these doctors are presenting. Any amount of time devoted to this learning process is worthwhile because the life of your child hangs in the balance... on your decisions regarding vaccination.  \n If you or a family member believe vaccines are safe and don't want to listen to the doctors featured on this site who say the evidence shows otherwise, please watch the feature film Hear The Silence. In it, you'll see how your life will change if your child is one of the \"1 in 50\" who revert into autism following vaccination. This made for television drama portrays the true story of a family with a vaccine-injured child. Also, highly recommened: The Greater Good, a documentary featuring three families with vaccine-injured children. And the hundreds of parental accounts in the \"Parents Speak Out\" menu at the top of this page. \n Doctors are required to obtain informed consent for any potentially harmful medical intervention, including vaccination. But most doctors do not inform parents about the risks of vaccination, which are listed on the package inserts. The claim that serious adverse events are rare is simply not true. Being fully informed can save the life of your child. And shield you from the fear and intimidation that people in positions of perceived authority often attempt in an effort to bully you into conforming to an agenda that is set by their employer (eg. hospital or school district).  \nIntussusception is a serious condition where part of the intestine slides into an adjacent part of the intestines, and it is the most common abdominal emergency to hit kids under the age of two. Usually the intestines become blocked. This results in the veins becoming compressed, the intestines swelling, and ultimately, obstruction. Reduced blood flow can actually kill the affected intestine, causing it to become gangrenous. Intussusception can cause internal bleeding, and it can even cause the intestine to rupture. Symptoms include cramps and abdominal pain which for infants seems like a colicky reaction, vomiting, and lack of appetite. Failure to catch this condition early or misdiagnosis can lead to death. According to the VAERS Database at the time of writing this article, of the nearly 11,000 adverse events reported in children under three after receiving a rotavirus vaccine, there are 532 incidents listed where a child under the age of 3 received a rotavirus vaccine and later presented with intussusception. Note: There were 542 cases, but age was unknown in 10 of them.\nThis study shows how vaccines spread disease:  Acellular pertussis vaccination enhances B. parapertussis colonization. Those who receive the shot can act as disease carriers, infecting others who are immune-compromised or who have lost the temporary immunity gained from previous shots. Only those children who have not been vaccinated, and who have instead developed lifelong immunity through natural exposure, obtain real protection. The reason for this is that vaccines override the body's innate, also called mucosal or non-specific, immune system. This system is the body's primary line of defense against bacteria, viruses, toxins and other harmful invaders, as it deals with these threats first so the body's second line of defense, the adaptive immune system, doesn't have to. However, with vaccines, the innate immune system is bypassed. This results in an unnatural immune response that not only fails to confer lifelong immunity but can also cause immune damage, leaving a person more susceptible to infection. Kerri F. wrote, \"My son had all the vaccines and almost died from whooping cough at 1 year old.\" \n \"Our research has focused on the effect of vaccines on insulin dependent diabetes, an autoimmune disease.\" \"We found that the incidence of diabetes rose 60% in New Zealand following a massive hepatitis B immunization program. The CDC initiated a study to verify our findings. Their preliminary data has been published and shows hepatitis B immunization when given starting after 8 weeks of age is associated with a 90% increase in the risk of diabetes, supporting our findings.\" \"All told we estimate that there are over 10,000 cases of vaccine induced diabetes in the US each year. On average each case may cost $1 million in lost productivity and medical expenses. The estimated liability cost of the vaccine induced diabetes is over $10 billion per year. The current cumulative liabilities to the US government and to manufacturers could exceed $250 billion. -J Barthelow Classen, MD \nIt can't be stressed enough that with rare exception, everything you hear about vaccines on mainstream media is false. For example, regarding the vaccine-autism link, we hear: \"Concerns about a vaccine-autism link began in 1998 when British researcher Dr Andrew Wakefield did a small study indicating a possible link. But that study has since been retracted and researchers have not been able to duplicate his findings.\" First of all, \"retracted\" implies that he changed his mind about his findings. He did not. He stands by it. It was the Lancet who \"retracted\" the publication of the study; not on any scientific basis, but simply on pressure from pharmaceutical corporations (the main source of income for the Lancet) and governmental agencies who would have stood to pay out millions to vaccine-damaged children, since the government had already indemnified the vaccine makers from any liability. Second, dozens of studies by others have since confirmed his findings. The gut-brain connection is now very well known. \n Pro-vaccine stakeholders make claims such as \"Anyone opposed to vaccination is either not educated, or doesn't understand science or the immune system.\" But, when you hear the presentations of the MDs, PhDs, and other doctors on this site, you'll see that, to the contrary, these doctors are highly educated and experienced professionals. And gradually, you'll realize that the continued slander towards anyone who questions vaccine safety is nothing more than a last ditch effort to protect financial interests and to shut down any legitimate inquiry that would threaten the corporate\/medical power\/profit\/control status quo. The science has been \"bought\" for profit, and what's best for your child is, sadly, not considered in their business model. \n","243":"                                         Vaccines Are Very Safe                                        \n                                         The United States' long-standing vaccine safety system ensures that vaccines are as safe as possible.

The agency ensures the safety, effectiveness, and availability of vaccines for the United States. Before a vaccine is approved by the FDA for use by the public, results of studies on safety and effectiveness of the vaccine are evaluated by highly trained FDA scientists and doctors. FDA also inspects the sites where vaccines are made to make sure they follow strict manufacturing guidelines.                                         \n                                         Although most common side effects of a vaccine are identified in studies before the vaccine is licensed, rare adverse events may not be detected in these studies. Therefore, the U.S. vaccine safety system continuously monitors for possible side effects after a vaccine is licensed. When millions of people receive a vaccine, less common side effects that were not identified earlier may                                          be detected.                                        \n                                         If a link is found between a possible side effect and a vaccine, public health officials take appropriate action. First, additional studies will be quickly conducted to determine if there is an association between the vaccine and the side effect. If additional studies indicate a true association between the vaccine and the side effect, then public health experts will weigh the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change.                                        \n                                         Monitoring Vaccine Safety - Why is it important to monitor vaccine safety?                                        \n                                         Vaccines are held to the highest standard of safety. The United States currently has the safest, most effective vaccine supply in history. Years of testing are required before a vaccine can be licensed. Once in use, vaccines are continually monitored for safety and efficacy.                                        \n                                         Vaccines, like any medication, can cause adverse events. However, a decision not to immunize a child also involves risk. It is a decision to put the child and others who come into contact with him or her at risk of contracting a disease that could be dangerous or deadly.                                        \n                                         Vaccine Side Effects                                        \n                                         Like any medication, vaccines, can cause side effects. The most common side effects are mild. On the other hand, many vaccine-preventable disease symptoms can be serious, or even deadly. Even though many of these diseases are rare in this country, they still occur around the world and can be brought into the United States, putting unvaccinated children at risk.                                        \n                                         The side effects associated with getting vaccines are almost always mild (such as redness and swelling where the shot was given) and go away within a few days. If your child experiences a reaction at the injection site, you can use a cool, wet cloth to reduce redness, soreness, and swelling.                                        \n                                         Serious side effects following vaccination, such as severe allergic reaction, are very rare and doctors and clinic staff are trained to deal with them.

What matters is the science, and nothing else.\nThe Emerging Scientific Story of Vaccine Injury\n In recent years, powerful scientific evidence has emerged indicating that vaccines cause brain injury\u00c2\u00a0such as autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, attention-deficit disorder and other mental illnesses. This scientific evidence has been largely ignored by the media, and by medical institutions that are supposedly\u00c2\u00a0guided by science.\nVaccinepapers.org provides detailed, science-based and objective information about the dangers of vaccines. We are\u00c2\u00a0most concerned about aluminum adjuvant toxicity and immune activation-mediated brain injury. Vaccinepapers.org is the first to make this hugely important scientific research accessible to the public.\nAluminum Adjuvant Toxicity\n It is now known that aluminum adjuvants are not safely eliminated from the body, as assumed by vaccine advocates. Rather, they are taken up by immune system cells\u00c2\u00a0(macrophages) and transported\u00c2\u00a0around the body, including into the brain. Aluminum adjuvant can cause brain injury\u00c2\u00a0and autoimmune diseases.\nImmune Activation Brain Injury\n Human brain development is controlled by immune-system signals (i.e. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cytokines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Activation of the immune system during brain development causes disruptions in these signals, resulting in permanent brain injury. The injury manifests as autism, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Adverse vaccine reactions are proven to stimulate a cytokine (interleukin-6) proven to cause autism. There is a large amount of research on this, by many laboratories around the world, but the connection to vaccines is\u00c2\u00a0being\u00c2\u00a0overlooked.\n Aluminum and Immune Activation\n Aluminum and immune activation are connected, because aluminum triggers immune activation, and interleukin-6 specifically. Aluminum stimulates IL-6 in the brain. Aluminum also stimulates Th2 activation, a type of immune activation shown to impair brain development in animal studies. So the issues of aluminum adjuvant toxicity and immune activation are connected.\nOur perspective:\n Like any other medical treatment, vaccination must be justified in view of an objective risk\/benefit analysis. All risks and benefits must be considered. Any rational medical treatment must do more good than harm. This is universally accepted.\nThe problem with vaccines is that risks have been underestimated, and the benefits overestimated. In particular, the risk of brain injury\u00c2\u00a0from vaccines is much higher than commonly believed. Brain injury\u00c2\u00a0can be devastating to the life of a child, and the child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family. The personal and financial costs of vaccine injury are often enormous. Therefore, even a small risk of brain injury\u00c2\u00a0must be considered seriously. And the science strongly suggests that the risk is not small.\nVaccinepapers.org\u00c2\u00a0is not ideologically opposed to all vaccines, but we are unaware of any specific vaccine that has an acceptable level of proven safety, especially for infants, and especially if it contains aluminum adjuvant. However, some vaccines may be\u00c2\u00a0worth the risk for some people in some situations. The risk of a vaccine depends greatly on the adjuvant (type and amount), the type and magnitude of immune activation it stimulates, the presence of other substances (e.g. antigens with allergenic potential), and the susceptibilities and health history of the recipient. There is not nearly enough science available to accurately estimate these\u00c2\u00a0contributors to risk.\nHowever, we do not make recommendations regarding specific vaccines. We urge careful consideration\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0the risk of serious and permanent harm, including disabling brain injury, long-term immune disorders and death. Determining which vaccines, if any, are worth the risk is a decision left to the reader.\nUs and Them\n We denounce the personal attacks, insults and harassment\u00c2\u00a0pursued by\u00c2\u00a0some in the vaccine debate (on all sides). We do not do this. We ask critics of Vaccinepapers to be respectful and not engage in this behavior.\nWe assume that\u00c2\u00a0both sides\u00c2\u00a0in this debate share the same goal: a medical system that maximizes health. We do not demonize people of the opposition\u00c2\u00a0as monsters intending to harm (however, pharmaceutical companies appear to have deeply disturbing motivations, since they profit greatly from chronic illnesses).\nThe vaccine debate has been in the gutter for far too long. There are important issues raised by recent scientific findings that deserve consideration. Society will benefit the most from a rational, polite debate about them. We seek to positively contribute to this debate.\n Why should I not trust the advice given by the majority of health care professionals in the world when it comes to something as important as preventing highly contagious and possibly deadly diseases?\n Two reasons:\n1) Because medical science is the most corrupt of the sciences. It is extremely corrupt. Big pharma companies pay to have fake scientific papers written and published. Big pharma funds the medical science journals with advertising and reprint fees. Big pharma influences research and curriculum at medical schools. Big pharma pays for speaking fees and accommodations at medical-scientific conferences. Big pharma funds most medical research. So, the people selling the treatments are the ones that have the most influence over the direction\u00c2\u00a0of medicine: what ideas are acceptable and supported, and what ideas are neglected and discarded. And anything that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make them money (i.e. that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-patentable) is neglected, or denounced.\n2) Medicine has a blind spot when it comes to iatrogenic (doctor-caused) diseases and damage. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s psychologically distressing for doctors to be confronted with evidence\u00c2\u00a0that they have caused\u00c2\u00a0great harm to patients.\u00c2\u00a0Its difficult for orthodox medicine to objectively consider the science because they face the blame for the epidemic of vaccine injury. This creates a powerful incentive to believe vaccines are safe. Accordingly, orthodox medicine engages in motivated reasoning on the subject of vaccine injury. \u00c2\u00a0Combine corruption with the motivated reasoning, and\u00c2\u00a0the result is\u00c2\u00a0a medical system\u00c2\u00a0that makes incredibly bad decisions and harms millions of people.\nAn example of the hostility doctors display in response to discoveries of doctor-caused diseases is the story of Dr. Semmelweis. In the 1840s, he discovered that doctors were causing deadly infections in women by delivering babies with dirty hands. Doctors would\u00c2\u00a0go back and forth between the morgue and the delivery room without washing. Semmelweis proved that it was the unclean doctors causing the deaths, which they did not appreciate. Semmelweis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s discovery blamed his colleagues for killing people. Instead of being praised and rewarded for his important discovery, Semmelweis was ridiculed, viciously attacked and hounded out of medicine. And all Semmelweis was trying to do was convince other doctors to wash their hands! It took about 20 years until Semmelweis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendations were in widespread use.\nAre you saying that doctors and medical professionals don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look at the science? If so, why?\n Correct. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Doctors and public health people spend little time reading the literature for themselves. They foolishly trust the CDC and industry-funded trade groups to interpret the science and make recommendations for them, which they follow. The vaccine industry writes the vaccine recommendations. Doctors and most medical professionals are not independent thinkers. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the time or interest. Most simply follow the\u00c2\u00a0conventional\u00c2\u00a0recommendations and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t question them. But what if the conventional recommendations are wrong? Medical consensus has been wrong many times in the past.\nWhy should I trust you? You guys are just doing this for the money!\n Vaccinepapers.org makes no money, and never will.

For them, all that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s required to answer the questions of vaccine dangers is to assert\u00c2\u00a0the CDC, WHO, and AAP as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153authorities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and parrot what they say. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so easy! No need to look at the science, or think for yourself, according to vaccine advocates. This is absolutely foolish.\nScientific ideas and opinions must be judged by the evidence, not according to whether the source is perceived as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153authority\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. All that really matters is the science and the evidence. To determine if VP is trustworthy, all you have to do is consider the opinions on these pages in view of what the science says. Then do the same for the CDC, WHO, AAP and other so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153authorities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nSo don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take our word for the claims made here. Read the scientific evidence for yourself.\nTwo of the most accomplished scientists of the 20th century\u00c2\u00a0advocate this approach.

Children older than six, adolescents, and adults may get a similar vaccine, Tdap or Td.\nTd is a tetanus and diphtheria vaccine given to preteens, teens, and adults as a booster shot every 10 years, or after an exposure to tetanus under some circumstances.\u00c2\u00a0\nTdap is similar to Td, but also contains protection against pertussis. Tdap should be given as a one-time booster in place of Td.\u00c2\u00a0Tdap is especially important for those in close contact with infants.\nPreteens and teens 11 through 18 years old (preferably at age 11-12 years old) should receive a single dose of Tdap.\nAdults 19 years or older who did not receive Tdap as a preteen or teen should also receive a single dose of Tdap.\nPregnant women should receive a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks to maximize that amount of protective antibodies passed to the baby, but the vaccine can be safely given at any time during pregnancy.\nNew mothers who have never gotten Tdap should get a dose as soon as possible after delivery.\nTdap should also be given to 7 through 10-year-olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.\u00c2\u00a0\nTdap can be given no matter when Td (tetanus and diphtheria vaccine) was last received.\nNote: Upper-case letters in these vaccine abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case \u00e2\u20ac\u0153d\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153p\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent\/adult-formulations. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in DTaP and Tdap stands for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153acellular,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\nTetanus is an infection caused by bacteria. When the bacteria invade the body, they produce a toxin, or poison, that causes painful muscle contractions. Tetanus infection mainly affects the neck and abdomen. Tetanus is also called \"lockjaw\" because it often causes a person's neck and jaw muscles to lock, making it hard to open the mouth or swallow. It can also cause breathing problems, severe muscle spasms, seizures, and paralysis. Complete recovery can take months. If left untreated, tetanus can be fatal.\nTetanus is different from other vaccine-preventable diseases in that it does not spread from person-to-person. The bacteria are usually found in soil, dust, and manure and enter the body through breaks in the skin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c usually cuts or puncture wounds.\nEveryone needs protection from tetanus. The DTaP vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) can help prevent tetanus in young children. DTaP shots are recommended for healthy babies at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, and again at 15 through 18 months. A DTaP booster is recommended for children ages 4 through 6 years old.\nBecause immunity to tetanus decreases over time, older children need to get the Tdap vaccine. This booster shot contains a full concentration of tetanus and lower concentrations of diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough). The Tdap vaccine is recommended for all 11-18 year olds, preferably given to preteens going to the doctor for a regular check-up at 11 or 12 years old.\n  Because immunity to tetanus decreases over time, adults also need to get a booster shot every 10 years to stay protected. For adults who haven't gotten Tdap yet, the easiest thing to do is to get Tdap instead of their next regular tetanus booster. The dose of Tdap can be given earlier than the 10-year mark, so it's a good idea for adults to talk to a doctor about what's best for their specific situation. Make sure you and your child are protected against tetanus.\t\t\t\t\nVaccine Information Statements (VIS) for the Td vaccine, the TdaP vaccine, or the DTaP vaccine describe the benefits and risks of each vaccine.

In children, the disease is usually mild with fever and a rash. But, if a pregnant woman gets infected, the virus can cause serious birth defects. Rubella can be prevented with vaccination.\nChildren should receive two doses of MMR vaccine:\nMMRV vaccine is licensed for children 12 months to 12 years old and may be used in place of MMR vaccine if varicella vaccination is also needed. A health care provider can help decide which vaccine to use.\nMMR vaccine is very safe and effective. MMR vaccine is the best way to protect children against rubella and to prevent them from spreading the disease to pregnant women and their unborn babies.\nAnyone born during or after 1957, who has never had rubella or has never been vaccinated, against rubella should receive at least one dose of MMR vaccine. If you are not sure if you are protected against rubella, first try to find your vaccination records or documentation of rubella immunity. If you do not have written documentation of rubella immunity, you should get MMR vaccine. Another option is to have a doctor test your blood to determine whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re immune, but this is likely to cost more and will take two doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visits. There is no harm in getting another dose of MMR vaccine if you may already be immune to rubella.\nWomen who are planning to become pregnant should make sure they have a pre-pregnancy blood test to see if they are immune to rubella. Most women of childbearing age were vaccinated as children with the MMR vaccine, but they should confirm this with their doctor. If they need to get vaccinated for rubella, they should avoid becoming pregnant until one month (28 days) after receiving the MMR vaccine and, ideally, not until your immunity is confirmed by a blood test.\nPregnant women who are not protected against rubella should wait until after they have given birth to get MMR vaccine.\nRubella is an infectious disease caused by a virus.\u00c2\u00a0It is also known as German measles or three-day measles, but it is not the same disease as measles. Young children who get rubella usually have a mild illness, with symptoms that can include a low-grade fever, sore throat, and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Older children and adults are more likely to have a headache, pink eye, and general discomfort before the rash appears.\nRubella is usually spread to others through sneezing or coughing. In young children, rubella is usually mild, with symptoms that include a low-grade fever, sore throat, and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Older children and adults are more likely to experience headache, pink eye, and general discomfort before the rash appears. Aching joints occur in many cases, especially among young women. The most serious complication from rubella infection is the harm it can cause to a pregnant woman's unborn baby.\nAnyone who is not immune from either previous rubella infection or from vaccination can get rubella. While rubella was declared \u00c2\u00a0eliminated from the United States in 2004, the disease still occurs in other countries. Therefore, unvaccinated people can get rubella while abroad can bring the disease into the United States and spread it to others.\nIf an unvaccinated pregnant woman gets infected with rubella virus it can lead to miscarriage, or her baby can die before or just after birth. Also, she can pass the virus to her unborn baby who can develop serious birth defects, such as heart problems, loss of hearing and eyesight, intellectual disability, and liver or spleen damage.\nSerious birth defects are more common if a woman is infected early in her pregnancy, especially in the first 12 weeks. In fact, women infected with rubella early in pregnancy have a 1 in 5 chance of having problems with the pregnancy.\nMeasles: A contagious viral disease marked by the eruption of red circular spots on the skin.\nMumps: Acute contagious viral illness marked by swelling, especially of the parotid glands.\nVirus: A tiny organism that multiplies within cells and causes disease such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis and hepatitis.

The vast majority of rabies cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year occur in wild animals like raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes.\nRabies vaccine is given to people at increased risk of rabies to protect them if they are exposed. It can also prevent the disease if it is given to a person after they have been exposed.\nRabies vaccine is made from killed rabies virus. It cannot cause rabies.\nPeople at increased risk of exposure to rabies, such as veterinarians, animal handlers, rabies laboratory workers, spelunkers, and rabies biologics production workers should be offered rabies vaccine.\nThe vaccine should also be considered for:\nThe pre-exposure schedule for rabies vaccination is three doses, given at the following times:\n2nd dose: 7 days after the first dose\n3rd dose: 21 days or 28 days after the second dose\nFor laboratory workers and others who may be repeatedly exposed to rabies virus, periodic testing for immunity is recommended, and booster doses should be given as needed. Testing or booster doses are not recommended for travelers. Ask your doctor for details.\nAnyone who has been bitten by an animal, or who otherwise may have been exposed to rabies, should clean the wound and see a doctor immediately. The doctor will determine if they need to be vaccinated.\nA person who is exposed and has never been vaccinated against rabies should get four doses of rabies vaccine - one dose right away, and additional doses on the third, seventh and fourteenth days. They should also get another shot called Rabies Immune Globulin at the same time as the first dose.\nA person who has been previously vaccinated should get two doses of rabies vaccine - one right away and another on the third day. Rabies Immune Globulin is not needed.\nRabies is a serious disease caused by a virus, and is mainly a disease of animals. Humans get rabies when they are bitten by infected animals.\nThe first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days. There may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of bite, progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, and agitation.\nThe Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for the rabies vaccine describes the benefits and risks of the vaccine.

Much of the immune system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work is carried out by an army of various specialized cells, each type designed to fight disease in a particular way. The invading microbes first run into the vanguard of this army, which includes\u00c2\u00a0white blood cells called macrophages (literally, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big eaters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). The macrophages engulf as many of the microbes as they can.\nHow do the macrophages recognize the microbes? All cells and microbes wear a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uniform\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd made up of molecules that cover their surfaces. Each human cell displays unique marker molecules unique to you. Microbes display different marker molecules unique to them. The macrophages and other cells of your immune system use these markers to distinguish among the cells that are part of your body, harmless bacteria that reside in your body, and harmful invading microbes that need to be destroyed.\nThe molecules on a microbe that identify it as foreign and stimulate the immune system to attack it are called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153antigens.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Every microbe carries its own unique set of antigens, which are central to creating vaccines.\nMacrophages digest most parts of the microbes but save the antigens and carry them back to the lymph nodes, bean-sized organs scattered throughout your body where immune system cells congregate. In these nodes, macrophages sound the alarm by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regurgitating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the antigens, displaying them on their surfaces so other cells, such as specialized defensive white blood cells called lymphocytes, can recognize them.\nThere are two major kinds of lymphocytes, T cells and B cells, and they do their own jobs in fighting off infection. T cells function either offensively or defensively. The offensive T cells don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attack the microbe directly, but they use chemical weapons to eliminate the human cells\u00c2\u00a0that have already been infected. Because they have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153programmed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by their exposure to the microbe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antigen, these cytotoxic T cells, also called killer T cells, can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd diseased cells that are harboring the microbe. The killer T cells latch onto these cells and release chemicals that destroy the infected cells and the microbes inside.\nThe defensive T cells, also called helper T cells, defend the body by secreting chemical signals that direct the activity of other immune system cells. Helper T cells assist in activating killer T cells, and helper T cells also stimulate and work closely with B cells. The work done by T cells is called the cellular or cell-mediated immune response.\nB cells\u00c2\u00a0make and secrete extremely important molecular weapons called antibodies. Antibodies usually work by first grabbing onto the microbe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antigen, and then sticking to and coating the microbe. Antibodies and antigens fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle\u00e2\u20ac\u201dif their shapes are compatible, they bind to each other.\nEach antibody can usually fit with only one antigen. The immune system keeps a supply of millions and possibly billions of different antibodies on hand to be prepared for any foreign invader.\u00c2\u00a0It does this by constantly creating millions of new B cells. About 50 million B cells circulate in each teaspoonful of human blood, and almost every B cell\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthrough random genetic shuffling\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproduces a unique antibody that it displays on its surface.\nWhen these B cells come into contact with their matching microbial antigen, they are stimulated to divide into many larger cells, called plasma cells, which secrete mass quantities of antibodies to bind to the microbe.\nThe antibodies secreted by B cells circulate throughout the human body and attack the microbes that have not yet infected any cells but are lurking in the blood or the spaces between cells. When antibodies gather on the surface of a microbe, it becomes unable to function. Antibodies signal macrophages and other defensive cells to come eat the microbe. Antibodies also work with other defensive molecules that circulate in the blood, called complement proteins, to destroy microbes.\nThe work of B cells is called the humoral immune response, or simply the antibody response. The goal of most vaccines is to stimulate this response. In fact, many infectious microbes can be defeated by antibodies alone, without any help from killer T cells.\nWhen T cells and antibodies begin to eliminate the microbe faster than it can reproduce,\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0immune system finally has the upper hand. Gradually, the virus disappears from the body.\nAfter the body eliminates the disease, some microbe-fighting B cells and T cells are converted into memory cells. Memory B cells can quickly divide into plasma cells and make more antibody if needed. Memory T cells can divide and grow into a microbe-fighting army. If re-exposure to the infectious microbe occurs, the immune system will quickly recognize how to stop the infection.\nVaccines teach the immune system by mimicking a natural infection. For example, the yellow fever vaccine, first widely used in 1938, contains a weakened form of the virus that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause disease or reproduce very well.\u00c2\u00a0Human\u00c2\u00a0macrophages can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell that the vaccine viruses are weakened, so they engulf the viruses as if they were dangerous.\u00c2\u00a0In the lymph nodes, the macrophages present yellow fever antigen to T cells and B cells.\nA response from yellow-fever-specific T cells is activated. B cells secrete yellow fever antibodies. The weakened viruses in the vaccine are quicky eliminated. The mock infection is cleared, and humans are left with a supply of memory T and B cells for future protection against yellow fever.\nback to top\n","250":"Chickenpox vaccine is very effective. Two doses of the vaccine are about 98% effective at preventing chickenpox. Some people who are vaccinated against chickenpox may still get the disease. However, it is usually milder with fewer skin blisters and little or no fever.\nGetting chickenpox vaccine is much safer than getting chickenpox disease. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it. Learn more about possible side effects of chickenpox vaccines.\nThe second dose may be given at an earlier age if it is given at least three months after the first dose.\nPeople 13 years or older (who have never had chickenpox and never received chickenpox vaccine) should get two doses at least 28 days apart.\nMMRV is licensed for use in children 12 months to 12 years old. Your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doctor can help you decide which vaccine to use.\nHowever, pregnant women should wait to get the chickenpox vaccine until after they have given birth. Women should not get pregnant for 1 month after getting the chickenpox vaccine.\nChickenpox is caused by varicella zoster virus. The main symptom of chickenpox is a rash that turns into itchy, fluid-filled blisters and spreads all over the body. Other typical symptoms that may begin to appear 1 to 2 days before the rash include high fever, tiredness, loss of appetite and headache.\nChickenpox is very contagious and spreads easily from infected people. It can spread from either a cough or a sneeze. It can also spread by contact with virus particles that come from the blisters on the skin, either by touching them or by breathing in virus particles.\nA person with chickenpox is contagious 1 to 2 days before the rash appears until all blisters have formed scabs. It takes from 10 to 21 days after exposure for someone to develop chickenpox.\nChickenpox is usually mild, but it can lead to complications, such as severe skin infection, bone and joint infections, dehydration, pneumonia, brain damage, or death. It is not possible to predict who will have a mild case of chickenpox and who will have a serious or even deadly case of disease.\nAfter a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus stays in the body and can re-activate years later to cause a painful condition called shingles.\nAnyone who is not immune from either previous chickenpox virus infection or from vaccination can get chickenpox. Certain groups of people are more likely to have more severe illness with serious complications. These include adults, infants, adolescents, and people whose immune systems have been weakened because of illness or medications.\nChickenpox used to be very common in the United States. About 4 million people would get the disease each year. Also, about 10,600 people were hospitalized and 100 to 150 died each year because of chickenpox.\nThanks to vaccination, serious cases and deaths from chickenpox have declined dramatically. Since the United States started using the vaccine in 1996, the number of hospitalizations decreased by 84% and deaths from chickenpox have gone down more than 90%.\nVaccine Information Statements (VIS) for the MMRV vaccine or the chickenpox vaccine describe the benefits and risks of each vaccine.

It results from infection with the hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis B can be either \u00e2\u20ac\u0153acute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chronic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Acute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hepatitis B virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first six months after someone is exposed to the hepatitis B virus. Acute infection can\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut does not always\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlead to chronic infection.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chronic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0hepatitis B virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the hepatitis B virus remains in a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hepatitis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd means inflammation of the liver. Toxins, certain drugs, some diseases, heavy alcohol use, and bacterial and viral infections can all cause hepatitis. Hepatitis is also the name of a family of viral infections that affect the liver; the most common types are hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.\nHepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are diseases caused by three different viruses. Although each can cause similar symptoms, they have different modes of transmission and can affect the liver differently. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also begin as acute infections, but in some people, the virus remains in the body, resulting in chronic disease and long-term liver problems.\nHepatitis B is not spread by sharing eating utensils, breastfeeding, hugging, kissing, holding hands, coughing, or sneezing. Hepatitis B is not spread routinely through food or water.\nHowever, there have been instances in which hepatitis B has been spread to babies when they have received food pre-chewed by an infected person.\nHepatitis B is spread when blood, semen, or other body fluid infected with the hepatitis B virus enters the body of a person who is not infected. People can become infected with the virus during activities such as:\nBirth (spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth).\nSex with an infected partner.\nSharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment.\nSharing items such as razors or toothbrushes with an infected person.\nDirect contact with the blood or open sores of an infected person.\nExposure to blood from needlesticks or other sharp instruments.\nMany people with chronic hepatitis B virus infection do not know they are infected since they do not feel or look sick. However, they still can spread the virus to others and are at risk of serious health problems themselves.\nAlthough a majority of adults develop symptoms from acute hepatitis B virus infection, many young children do not. Adults and children over the age of 5 years are more likely to have symptoms. Seventy percent of adults will develop symptoms from the infection.\nSymptoms of acute Hepatitis B, if they appear, can include:\nOn average, symptoms appear 90 days (or 3 months) after exposure, but they can appear any time between 6 weeks and 6 months after exposure.\nAlthough anyone can get hepatitis B, in the United States, certain groups of people are at higher risk, such as those who:\nHave sex with an infected person.\nHave multiple sex partners.\nHave a sexually transmitted disease.\nAre men who have sexual contact with other men.\nInject drugs or share needles, syringes, or other drug equipment.\nLive with a person who has chronic hepatitis B.\nAre infants born to infected mothers.\nAre exposed to blood on the job.\nTravel to countries with moderate to high rates of hepatitis B.\nThe younger a person is when infected with hepatitis B virus, the greater his or her chance of developing chronic hepatitis B. Approximately 90% of infected infants will develop chronic infection. The risk goes down as a child gets older. Approximately 25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c50% of children infected between the ages of one and five years will develop chronic hepatitis. The risk drops to 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10% when a person is infected over five years of age.

So most Americans are clueless about the fact that the most crucial information regarding this matter is not on TV or in the newspapers. However, on page 5 of a 14-page PDF on the CDC web site, the public is nevertheless warned:\nFecal shedding of vaccine virus was evaluated in a subset of persons enrolled in the phase III trials. Vaccine virus was shed by 9% of 360 infants after dose 1, but none of 249 and 385 infants after doses 2 and 3, respectively. Shedding was observed as early as 1 day and as late as 15 days after a dose. The potential for transmission of vaccine virus was not assessed in trials. In a post-licensure evaluation in the United States, stool samples were collected from infants for 9 days following the first dose. Rotavirus antigen was detected in stool of 21% of 103 infants, as early as day 3 post vaccination and as late as day 9.\nIn truth, vaccinated people are still incurring weakened immunity from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccines and are therefore more susceptible to getting sick from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shedders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the vaccinated.\nSources:\n","258":"How measles can change a life\nMarch 21, 2014 @ 6:02 pm\n31 Jan\nHow measles can change a life\nIn the early 1990s we lived in  Berlin, Germany. We were young and full of plans for the future. My wife Anke  was working as a nurse and I had just started my professional career as an  engineer. We became a little family when Julian, our older son, was born in the  spring of 1992. We built our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, had great friends and neighbours, and  simply enjoyed life as a young family.\nAs most parents probably are, we  were very grateful and thankful. Two years later, during the summer of 1994,  our second child, Maximilian, saw the light of day and made our family  happiness complete. Back then, we had not the slightest idea of how dramatically  our lives would change some years later.\nMax turned out to be a blessing  and a challenge at the same time: he was so full of energy and life that it was  sometimes hard to keep him under control. But he was very charming, even as a  baby. He won the hearts of the people around him in no time.\nMax in 2005\n\u00c2\u00a0\nWhen he got sick in the winter of  1994\/1995, we were a bit worried because of his young age. After all, he was  only six months old when measles hit him badly. It had been way too early for  vaccination, but not too early for infection. He spent several days with a high  fever while his paediatrician feared that he would develop some sort of  complications. And he did: his lungs got affected, he developed a dry cough,  and sometimes he even had difficulties breathing. We were concerned, but had no  clue and nobody had ever mentioned anything about potentially fatal measles  complications.\nAfter a few weeks everything was  over. Max had recovered and as spring came around, the vivid, high-energy boy  was back. What we did not know back then was that he would only stay with us  for another 10 years.\nWhen Max was in third grade of  elementary school his performance in math suddenly dropped.\nInitially we thought that it  might have to do with his high energy level and his difficulty concentrating  sometimes. But then he started showing some strange behaviours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only for short  moments, but becoming more frequent. We did not realise that these were the  first signs\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nIn October of 2004 the first  seizure occurred. Max would stop doing anything \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from one second to the other \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he would sit and stare. Just for a few seconds or sometimes a minute. When  the seizure was over, he could not remember anything. We learned that this kind  of seizure is called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcabsence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\nThe doctors told us that  sometimes children would develop this kind of epilepsy when they were just  about to enter puberty. So we thought that maybe it would be temporary and  eventually go away. But there was a bad sign: Max\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EEG that was taken shortly  after his first seizure was entirely abnormal. There were curve patterns that  did not belong there. The doctors tried to control the seizures by a special  mix of anticonvulsants. And actually it did help \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for a few weeks.\nBetween December of 2004 and  February of 2005 our beloved boy seemed to be back. We thought that finally we  had everything under control and that the seizures would eventually go away. We  didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about him not going to school anymore, because he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep up  with the lessons.\nWe ignored the fact that he could  not remember things that had just happened a few hours before.\nWe ignored the fact that his  behaviour became more\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6We just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to realise what was happening.\nThe seizures came back in March.  Heavy, frequent and different. The doctors sent us to one of the best epilepsy  centres in Germany at Kehl-Kork. They only needed a few examinations to confirm  the worst suspicions: Max was diagnosed with SSPE, Subacute Sclerosing  Panencephalitis, a late complication of an early age measles disease. Rare, but  fatal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in any case, without exception.\nIt was very hard for us to  realise that they were talking about our bright, happy, vivid 10-year-old boy.\nWe were numb, desperate, did not  understand that the doctors were telling us that we would lose our child \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no  matter what, just a matter of when.\nWe fought hard for a long time.  We spent nights on the internet seeking for rescue, for some sort of treatment  that would stop us from going down the path of the inevitable. We established  contacts with medical scientists in India, Turkey and the US. We imported  homeopathic medicine from India; we applied \u00c3\u0178-interferon, vitamins, fish oil,  minerals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all the good stuff.\nBut fate sometimes is relentless:  in April of 2006 our boy said good-bye forever. An unexpected thrust of brain  inflammation put him into a vegetative state. Within only hours he lost  everything he had learned during his young life. His last words were: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t  know who you are\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to haunt us for the rest of our lives.\nThe following years were  characterised by despair, disbelief, unrealistic hope, and many illusions, by  anger, and by a very slow process of realising that he will never come back.  But above all, there was and still is the everlasting daily struggle to somehow  survive as a family. After all, Max\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother\nJulian had just turned 12 when  our family was hit by this tragedy. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at least he deserve to spend his  teenage years in an environment that provided as much normality as possible?\nMax in 2012\n\u00c2\u00a0\nToday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the age of 18 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Maximilian is still with us. His condition has slowly, but steadily worsened  over the years. He can no longer sit or hold his head up. After all those years  in which he could at least be fed like a baby, his chewing and swallowing  capabilities have lately ceased significantly. His body temperature regulation  is unstable; he has many seizures, unpredictable, sometimes strong, sometimes  barely noticeable. We feed him by a stomach tube and carry him around in his  wheel chair. His level of reaction to his environment varies from little to  none. When a day is exceptionally good, he would laugh at Mom or Dad, or his  brother, or his nurse when they caress him and talk to him.\nMax will die. Nobody knows when  or how, but it is inevitable. And we have no idea, if and how we as a family  are going to survive this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 But what drives us crazy is the fact that all of  this could have been avoided, had obligatory vaccination protected more  children from getting infected by measles and other dangerous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153childhood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd diseases.\nThe measles virus is extremely  dangerous. Thousands of children around the world suffer from acute  complications such as heart problems, deafness, eye infection, meningitis,  hepatitis, bronchitis, Krupp cough, and of course the rare ones like infections  of the optic nerve or SSPE.\nOther severe diseases such as  pox, plague, or poliomyelitis are almost eliminated on this planet, because  better hygiene and protection by vaccination has successfully pushed back those  infections.\nSo why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we learn? Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it a  shame for a developed country like Germany that measles are still an issue?\nWhen it comes to vaccination,  parents are not responsible for their own children only \u00e2\u20ac\u201c their decision pro or  against vaccination may have a significant impact on others! There are proven  cases of babies being infected by measles while sitting in a pediatrician\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s  waiting room. Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that cynical? One of these children died a year ago, from  SSPE.\nLooking back and considering how  life could have been is hurtful. Max did not deserve what has happened to him.  It is almost unbearable to accept the fact that under different circumstances  or if we had lived in another country back at that time our child would most  likely still be healthy. We have lost him forever and it is breaking our  hearts. Only in our memories we still see him and he makes us smile. Sometimes  the thought of him is choking us. We do not know how long Max will still stay  with us, but we will care for him until the end.\n*Editor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s update: It is with sadness that we report the death of Max in February 2014*\nAbout Ruediger Schoenbohm\nRuediger Schoenbohm (48), married to Anke (48), is father of two sons, Julian (20) and Maximilian (18).  In 2007, 2 years after his younger son Maximilian was diagnosed with SSPE, the electrical engineer founded together with his wife and friends of the family the association \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aktion-max e.V.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It offers information about SSPE and its treatment and helps establishing contacts with experts, doctors and affected families around the world. Also, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aktion-max\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd offers help and networking for those families who are hit by the fate of SSPE. The association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s webpage www.aktion-max.de contains regular updates on Maximilian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situation and media links. During the past 6 years \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aktion-max\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has initiated or supported several public initiatives to educate the public about the danger of measles, their potential complications such as SSPE, and the risks of lacking childhood immunization. The family and the association are based in the greater Stuttgart area, Germany.\n","259":"According to a front page article of the St. Louis Post Dispatch, dated July 17, 2013, Missourians are being offered a free Tdap vaccine in July to protect them against the reported rising incidence of pertussis or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whooping cough.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The vaccine is being offered to residents aged 11 and older. [1] \nIt is reported that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Tdap vaccine is a single vaccination that prevents tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The cause of the rising incidence of whooping cough is reported to be related to the vaccine wearing off if given more than ten years earlier. According to the report, more than 41,000 pertussis cases occurred across the United States in 2012, compared to 18,719 cases in 2011.\nThe news story emphasized that whooping cough is highly dangerous and can lead to vomiting and death, especially in children. The report indicates that diphtheria is a bacterial disease that is highly contagious and can also lead to death.\nTetanus causes intense muscle spasms, according to the article.\nThis news piece fails to report on the serious health risks associated with the Tdap vaccinations, the relatively benign health complications commonly associated with these diseases, along with the important fact that vaccines have never been proven to prevent any disease.\nThe risks that whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus pose to health are low compared to the potential, serious dangers reported as a result of this vaccine. Whooping cough can be treated successfully through a vitamin C protocol developed by Dr. Suzanne Humphries which has been shown to greatly reduce symptoms. [2] \nIn contrast, antibiotic treatments, given routinely by conventional, allopathic physicians to treat whooping cough, have never been shown to positively impact the course of the illness. Regardless of treatment received, most people recover completely from the whooping cough, giving them lifelong immunity to the disease. If they do become re-infected, subsequent courses of the illness are quite mild.\nTetanus can be prevented by thoroughly washing and cleaning the area of infection. [3] The risk of contracting tetanus is quite low. Only 233 cases of tetanus were reported to the Center for Disease Control between 2001 and 2008. [4] The incidence of tetanus declined by more than 95% between 1947 and 2008. [5] \nDiptheria is a very low risk disease, not widely seen in the United States since an outbreak in the 1970\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Between 1980 and 2010, 55 cases of diphtheria were reported to the Center for Disease Control.[6] \nHealth consequences resulting from the Tdap vaccine include encephalitis, brain damage and death. A comprehensive report made by the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) documents clearly the widespread health dangers associated with the Tdap vaccine. [7] Tdap and DTap vaccines are currently used in the United States, replacing the DTP vaccine in 1996, but all three vaccines contain the dangerous pertussis toxin with unsafe additives. [8] \nAs early as 1933, T. Madren reported that two babies died within minutes of vaccination with DPT. A study published in Pediatrics in 1981 revealed that children were experiencing brain damage as a direct result of the DPT vaccines. Research done by the Institute of Medicine in the 1990\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmed that the DPT vaccines were responsible for brain damage. The pertussis toxin, aluminum, mercury and endotoxin contained in the DPT vaccines have been well-documented through scientific studies to cause permanent brain damage. [9] \nA search of the National Vaccine Information Center incidence reports for the DTap vaccine alone on July 21, 2013 showed 52,835 negative reactions were submitted. [10] A 7\/21\/13 review of the reactions to the Tdap vaccine indicated 20,179 negative reactions. [11] \nAs of August 2012, half of the 2,982 awards under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which totaled almost $2.5 billion dollars, were made to those damaged by the Tdap, DTap or DPT vaccines. Currently children in the U.S. routinely receive 6 dosages of the DTap or Tdap vaccine at ages 2, 4, 6 months, 15-18 months, 4-6 years and at age 12. [12] \nIncidence of whooping coughs in vaccinated populations disproves the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153theory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that vaccines prevent disease. Repeatedly, when there is an outbreak of whooping cough, population studies show that the majority of those who contract the illness are vaccinated. No actual research has ever shown that vaccines prevent disease, only that vaccines increase antibodies to a particular disease. [13] \nRenowned neurologist Dr. Russell Blaylock has done extensive research demonstrating that vaccines decrease cellular immunity, which is more important than antibodies in fighting disease. [14] Studies comparing the health of children vaccinated to those unvaccinated consistently demonstrate superior health of unvaccinated children. [15] \nVaccinations inject poisons and toxins into the body, without allowing the body to eliminate the toxins through a cell-mediated immune response, which is critical for the elimination of these toxins. The result is often chronic disease, serious life-threatening reactions or death. The long term health consequences of injecting foreign substances and toxins directly into one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bloodstream are unknown and have never been studied adequately.\nLifelong immunity to disease can only be achieved by natural contracting illnesses, not by immunizations. For most benign childhood illnesses such as chickenpox and whooping cough, natural exposure to a disease can be beneficial to long term health.\nThe cell-mediated reaction that occurs during a natural illness allows removal of the disease organism, along with other waste products in the body through diarrhea, rash, mucus, coughing and fever. Natural illness serves as a clean-up of the body. Many health benefits are claimed, including a stronger immune system, as a result of the body naturally fighting childhood diseases.\nWhile whooping cough is uncomfortable, most individuals will recover from it with no long term consequences and the body will end up being stronger than it was prior to the illness.\nIt is quite typical for mass media to be biased, incomplete, and uninformed when reporting on the subject of vaccinations. Even the editorial section of major newspapers are often one-sided in their reporting, failing to print opposing viewpoints to the widespread vaccination propaganda.\nUnless individuals do their own research, they will be victims of the continued media propaganda and scare tactics used to promote vaccinations. Once toxins are unnaturally injected into the bloodstream, the known and unknown damage cannot be easily undone.\n [contentbox headline=\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdTo Learn More\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type=\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdnormal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd] \nFor more information about the myths surrounding whooping cough, please read this fact sheet from the National Vaccine Information Center.\n [\/contentbox] \n3.

She is a mother who found healing in the realm of alternative medicine for her daughter diagnosed with an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incurable disease.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her two-year search involved tremendous research, experimentation, and consultation with over 12 different holistic practitioners.\nHer daughter became ill after receiving the HPV vaccine series. After tremendous research on the subject of vaccines, she has concluded that vaccines damage health. Michelle is now passionate about alternative health care and the politics which impact it.\nShe is a writer for Naturalnews.com and has completed the first manuscript of a comprehensive book on holistic health.

I can tell you, these numbers are GREATLY under-reported. I can say this for a fact. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just summarize this with a fact that everyone will admit to\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..Fever is listed as an adverse event however parents do not report it because they do not know it is an adverse event but rather believe it is something that just goes with vaccines. A vast majority of children experience fever after vaccines yet their parents do not report it b\/c their physician tells them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they might run a low-grade fever- just give them Ibuprofen or Tylenol\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sooo.. as you can CLEARLY see, the rate of fever following vaccine is massively underreported as is the risk of encephalitis, etc from vaccines. I can also speak to the encephalitis b\/c as a mother of a child who suffered GREATLY from a case of missed encephalitis as an infant and only until she was 18mo old and received her 4th dose did we finally clue in this is what had happened to her. SO, I suggest you do some research and use a bit of critical thinking into the effects of aluminum on the brain which is the culprit of the encephalitis from the DTaP. Aluminum is a known neurotoxin and causes demyelinization of the neural pathways similiar to that which is found in the brains of alzheimers patients as well as is found in the brains of some infants who have died from what their physician has dismissed as a case of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SIDS\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\n                              RoyalinCharge                      \nYes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.I am saying encephalitis is under-reported\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.the numbers would not be as high as the under-reporting of fevers but still highly under-reported. Not all cases of encephalitis require hospitalization\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..our baby screamed and cried from month 2 until month 5.5. We ran her through celiac testing, allergy testing, elimination diet by me (as I breastfed her- Oh and on the front of the breast milk\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.first of all, this is naturally occuring aluminum and at SIGNIFICANTLY low concentration- but most importantly this is how God designed it so the aluminum in breast milk is a non-issue), a pediatric GI doctor, etc etc and nothing was found but no one ever mentioned that the high pitched prolonged screaming that was inconsolible was from the DTaP (read it yourself\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.it is in the Merck manual and on the pamphlet as a contraindication for EVER receiving this vaccine again b\/c it is known as Encephalitis. Furthermore\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6research the absorption percentages on parenteral (oral) versus intramuscular injection then I am pretty sure you will not compare the aluminum in foods to the injected or intravenous aluminum. Pediatric intensivists will tell you that they can only give babies receiving TPN a max. weight dose per day\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the numbers off the top of my head but it is (X)mcg\/kg\/24 hrs\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.because going above this can cause brain damage from the aluminum in the TPN. SOOO\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.yes< i stand FIRM on my aluminum connection and there have been studies showing alzheimers type changes in the brains of mice given aluminum at doses similar to those give to our children as well as DOCUMENTED autistic behaviors in monkeys who received the vaccines as scheduled (the monkeys who did not receive the injections showed no autistic behaviors). And finally\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6i never said that SIDS was alzheimers\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..I said that the aluminum caused changes the brain neural pathways that presented similar to alzheimers-type changes meaning that it caused brain injury. Which could help explain why we have so many children requiring speech and\/or Occupational therapy today (similar to a stroke patient who loses speech or motor function- something caused them to suffer brain injury). Yes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6some cases are attributed to such things as head injury, trauma, lack of oxygen, prenatal complications\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6what have you but I am speaking of those children who were meeting mile stones and then suddenly have loss of speech or function. Just like everything in medicine\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6nothing is 100% (which is why some children tolerate vaccines better than others). We know that not 100% of people can tolerate penicillin so it is ignorant to think 100% of people can tolerate vaccines. Also- another hot topic for me is that rates of asthma are higher in vaccinated versus unvaccinated children. Also\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..there has NEVER been a study on autism rates in vaccinated versus unvaccinated children b\/c the government refuses to do it out of fear of what they will find! I could go on but I am done with this conversation but it was enjoyable! Good day.\n1. Pharmaceutical companies were never said to have paid off public health authorities. What has been done is that they have been brainwashed by the lies and false propaganda we have all been fed for decades, and in fact since the first vaccine was ever made. Once these people, (the ethical and honest ones) learn of how much crap they have been fed as to vaccine safety and effectiveness, it is to late, and their only option is to shut up or quit. None of them want to lose their careers.\n2. I never said one study constitutes 100% proof; what I said was that it was a collection of the cross section of studies, and of course that the CDC refuses to acknowledge. I definitely have a collection of those studies put in front of you, and you can deny that all you want.\n3. I know of all the main line studies that have been done and promoted, claiming that vaccines do not cause ASD, and make denial of any harm at all. I actually have analysis sources for many of those studies of course funded by the CDC and AAP, and they are very well done, right on my website. Those studies are proven junk science and epidemiological study fraud. take a couple full days and actually find out what is on my site. http:\/\/www.vacfacts.info\n4. I have no bias because i have extensively studied the evidence claimed to, on both sides. If vaccines were actually safe and effective, few people would argue with their use. However, the opposite is true, and there are far better ways to protect yourself from pathogens. Thats what you refuse to see, and that is that the foundation of modern medicine have been false all along. But that chemical pharma was the only concept that would create large profits, and never get to real prevention nor healing of anything. Learn of the real history of how that corrupt system of health care came to be. Bechamp had it right, and not Pasteur! You have no clue do you, nor do you care to.\n5. I have several times made analysis of the genetic links so called studies, and they are not only always inconclusive, but only pertain to a small number of cases at best, providing if it actually were correct. All you want to do is desperately blame anything but vaccines. You are in denial. \n","260":"Having their documentary accepted \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and then quickly disinvited \u00e2\u20ac\u201d by the Tribeca Film Festival doubtless was a barely disguised blessing for the makers of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a film that traffics aggressively in widely debunked theories regarding alleged links between the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella) and autism. Without the publicity generated by the Tribeca turnaround, this slickly produced but scientifically dubious hodgepodge of free-floating paranoia, heart-rending imagery \u00e2\u20ac\u201d lots of shots of cute infants who reportedly were damaged by vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and anti-Big Pharma conspiracy mongering likely would have preached to the converted during a handful of theatrical engagements, then slid into the relative obscurity of non-commercial exhibition and home video. Given its now-elevated profile, however, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaxxed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is bound to have at least a slightly longer shelf life, and may even benefit from being attacked by scientists, film critics and other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153establishment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd types.\nCertainly, such attacks will not put off the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target audience of skeptical parents who, for reasons ranging from resentment of government mandates to deeply held religious beliefs, have long attempted to avoid having their children vaccinated for infectious diseases. The anti-vaccination movement has long been depicted as more or less a crusade of the idiot fringe by most mainstream media \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in a memorable 2009 episode of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for example, a crusading D.A. actually pressed charges against the mother of an unvaccinated boy who fatally infected another child \u00e2\u20ac\u201d so this feature-length confirmation of worst fears could be viewed as welcome and overdue counterbalance.\u00c2\u00a0On the other hand: The filmmakers may have inadvertently offered the most damning appraisal of their own project by including a clip of Penn Jillette (of Penn & Teller) dismissing the link between autism and vaccinations: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153F\u00e2\u20ac\u201dk that! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total bulls\u00e2\u20ac\u201dt!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaxxed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is the handiwork of first-time (and, probably, last-time) director Andrew Wakefield, a British gastroenterologist who collaborated on a study linking the MMR vaccine and a reported spike in autism diagnoses that was published in the Lancet, the prestigious English medical journal, in 1998.\u00c2\u00a0A few years later, however, the Lancet withdrew its support of the study \u00e2\u20ac\u201d kinda-sorta like how Tribeca withdrew its support for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaxxed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d after Wakefield was pelted with accusations of fraud, junk science and conflicts of interest. In May 2010, the gastroenterologist was stripped of his medical license.\nNone of that blowback has halted Wakefield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crusade, however, and, not surprisingly, little of it is addressed in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaxxed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The movie devotes a great deal of time to emotionally affecting testimonies from parents who claim their infants were happy and healthy until they began to display symptoms of autism after receiving the MMR vaccine. (One incontestably thought-provoking issue raised by the documentary: Under current U.S. law, pharmaceutical companies are largely shielded from most lawsuits stemming from side effects of vaccines.)\u00c2\u00a0Other lengthy chunks are devoted to questioning the impartiality (and trustworthiness) of the Centers for Disease Control, with suggestions of a dark conspiracy between Big Pharma and the CDC bolstered by secretly recorded conversations between environmental biologist Brian Hooker and CDC \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whistleblower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd William Thompson.\nIn the end, however, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaxxed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd comes across as a grab-bag of charts, theories and anecdotal evidence that would never pass muster by the editors of any major scientific journal (like, say, the Lancet), and too often resembles the kind of one-sided, paranoia-stoking agitprop that political activists construct to sanctify true believers and assault infidels. It should be taken with several grains of industrial-strength salt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d although, to be fair, it does serve as a kind of one-stop-shopping source for anyone seeking to know just what the anti-vaccination crowd is all fired up about.\nThe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153PhD Econometrician\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sure is an active poster!  LOL!  \nHe says not to put words in his mouth, but: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccines are safe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the whole combination question\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6has been answered to death\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all arguments against vaccine safety are\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6utterly unconvincing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are direct quotes from him.\nThese are sweeping generalizations.  But he hilariously tries to position them as scientific findings\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6proven by\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6econometrics!  \nHe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real authoritarian type.  In spite of repeated proven criminal behavior by vaccine manufacturers and the proven phenomenon of regulatory capture, he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they should bear the burden of proving the safety of the steadily increasing number of baby injections they push.  He wants the burden of proof to fall on anyone who dares to question Merck!  And you better \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get into some pretty heavy biochemistry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or you have no right to question any of the products they sell for your baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bloodstream.\nHe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty convinced that all the parents, researchers, and doctors questioning the safety of the full U.S. vaccine schedule are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stupid and uneducated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparently okay with the less-extensive vaccine schedules in all other countries.  Who cares if babies in Europe are deprived of wonderful safe vaccines by their slow-moving governments?  Our authoritarian friend thinks that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s okay.  But if American parents want to move slowly?  That is NOT okay.  Econometrics!\nFor such a smart and educated guy, his grasp of basic logic is a little shaky.  Could there be any danger in giving your baby 49 bloodstream injections, each a cocktail of different ingredients, many of them toxic in larger amounts?  Definitely not, he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasons.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  After all, there are many antigens out there in the world, so why NOT inject more of them into your baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bloodstream?  And a study failed to find a correlation between total number of vaccines and autism spectrum disorder.  Oh, well in THAT case, his hypothesis about the complete safety of the 49 injection schedule has been PROVEN correct.  AH HA HA HA HA!  When it comes to mandating the purchase of Merck products, our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scientist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has a pretty low bar for what constitutes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of safety!  \nI look forward to more of his impressive logic!  He is willing to make an infinite number of posts in this thread if necessary.  Vaccine doubts must be suppressed!  And econometricians are VERY persuasive.  And persistent!\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Frito (and his sock puppets) sure is an active poster! LOL!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I mean look, you can make an infinite number of posts as well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in fact each one of your posts further removes any doubt about your lack of understanding, misleading arguments, and propensity for conspiracy theories.\n* I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say parents and doctors are stupid and uneducated. I said you personally, Frito, are stupid and uneducated. Most normal people can find a middle ground or engage in normal, balance discourse. Not you.\n* Given the amount of misinformation out there and natural fear of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chemicals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and needles around our most precious resource \u00e2\u20ac\u201c children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprising that many parents voice anti-vaccine sentiment. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine, and everyone should educate themselves and participate in the conversation. We should also keep a watchful eye on regulators and big business when it comes to procedures and conflicts of interest. The issue is that they need, at some level, to be able to participate in the discussion when it comes to the scientific studies, and some very basic logic and knowledge of biochemistry and statistics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which can be learned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c goes a long way. Cranks like you making noise don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help. As an analogy, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like you, Frito, are running into the middle of a game of chess yelling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153homerun! Now king me! What, no!? Then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a conspiracy! You chess players don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n* \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Injecting chemicals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd *clutches pearls*  And watch out for that nasty dihydrogen monoxide while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at it. It is used in nuclear power plants as a cooling agent and causes more deaths than anything.\n* I wrote several times about how the scientific method supports or rejects hypotheses and builds up theory over time, and specifically that nobody ever \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a hypothesis. You keep using that word (and building straw men by putting words in my mouth and quote mining) because you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how the scientific method works and, well, because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a crank.\n* I made no comments about vaccine policies \/ schedules in other countries. You said that.\n* You are not in favor of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moving slowly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. You made it abundantly clear that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want any vaccines, period. Stop misrepresenting your position to create fear. This is also extraordinary goalpost moving. I could spend my time to go through all vaccine schedule studies, but then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just come back with some other non sequitur. \nYou want to play with the big boys, but you have neither the education nor the experience to contribute anything useful, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stuck in your little conspiracy-filled world feeling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the expense of everyone else.\nHere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another cute anecdote:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Julie Gerberding was in charge of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 2002 to 2009, which includes the years the FDA approved the Merck Gardasil vaccine. Soon after she took over the CDC, she reportedly completely overhauled the agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s organizational structure, and many of the CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior scientists and leaders either left or announced plans to leave. Some have claimed that almost all of the replacements Julie Gerberding appointed had ties to the vaccine industry.\nGerberding resigned from the CDC on January 20, 2009, and took over as the president of Merck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vaccine division, a 5 billion dollar a year operation, and the supplier of the largest number of vaccines the CDC recommends.\nIt was reported earlier this month that Dr. Gerberding, now the executive vice president of pharmaceutical giant Merck, sold 38,368 of her shares in Merck stock for $2,340,064.32. She still holds 31,985 shares of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock, valued at about $2 million.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nBut don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even worry about the conflicts of interest.  People probably ignore incentives.  They take their cues on how to act from\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6econometrics!\nHere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a cute anecdote:\n Rotavirus vaccine for premature infants, here are Modlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quotes from the official transcript: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153..\n situation where we have to make a judgment in the absence of data, and with a vaccine that\n vote and the recommendation for premature infants passed nine to one \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Modlin voted yes, Dr.\n Glode against. This is a clear example of how the medical bureaucracy (led by the CDC and\n broad sample of racially and genetically diverse infants.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nWow!  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153PhD Econometrician\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd continues to be the hardest working man in show business!\nThis movie review REALLY inspired him!  He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsible for more than 20% of the 126 comments here, and almost 50% of total words written.  \nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really fun to watch him work.  \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Honestly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told us, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I rarely if ever post online.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  Then, after his first 24 or so posts, he hilariously dropped the mic and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m done here.  \u00e2\u20ac\u201d PhD Econ. out \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  Nice flourish.  \nBut, alas, he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after all.  A movie came out about a whistleblower from INSIDE the CDC.  That requires EXTRA \u00e2\u20ac\u0153debunking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd effort from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153econometricians\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like him.\nHe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super fun, and he likes to project his own emotions on others.  He accuses concerned parents of thinking vaccines are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all bad.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  When in fact, HE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S the one who keeps arguing that vaccines are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  \nHe even tells us that the safety of vaccines in combination (49 injections before a baby turns 5 years old) has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153answered to death.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  What an interesting assertion.  The number of baby injections recommended by the CDC has doubled in recent decades.  Where are the hundreds of studies comparing the long-term health impacts of vaccine-free control groups vs. the 49-injection groups?  \nSome of his co-religionists argue that those studies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be performed because it would be unethical to deny any children the life-saving benefits of the 49 injections.  But our PhD friend seems to think these types of studies HAVE been conducted\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdto death.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  I look forward to reading those studies when he provides the citations.  \nIn the meantime, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hoping this PhD posting machine keeps fighting the good fight against Mommies and Daddies thinking for themselves.  Some parents doubt the wisdom of vaccinating infants against sexually transmitted diseases like Hep B.  But he knows better.  Parenting is best left to the econometricians!\n* Good job building a straw man (= overly simplifying and quote mining to build a sham argument). We can add it to your list of logical fallacies. You are the one projecting.\n* I started writing about methodology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c scientific collection, evaluation, and interpretation of data. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand, so your resort to conspiracy theories.\n* Regarding your two comments \/ copy\/paste jobs above, I already threw you a bone below referring to Ben Goldacre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work on poor pharma and regulator practices. However, if you read that book and can avoid quote mining it, you also have to read his other book Bad Science to understand why alternative medicine approaches are much more dangerous and unfounded (hint: he supports vaccine safety and current vaccine schedule since the research is broad, well done, and all points in the direction of no vaccine-autism link). Julie got fired by the new administration and went into industry. Other research papers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any affiliation to the CDC (remember, other countries are not the USA), and if the effect is as big as you claim that vaccines cause autism, it would be impossible to hide in the data from so many research groups.\n* If true re rotavirus, I actually agree with you that regulators should have collected more evidence before making a decision. As a statistician, they generalized to a population outside of previous studies. Part of the discussion may have been consideration of relative risk and understanding the mechanics of how vaccines work, with a commitment to evaluate and monitor safety later on.\n* I answered the question on genetic variation, racial differences etc. below. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand stats.\n* Vaccines, like anything, aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all good. But the risks, complications, and relative risks are well understood. If some infants have skin reactions to needles, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that vaccines cause autism or that we should stop vaccinating. That is your fallacious argument. In an experiment for sleeping pills, something like 5-15% of people reporting side effects from the group receiving sugar pills (marginally smaller than those receiving actual medicine). The placebo effect and confirmation bias are incredible. Which is why we use methods like econometrics. Which you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand.\n* A bunch of anecdotes don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t equal data. \n* Let me give you a reference to hopefully improve your low self-awareness: Why People Believe Weird Things, by Michael Shermer. He gives an excellent example of trying to debate Holocaust deniers. We have a mountain of evidence that the Holocaust occurred, yet they try to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prove\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, following a course of bad arguments like you present (resorting to conspiracy theories, putting, ignoring the mountains of evidence to challenge other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but what about his missing evidence!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as if that invalidates everything else, quote mining, appeal to emotion, moving goalposts, etc.). A strident anti-vaxxer such as yourself is essentially a Holocaust denier. I also invite you to go debate the flat Earthers to experience it for yourself (I assume you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doubt that the Earth is a sphere, but maybe not\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6).\n* Some anti-vaxxers may profit, most don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. But that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t may point. I was just using the same stupid tactics you accuse others of so that you see how it feels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Frito and his sock puppets are anti-vaxx, therefore he must profit from alternative remedies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Irony just goes right over your head when you are busy quote mining and cherry picking.\n* You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really not that self aware. Your responses make you the hardest worker in show business since you have an agenda. And what makes you assume I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a man?\n* And you return again at the end to another conspiracy accusation. I post something refuting your arguments so I must be a paid shill. *Yawn*\n* You are thinking for mommies and daddies. The problem is your thinking is biased, alarmist, and plain wrong. Next you can go debate quantum physicists about their discovery of the higgs boson since you seem to think experience and science don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a hack.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been arguing that, from the point of view of scientific methodology and toxicology, anti-vaxxers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what they are talking about. If you want to know my \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agenda\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, I get sick of hearing anti-vaxxers draw erroneous conclusions or vehement arguments based on anecdotes, conspiracy theories, or plain misunderstanding of basic statistics, causality, and chemistry. Children are harmed with preventable diseases because of this drivel. If there is any real debate about vaccine safety, you are just poisoning the well and drawing attention away from real, valuable research.\n* Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put words into my mouth (= building another straw man argument \u00e2\u20ac\u201c another logical fallacy on your part). All pills are not safe (see my reference below, although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never actually read a book cover to cover). Vaccines are very different from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pills\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since vaccines expose our bodies to the antigens (but not the active disease). Also there are only 5 categories of vaccines that all work pretty much based on the same principles, principles that are well understood and studied.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153No response from you on the wisdom of injecting baby girls AT BIRTH against Hepatitis B, a disease that mostly strikes adult men who have sex with men! LOL.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n* ok, ALL CAPS man, if we really need to head down the rabbit hole (as soon as someone refutes this silly claim, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll move on and come up with another\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 eventually coming back to this stupid point on another thread, ignoring all the other criticisms where you were proven wrong\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6):\n* Around 1\/3 of chronic HepB infections are contracted during childhood. The disease is certainly not only spread via intravenous drug users or gay men, but the transmission of bodily fluids. Does the nurse or babysitter have undiagnosed HepB and forgot to wash her hands after a small cut? Are the toys in the nursery covered in infected baby slobber (HepB virus lives for about a week outside of the body..). Is the mother unknowingly infected and breastfeeding? HepB is highly contagious.\n* We are exposed to hundreds if not thousands of antigens every day. 1 more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a target one from a lethal disease \u00e2\u20ac\u201c makes little difference. And if you think that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd antigen is harmful because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disease, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to admit it is 10x more harmful if you get the real disease which exposes you to about a million times more of the antigen.\n* So what would your proposal be? Vaccinate for HepB after\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 3 months? 5 years? Adults? We know your position is never vaccinate, so why play this stupid game as if you care?\nYou keep harping on about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153combinations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of vaccines. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand the science behind it, period. The chemicals have scary names (watch out for that dihydrogen monoxide in vaccines!). Combinations and vaccine schedule? See my point above about daily antigen exposure, and the paper I cited below \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One et al. (2010). The combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines and the total number of vaccines are not associated with development of autism spectrum disorder\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. See, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153total number of vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \nAnd here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the challenge to you: the burden of proof rests with you. If you think that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153combinations of vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are harmful, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to simply state it, draw the erroneous conclusion that therefore people shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinate, and then run away pointing fingers. Show me (1) a proposed mechanism describing why a combination is harmful (here you need to get into some pretty heavy biochemistry\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) and (2) unbiased data and analysis supporting or refuting your idea (= an econometric analysis). But you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stupid and uneducated.\nAnother post from the PhD econometrician!  Thank goodness!  He will always get the last word\u00e2\u20ac\u201cit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a requirement of his gig.  \nPhD, YOU are the one with an agenda, not me.  You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want any parents to question your sweeping assertions that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccines are safe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all arguments against vaccine safety are\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 utterly unconvincing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that the safety of the U.S. combined vaccination schedule (which has grown dramatically in recent decades and is now up to 49 injections before age 5) has been proven \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to death.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nWhat an impressively \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intellectual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd position.  LOL.  \nAnd, your position neatly lines up with some of the most profitable companies in the world, who have a documented criminal history of research fraud and patient fatalities.  \nBut parents have no right to question the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proven\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd safety of all vaccines in all combinations.  After all, they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153econometricians.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nNo response from you on the wisdom of injecting baby girls AT BIRTH against Hepatitis B, a disease that mostly strikes adult men who have sex with men!  LOL.  \nI assume that you are lobbying your backward nation to hurry up and adopt the more aggressive U.S. vaccine schedule?  After all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proven to death\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to be beneficial and absolutely safe.  Why is your country endangering the population by not quickly mandating these additional vaccines?  \nBut of course you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve elected to give your own kids all the additional vaccines recommended by the more forward-looking American authorities, right? And I certainly hope that YOU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122RE all caught up with the new vaccines that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t around when you were a kid.  \nSock puppet pops up again to defend his alter-ego with the same tedious, faulty arguments\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Yeah I should stop feeding trolls like you but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enlightening to watch you run in circles. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153But but but\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is your never ending cycle of lame points. Someone provides 100 articles, carefully explains them to you, and then you come running back again \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but but but\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, continuously moving the goal posts until we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re back at the starting point.\nI already provided a citation below to a simple paper comparing the dosage schedule, using econometrics, which we use to simulate experimental conditions by exploiting variance in the data \/ natural experiments where it may be unethical or impossible to conduct a controlled trial (which were also conducted prior to vaccine approval by regulators). But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c (1) you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand it anyway, nor do you want to understand it and (2) you said below that you want a world with no vaccines at all (i.e. one with measles outbreaks killing 1\/1000 and causing permanent lifetime damage). You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an arrogant fundamentalist here to poison the well. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like playing chess with a pigeon (hint: you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the pigeon) who knocks over all the pieces, craps on the table, and then flies away claiming victory.\nAccording to your lousy logic, parenting advice is best left to lousy, untrained, inexperienced, biased Internet conspiracy theorists such as yourself. I personally think they are smarter than that, but idiots like yourself making noise (or crapping on the table, as it were) just add to the confusion and fear out there. Keep up the work, our hard-working lunatic friend.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153PhD Econometrician\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is the hardest working man in show biz!  I guess his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m done here\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.PhD Econ out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was a premature mic drop.  He has to keep typing to get the last word\u00e2\u20ac\u201cit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of the gig.  50% of the words in this comments section come from this one guy!  Hilarious.\nAll vaccines in all combinations are safe, he tells us.  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been proven \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to death,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he tells us.  By \u00e2\u20ac\u0153econometric\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd inference because true double blind studies would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unethical.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  \nWho cares about the billions of dollars pharmaceutical companies have had to pay in settlements and criminal fines for kickbacks, poor manufacturing practices, Medicare fraud, false claims, etc.  PhD assures us that the multi-billion dollar vaccine industry is lower margin than the rest of the pharma business, so we should trust these confirmed criminals unconditionally on these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153products.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \nThere are more than 250 new vaccines in the pipeline, so apparently these small(er) margins on huge revenues ARE just a little bit motivating.  The business model of having the government mandate everyone must buy your product is a monopolist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delight.  \nBut it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably thos pesky \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-vaxxers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who are motivated by profits, he suggests.  A few of them have sold over 100 pamphlets!  LOL!\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153All arguments against vaccine safety are\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 utterly unconvincing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he tells us.  Documented cases of vaccine injury can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possibly be real\u00e2\u20ac\u201cbecause econometrics!\nI wonder how our PhD friend justifies the vaccination of NEWBORNS (first 24 hours of life) against the sexually transmitted disease Hepatitis B!  According to the CDC, the biggest risk groups are intravenous drug users and men who have sex with men.  So get your infant daughters vaccinated on Day 1!\nI can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe he trotted out this old gem:  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153See, pharma companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make much on vaccines; they even threatened to simply stop producing them at one point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  Hilarious.  Vaccines may not be quite as lucrative as Viagra, but they are big business.  \nWhat a pity that the PhD econometrician can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t identify himself.  Then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d know he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a shill, but actually just a legitimately \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scientific\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd guy.  But work like his is best done anonymously.  \n* Uh, dip$hit, (1) like almost everyone else on any Internet comments section anywhere you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also posting anonymously and (2) I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather not have loons like you trolling me.\n* Again, you resort to conspiracy theory when someone challenges your faulty conclusions.\n* We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be sure, but homeopathy revenues are also in the billions. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you are a homeopathy shill trying to spread doubt about vaccines!! Admit your REAL motives and give us your name and list of publications! (<\u00e2\u20ac\u201c annoying, isn't it?)\n* Proof exists in the realm of mathematics, but proof is not a word in a scientist's vocabulary. We don't \"prove\" hypotheses; we test hypotheses. Rejecting the null hypothesis means we tentatively accept the alternative hypothesis, subject to revision in case better evidence comes along (using rigorous methodology on unbiased data). It's an important distinction (and very very open minded), but you evidently can't understand it. (Hint: we fail to reject the null hypothesis that vaccines do not cause autism, so we cannot accept the alternative hypothesis that they do cause autism, with like 99.9% certainty at this point).\n* The problem with anti-vaxxers like you is that there is no grey area; vaccines are either \"all good\" or \"all bad\". Naturalistic fallacy, Nirvana fallacy, relative risk incomprehension, etc. I'd be happy to review safety of new vaccines, but the whole combination question and individual reactions have been answered to death.\n* Revenue does not equal margin. Toilet paper is also big business in terms of revenue with razor thin margins, without the risk of being sued by greedy lawyers in a legal system where most judges don't understand science.\n* I already argued below that I think vaccine manufacturers should be liable in the US. But because of your litigious legal system and low margins in vaccines, they figured the risk was too high and threatened to simply exit the market, which could have led to a public health crisis. Consider that the US is a country where some judges and politicians are climate change deniers, McDonald's loses a lawsuit because someone spilled their hot coffee on themselves, etc.\n* Summary: most people on this board with anti-vaccine sentiment are genuinely concerned yet misled due to all the noise out there and lack of knowledge about how science works. You, on the other hand, are simply an idiot peddling conspiracy theories.\nThis is where it starts to get tedious. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then how does that explain the billions\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c> already answered below.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not a scientific forum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Zuto below) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c> but the film being reviewed tackles a scientific question in a very unscientific way, and worse, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s providing misinformation that could lead to death and permanent injuries to children. So no, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a carte blanche to stir up fear in your echo chamber without being challenged.\nMy take home is that arguing with hard-core anti-vaxxers is a futile exercise (and here I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean concerned parents who are simply worried, cautious, and confused thanks to all the misinformation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most people are certainly rationale and reasonable and amenable to logic). \nHere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happens:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Scientist: provides an explanation, counter-argument, or some evidence to the contrary, usually with some nuance.\n -Anti-vaxxer: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yeah, but what about THIS\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (brings a new topic into the discussion without following up to the rest of the discussion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as if \u00e2\u20ac\u0153THIS\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd invalidates the slap down of the anti-vaxxer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous point)\n \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Anti-vaxxer: makes ad hominem attack, assumes the scientist must be either a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sheeple\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, incompetent at research and logic, or paid shill.\nHonestly I rarely if ever post online. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help myself here after reading so many alarmist, misinformed comments. Yeah I wrote a lot because sometimes topics are complicated and require some nuance. Too much to read and consider though just goes right over your head, it seems. Unfortunately I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to resort to truisms, scare quotes, and block letters (i.e. your language).\nI can only hope that some on-the-fence parent read something that made him or her think twice about the bias and rhetoric behind the whole anti-vaxxer movement and this propaganda film Vaxxed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just as concerned about public health and children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well being as anyone.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m done here.\nPeople, this is the intellectual level behind the anti-vaxx movement: Tweedle-dumb Zuto and his ALL CAPS, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scare quotes-loving\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sock puppet (LOL!) give an epic response laden with conspiracy accusations, goal-post moving and stupidity (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153just let everyone get measles and polio\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd).\nNot every country is the US. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t live in the US. I live in a country with a progressive, inclusive health care system where medicine prices are controlled. I get paid for teaching and applying methods to evaluate objectively evidence (i.e. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153finding real answers to legitimate questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not cherry-picking arguments to support my notions, like you).\nSee, pharma companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make much on vaccines; they even threatened to simply stop producing them at one point. Secondly, the fastest way to reduce vaccine revenues is to ensure universal vaccination: companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a dime from smallpox anymore since we eliminated it through vaccine programs. We were almost there with polio \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e. no more polio vaccinations ever again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until conspiracy idiots like you led people to stop vaccinating.\nZuto, the only egoistic shill on here is YOU. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great that is seems gullible people donate to whatever BS blog it is you run, hocking your quackery. You are the one who makes money from spreading anti-vaxx conspiracy theories. Your counter-argument amounts to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stop responding with complicated-sounding science and nuance!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Better simple ideas for simply minds like yours.\nMy statements are hardly alarmist.  How in the world did entire generations of children make it through childhood without vaccinations for childhood illnesses?  They were exposed to diseases and their immune systems cleared things up, for the most part.  Bonus:  it was free and immunity was lifelong.  Industry won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a buck off that, and Econometricians will have to find some other way to make a living.  Now that might alarm YOU, but most people will change the channel to find something more interesting to think about.\nAs I said before, stop regurgitating propaganda and go find real answers to legitimate questions.  Right now you are so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153open\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to letting people express their opinions and air their concerns that you turn right around and bash them over the head with your econometrics and long sentences and statistical mumbo jumbo and I just gotta wonder about your sincerity.  Better yet, you diagram how people think and infer meanings and judge the veracity of other peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statements and make sure everyone is clear on your interpretation.\nYou say THIS is where it begins to get tedious?  Oh, you got tedious dozens of posts ago!\nYou say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Honestly I rarely if ever post online.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  LOL.  Could have fooled me!\nYou say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can only hope that some on-the-fence parent read something that made him or her think twice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bet!  You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve really shown a lot of dedication to your goal!\nYou say people assume that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the scientist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (LOL) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153must be either a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sheeple\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, incompetent at research and logic, or paid shill.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  DING DING DING!

PhD Econ. out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  What?  Why give up now?  Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel embarrassed.  Yes, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a little too obvious in this thread, but surely SOME Mommies and Daddies will still be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153amenable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to your \u00e2\u20ac\u0153logic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  \nAnd they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153amenable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd forever.  Just long enough to get some MANDATORY vaccine laws in place, am I right?  Then we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about what Mommy and Daddy think anymore.  The Econometricians will decide who gets injected with what!  \nYou understand that not all vaccine safety doubts are centered around autism?  Not all vaccine issues center around safety?  Not all vaccine questions are about children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccination?\nYou understand this article was a film review?  This is not a scientific forum.  We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get scored on grammar or spelling or proper citation.  We aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to be denied tenure or a degree for hasty typing.\nYou understand that people who do NOT have a PhD are capable of critical thinking and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a strict set of rules to evaluate a film review or even just the film?  You understand that not everyone is susceptible to emotional appeals, such as some that appeared in the film?  Some people can still think clearly in spite of emotional content.\nDid you even see the film?  It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a wide distribution.  Are you just trying to educate people in case they might believe something that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t approve of?  Why are you so uncomfortable letting people investigate without your help?\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also not okay to end a sentence with a preposition.  So what?  The sentence structure has no bearing on the intended meaning.  Some of the sentences are incomplete and some improperly end with question marks.  That don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make me stoopid.  Catch my drift?\nAnd the pot called the kettle black \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are you the Internet sheriff? You brother are trying to silence and interrupt me.\nIt is indeed a free country and everyone may have an opinion. Equally others are allowed to challenge that opinion in public forums. Some opinions (1) are indeed misinformed or at least severely biased based on well-known human emotional biases and (2) actually hurt or kill people. The misinformed opinion that vaccinations causes autism is one such. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such a loaded topic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c every person alive feels his heart strings tugged when it comes to child safety, so we act against sound scientific evidence out of fear.\nI wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t silence anybody \u00e2\u20ac\u201c instead, I welcome people to air their beliefs so that they can rightly be discussed, corrected (on both sides)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and even duly ridiculed at some point if they keep banging their heads against the same wall and harming others.\nIf your opinion is that the holocaust never happened or aliens abduct people\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 fine, you are welcome to that, although others reserve the right to ridicule you in a public forum. If your opinion is that vaccines cause autism and therefore your innocent child one day dies as a result, now that opinion has real-world consequences and must be addressed. \nIn fact, I stated below that education isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a prerequisite and PhDs are also biased \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like all humans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and not necessarily intelligent. But I also argued that, on average, PhDs have domain-specific knowledge and serious training that allows them to evaluate claims (= hypotheses) in ways that try to remove the biases (e.g. confirmation bias, observational bias, post-hoc bias\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) and get to the truth. I also ultimately trust the process, which in this case has been duly followed. I know humans are biased, but I also understand the methods scientists employ to try to remove that bias, thanks to my training. So no, all opinions are not created equal (see my examples below about mechanics\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6).\nUse of scare quotes and grammar mistakes: check.\nBlind application of a truism (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad science needs to be questioned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd): check.\n * Uh, you think that scientists don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t question everything done in a study? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve participated in hundreds of research seminars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you know, when authors present papers prior to or following publication \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it is a shark tank with blood in the water. Researchers grill the presenters on every aspect of the study looking for holes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how you get good results but also a reputation as a good scientist. Bad science is a stupid statement like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6no measles deaths\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nArrogant statement that somehow you, Zuto, are doing science (while getting paid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) while all the other thousands of scientists aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t: check.\n * by the way, a biology PhD post-doc salary is around $45K per year. Most scientists I know do it because they love it and are curious people, not for the money. Research doctors may get $200K+ per year. The research community spans an entire range of salaries and abilities, so you cannot make the statement that they are all (1) incompetent or (2) paid shills.\nMisleading statement positioned as a fact in order to sow the seeds of doubt: check.\n * there are several problems with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero people have died from measles\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. First, there was a death in 2015, plus several others from complications. Second, the death rate is so low because of widespread vaccination. Third, people may not die from measles, but many suffer permanent complications. Fourth, vaccinations protect against an entire range of illnesses, including killers like polio and smallpox. The measles statement is a non sequitur.\nLook, I admitted below my frustration and that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve rather arrogantly responded to some of the commentators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statements \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just like they can ask questions, I can provide answers. Effective in changing minds? Likely not for everyone. Are my points valid? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to think so.\nYou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just done what every anti-vaxxer does: moved the goal posts (you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t address and actual points I made below, but rather put in new non-sequiturs and levied an ad hominem attack). You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried to seed doubt. Doubt, no matter how misled or insignificant, leads to fear. Honest, well-meaning parents act on that fear and avoid vaccinating their children, which leads to real children dying.\nI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doubt your motivations or convictions. What I challenge is the biased road you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve travelled to reach those conclusions.\nPeople are not naturally good at objectively understanding things like causality and relative risk,and we (i.e. human beings) are emotional, bias machines. Hence formal training or application of scientific methods are required. And looking at the good science done, the weight of evidence is overpoweringly in favor of vaccine safety. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my point.\n(1) Thanks for the ad hominem, Jo Linda. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried to keep my comments factual and on topic. A few commentators have responded with challenging, intelligent questions or responses, to which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve added my two cents. Unfortunately however science isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a matter of opinion, and your opinion is not as valid compared to, say, a medical research doctor or epidemiologist. I readily admit that my opinion about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong with my car isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as valid as a professional mechanic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and my opinion about string theory doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean anything compared to that of a group of theoretical physicists. And in this case, your opinion matters because unvaccinated children have literally died from preventable diseases. Grow up. Sure, science has it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share of cranks, like Wakefield, but luckily enough curious, genuine researchers have investigated the topic to give me a very high level of confidence that vaccines (and current vaccine schedules) are completely safe. (Likewise, my research and industry experience leads me to believe that there is no cover-up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it would just be untenable at that scale).\n(2) I admit my user name is cheeky and comes across as arrogant. As I said below, I am frustrated by comments such as yours, so I tried to establish a bit of authority. Having worked with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153PhDs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it necessarily shows intelligence, and they are often as stubborn as anyone on certain topics (and I know many who are simply idiots in their personal lives or believe all kinds of whacky things outside of their field). But I do think it shows serious expertise and training in a particular area. Mine happens to be in research design and evaluation of non-experimental data. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing yours isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. And no, reading some blogs or watching a documentary doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t replace 10+ years of training.\nI also said I would gladly change my mind\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 if reliable, good evidence showing some link existed.\n(3)  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve addressed your opinion already below about the lack of evidence supporting (and common human biases leading to) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there are some kids who have some kind of reaction to having a number of vaccines at one time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. If you understood how the research design works used in the studies and the biology behind vaccines, I can image you would change your mind.\nLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say you are the parent of a healthy child who changes dramatically after being administered vaccines. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not allowed to wonder, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gee, might those vaccines have something to do with this?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -is this what your contention is here? Just piss-poor journalism.\nFair point, but I still think his statement is true. You have to realize how frustrating the whole ant-vaxx movement is for trained scientists. If I can make an analogy, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like if you are the only person in the room who can read Spanish, yet everyone else is telling you that everything you are reading off a black and white page is wrong or in fact the opposite of what you say.  You bring out a dictionary. They still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe you. You bring in a native Spanish speaker, and they say your translation must be fraudulent because you are conspiring over some secret agenda  >:s  Only worse, if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heed the translation, children could very well die. No matter what anybody says, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never change your mind.\nHonestly, as a small example of the problem, there are commentators here who take a staunch anti-vaxx standpoint \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who are dead certain they are right that vaccines are harmful \u00e2\u20ac\u201d yet have the gall to question \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what is econometrics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The *slap* sound is my hand hitting my forehead. A few went to their alma matter, the University of Google, to find definitions and tell me that my opinion is irrelevant. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like vehemently arguing with your mechanic about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong with the car and then asking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but what are spark plugs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (epidemiology uses econometric techniques heavily, although most people call it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stats\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a matter of terminology, not method).\nI think you have the right intentions, but you need to honestly question your own layman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to understand and review scientific research. I, like you, started looking into this because I am genuinely concerned with public health and the well-being of my family. However, I, unlike you, am very well trained and experienced in the scientific method, both in conducting lab research and doing statistical analysis of results. Unless you have a lot of experience and training in the matter, you can easily mislead yourself down a rabbit hole chasing some nugget that you think proves your biased suspicion. \nYou must know of confirmation bias and the post-hoc fallacy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not allowed to wonder, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gee, might those vaccines have something to do with this?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can wonder, sure. But then we test it using unbiased methods. And no, there is no link between vaccines and autism.\nFrankly, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit arrogant to call yourself a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153truth seeker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, implying the rest of us are brainwashed or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care? The ultimate truth seeker is a scientist, someone who gets in a lab or get her hands dirty with raw data. Science has mechanisms built in to avoid, over time, the biases of trying to find the result you are hoping for (which is essentially what anti-vaxxers are guilty of). Reading blogs, assuming there must be massive prolonged conspiracies, and misunderstanding scientific papers is the antithesis of objective truth seeking. Your \u00e2\u20ac\u0153truth seeking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t censored; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called out for being the harmful, paranoid nonsense that it is. Why the heck would someone spend 10+ years in university to learn this stuff if anyone could just do it by intuition or from Google University??\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry it seems that you have suffered some hardship due to an autistic grandson. \nTo answer your two questions:\n(1a) The rate of autism indeed seems to be increasing. However, most doctors agree that it is due to improved diagnoses and a broader definition of ASD (that often fits into language supported by health insurance policies\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). If the actual rate is increasing, then we need to find out what is causing it. The anti-vaxxers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continuous focus on the now debunked vaccine-autism link takes away valuable research dollars and attention from investigating other possible causes of autism. Stop beating a dead horse.\n(1b) Post-hoc fallacy. People in the middle ages thought that bleeding people with leaches healed them. They observed that, often after bleeding a patient, the patient got better. If they had done big statistical analyses (and used their brains\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6), it would have been evident that, well, people often get better with or without leaches. Likewise they believed that stepping on a spider causes it to rain. Likewise, children start showing signs of autism around the time they get vaccinated. This is a large part of the problem: emotions and the post-hoc fallacy obviously drive our beliefs in powerful ways. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to get sucked into this bizarre conspiracy theory when we all desperately want answers to something painful like seeing a child develop differently.\n(2) Am I convinced that the CDC was hiding research results? Unlikely. What is more likely is that the researcher did a crappy analysis and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand where he went wrong, it was corrected, and then he took his conspiracy theory to anyone who would listen. I wrote on this below regarding the creationist researcher who re-analyzed the data incorrectly (which, by the way, would have shown African American children at risk, but not other races, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re white, then sorry, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it both ways to pick and choose your evidence). I would even say this: supposing the study \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which was a small sample \u00e2\u20ac\u201d did find a weak link. Now what!? Well, if you do enough studies on small samples, eventually just by chance a significant result might pop up (small samples mean the two groups might not be truly randomized), and this is something we could easily discount using e.g. replication and meta analyses from all the other studies.\nRegarding congressional inquiries, these can be useful, like the famous case of watching the tobacco executives get grilled (which was based on experimental and econometric evidence), but congressmen are not scientists. My God, last year a congressman walked into congress holding a frozen snowball trying to tell a bunch of climate scientists that he had just disproven global warming. The level of stupidity burns. You might end up with a circus of some uneducated congressmen throwing idiocy at unprepared, introverted scientists. It might prove nothing.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to think the main difference between scientists and laymen is that scientists, when confronted by good, factual evidence, will be forced eventually to change their minds; they are forced to because of their understanding of how science tries to remove observational and emotional bias. Laymen do the opposite: they hold onto their beliefs no matter what and search out slivers of biased evidence (confirmation bias) to think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve proven their point. I would gladly change my stance on vaccine safety \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my own kids would be at risk after all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the evidence just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there, and I have enough experience with funding bodies, scientists (who are also caring people and not paid corporate shills), and research methods to conclude vaccines are safe and do not cause autism (the alternative \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seeing a child die, lose hearing, or become crippled and infertile because of something like measles or mumps is 1000x worse).\nBy the way, someone did a (still unpublished, but entertaining) study and found a strong correlation between science denialism and using ALL CAPS. It is the equivalent of YELLING at someone. I can read and understand your point, so YOU don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to yell.\nThe documentary reveals the authors of one of the major studies that refutes an autism link\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6actually DID show a link. It says in the movie this whistleblower, Dr. Thompson Sr Scientist at the CDC was a co-author on a 2004 study that the CDC published as having no link to autism\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but he admits now that it did and they threw out those documents in a garbage can\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6all of them together, literally just threw them out. No wonder he has a lawyer now. What could he possibly stand to gain by admitting such a thing? \nAnother senior scientist employed by the CDC to conduct autism and MMR link studies is on the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most wanted list Dr. Paul Thorson\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the very funds he was given to do TWO such study BY THE CDC  went missing and he is up on charges of fraud and money laundering? Meanwhile both those studies still stand as *fact* and are considered the strongest cases against a link\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6while a portion of the money was never used to carry them out properly!\nI think you make a fair point. Still, see my comments below which amount to \n(1) the CDC isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only organization doing vaccine safety research. In fact, most of the hundreds of papers come out of academia or institutes from foreign countries (the US-based CDC does not control every researcher around the world\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). And this mountain of research shows the same thing: no vaccine-autism link. There is a breadth of techniques, data sources and samples used. Thus I find the focused wrath of anti-vaxxers on the CDC a bit odd.\n(2) I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had my econometric work reviewed and reviewed others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work, ditto for my lab work. Studies go through a battery of peer reviews, presentations etc. where many people criticise and look for methodological errors. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen where a non-statistician on an article couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grasp why his results weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t significant (his team had used the wrong model given the distribution of the data, so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show anything). Given all the other evidence, it is conceivable that this guy from the CDC made a mistake but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why. Also as I noted below, researchers are people too and have their fair share of kooks and biased opinions.\nAnd the problem with the film is that it really pulls at our mammalian heart strings, thereby reducing our ability to objectively review evidence. The heartbreak in these families is difficult to watch, and that knee-jerk reaction where we look for justice, causality and accountability overrides our brains. I mean, just because my grandmother killed a spider yesterday and it rained today doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that killing spiders causes rain\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 even though she seems to earnestly believe so. I think this is the most difficult concept to grasp\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 even researchers fall prey to this, which is why science provides techniques to objectively remove bias. \nTherefore, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the film provides a helpful contribution and will only reinforce people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biases and lack of science literacy.\nEconometric tools and design are used heavily in epidemiology for hypothesis testing, especially where it may be unethical, unfeasible, or too expensive\/complicated to conduct large RCTs (randomized controlled trials).\nAn example of a real-life application of econometrics would be to test the hypothesis that as a person is vaccinated, the likelihood of developing a disease like autism also increases.\nIn an RCT, the groups are the same on average and the treatment is exogenous (imposed from outside the system), leaving one possible factor for any difference in outcomes: the treatment. This is why new drugs generally need large, expensive RCTs (with placebos in the control group so that really everything is the same) to show safety and efficacy.\nIf the treatment-control groups aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t randomized, one cannot simply compare \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vs. untreated groups; the groups self-select, meaning they are no longer equal, meaning you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pinpoint what causes what. This is how tobacco companies were able to hide any connection between smoking and illness for so long. Econometrics controls for differences between the groups to take them out, essentially synthesizing experimental conditions. And now we have better techniques and super computers to do the calculations, which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have in the 70s and even 80s.\nGenerally econometrics is considered a sister yet separate field from statistics \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it tries to get at causality, and the mathematical underpinnings are different. Econometrics also includes methodological design considerations.\nFor example, One et al. (2010). Vaccine. Volume 30, Issue 28, 13 June 2012:  they used case-control, but also conditional multiple regression model; this is a simple econometric technique.\nIn a field like epidemiology there is necessarily a division of labor: medical doctors, econometricians\/statisticians, and biochemists. But math is hard, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen many doctors who have difficulty grasping why their personal observations may not be generalizable without proper techniques. \nThe infamous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153CDC whistleblower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd paper is one such case: the original study used correct econometrics, the second study (which erroneously found that blacks were more likely to get autism after vaccination) made grievous and likely intentional mistakes in the stats, essentially stratifying the samples into tiny groups until the researcher found the result he was hoping for (and funnily enough white people still point to the study as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when the faulty stats showed white kids weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at risk\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6).\nEconometricians are experts at eliminating bias from studies. This is why I shake my head and lose my mind at all these anti-vaxxers: they are so certain that they are right, yet they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the faintest clue about the powerful logic behind these studies showing how safe vaccines are.\nYou just need to read the vaccine insert created by the manufacturers to realize that your child has been injured by the vaccine, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why they talk about studies that are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scientific proof of vaccine safety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when the own manufactures have inserts that explain that those vaccines can cause severe allergic reactions, demyelination of nerves, sizures, neurological disorders and even death and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program that only pays a maximum of $250k for vaccine injuries including death, has already paid more than 3 billion, even after rejecting most of the cases, not paying the full amount most of the times and waiting even more than 10 years to pay in some cases. It is so obvious that vaccines damage human beings at all levels and that some of them are damaged to the point that it is so evident that no one can deny it, that only ignorance can make people blind about this subject\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but ignorance is weapon that those who are in control can use all the time and here is humanity, not doing their job, not getting informed, leaving in the darkness and believing everything that corporate controlled media says about everything. But some people is waking up and hopefully more will wake up in the near future\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..\nJust so you are aware, drug companies essentially error on the side of caution (or rather are forced to since this is generally regulated by governments) and report any and all side effects that may have been reported during a trial or study, even if these are merely coincidental, due to placebo effect, or have no statistical significance (i.e. the side effects were reported in both treatment and control groups \u00e2\u20ac\u201c biology is complex and *%&* goes wrong all the time in the body due to many, many random factors). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meant to draw attention to the need for further investigation in case many doctors or patients also observe such side effects.\nAlso: relative risk. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather take the 1 \/ 1 million chance that I get some adverse reaction to a vaccine than the 1 \/ 10\u00e2\u20ac\u2122000 chance that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m maimed or die from something like polio or measles during a lifetime. The reported adverse effects from a vaccine approach the rate in the population of misdiagnosed immunocompromised people and statistical limits (meaning that for all intents and purposes the data shows that vaccines are safe beyond a reasonable doubt). Sorry, but the world is dangerous with all sorts of crappy diseases that we, the human race, collectively try our best to get rid of.\nAlso, frankly a lot of the research in immunology and vaccine safety takes place not in the pharma companies, but in universities and public research institutes all over the world (i.e. not related to the US government in any way). The point I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made in other comments is that the scale of the conspiracy would be impossibly immense, and that each and every researcher in all these thousands of labs would need to be some kind of heartless psychopath to cover up such important data on pubic safety. The whole reason we use statistical and scientific methods is to overcome the inherent bias to which emotional human beings are susceptible. You are essentially ignorant to epidemiology and immunology since one can only assume you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually worked as a scientist, and no, google research doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count.\n","261":"There are nine confirmed cases of measles among people who visited Disneyland during the week before Christmas, according to this report from KTTV in Los Angeles.\nLet the hysteria begin! Or not.\nBefore everyone starts panicking and racing out to get vaccinated. Please take some time to learn the truth about measles, and about the MMR vaccine.\nNearly three years ago there was another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big scare\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when two cases of measles were tied to people who visited the Super Bowl Village in Indianapolis. That \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outbreak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd resulted in near-hysteria in three states and a huge media campaign to blame parents of children who had not received the MMR vaccine. Did you hear about it? Yeah. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long. And guess what? Nobody died.\nI wrote about it at the time, and since I collected a lot of information then, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to reinvent the wheel for this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outbreak.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHere is the article from USA Today, which was written about the Indiana outbreak. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there will be similar articles regarding the Disneyland \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outbreak.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nDr. Christenson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements are likely to be repeated by other doctors and by Public Health officials in California, so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s examine what Dr. Christenson says.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Measles can be a fatal disease.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0 This is true.\u00c2\u00a0 It is more likely to be fatal if you happen to live in a third-world country than if you live in the United States.\nThe CDC has this to say about the severe complications from measles:\nThe statement that 1 out of 1,000 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153children\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who get measles will die from it is misleading. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because those numbers are based on the global measles problem; not measles in the United States.\nWhen I wrote the article on the Indiana \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outbreak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 2012, there was a CDC MMWR publication I used and linked to, to show how inflated the 1\/1000 number was. That publication has either been moved or taken down. I will try to find it and include it here, but for now I have to leave this information without the citation (due to limited time). In the CDC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MMWR report on measles, it stated there are approximately 20 Million cases of measles each year worldwide and of those cases, there are approximately 197,000 deaths. This appears to be where they are getting their figure of 1 or 2 deaths per 1,000 cases.\u00c2\u00a0 The MMWR report also stated that about 1\/2 of the deaths from measles occur in India. \u00c2\u00a0So if half of the roughly 200,000 deaths from measles occurs in India, then the rest of the world splits the remaining 100,000 deaths per year. That still sounds like a lot. And SOME of them were children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not all. So the 1 in 1,000 deaths among children statement just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense, unless you are talking about children in third-world countries.\nMy friend Dawn wrote a great article\u00c2\u00a0called Putting Measles Into Perspective, which was published here on VaxTruth. In her article, Dawn points out that prior to the availability of the measles vaccine, which was licensed in 1963, the number of yearly measles deaths in the U.S. was approximately 450.\nHere is a photo Dawn used in her article, to demonstrate a more likely estimate of the risk of U.S. citizens dying from measles:\n.000237%\u00c2\u00a0is a very small number.\u00c2\u00a0 What this means is that prior to the\u00c2\u00a0availability of the\u00c2\u00a0measles vaccine in the U.S.,\u00c2\u00a0between 2 and 3 people out of every ONE MILLION U.S. citizens died from measles complications.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Are you feeling a little better now about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outbreak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of measles at Disneyland?\u00c2\u00a0 I hope so.\nDr. Christenson states:\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Measles is also preventable.\u00c2\u00a0 Parents should take this opportunity to make sure their children are up to date on their shots.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe implication of Dr. Christenson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement is that vaccines will prevent your child from getting measles.\u00c2\u00a0 Is this true?\nHere are a few studies that do not support Dr. Christenson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The phenomenon of declining vaccine efficacy may have become more pronounced in recent years because there has been less exposure to measles infection; we have found that exposure to natural measles is important in maintaining protective antibody levels among vaccinated children.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0 (citation)\nClin.

Can J Public Health. 1991 May-Jun;82(3):189-90. French. PMID: 1884314; UI: 91356447. The 1989 measles outbreak in the province of Quebec has been largely attributed to an incomplete vaccination coverage. In the Quebec City area (pop. 600,000) 1,363 confirmed cases of measles did occur. A case-control study conducted to evaluate risk factors for measles allowed us to estimate vaccination coverage. It was measured in classes where cases did occur during the outbreak. This population included 8,931 students aged 5 to 19 years old. The 563 cases and a random sample of two controls per case selected in the case\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s class were kept for analysis. The vaccination coverage among cases was at least 84.5%. Vaccination coverage for the total population was 99.0%. Incomplete vaccination coverage is not a valid explanation for the Quebec City measles outbreak. (citation)\nDavis RM, et al.(1987) A persistent outbreak of measles despite appropriate prevention and control measures. Am J Epidemiol. 1987 Sep;126(3):438-49. PMID: 3618578; UI: 87295970. From January 4 to May 13, 1985, an outbreak of 137 cases of measles occurred in Montana and persisted for 12 generations of spread. A total of 114 cases occurred on the Blackfeet Indian reservation in northwest Montana. Of the 137 cases, 82 (59.9%) were in school-aged children (aged 5-19 years). Of the 114 cases on the reservation, 108 (94.7%) were classified as programmatically nonpreventable. A total of 64 (82.1%) of the 78 patients on the reservation who were born after 1956 and were above the recommended age at vaccination had a history of adequate measles vaccination. Additionally, an audit of immunization records at the schools in Browning, Montana, where most of the cases occurred, showed that 98.7% of students were appropriately vaccinated. A retrospective cohort study in the Browning schools failed to identify age at vaccination or time since vaccination as significant risk factors for vaccine failure. Overall vaccine efficacy was 96.9% (95% confidence interval =89.5-98.2%). None of 80 Browning students who were vaccinated at less than 12 months of age and revaccinated at 15 months of age or older became infected. A case-control study showed a significant association between attendance at Browning basketball games and infection early in the outbreak. This outbreak suggests that measles transmission may persist in some settings despite appropriate implementation of the current measles elimination strategy. (citation)\nBarratta et al. (1970) investigated an outbreak of measles in Florida from Dec 1968-1969 and found there was little difference in the incidence of measles in vaccinated and unvaccinated children.

Serum samples from 1806 students at two secondary schools were obtained eight days after the onset of the first case. Only 4.1 percent of these students (74 of 1806) lacked detectable antibody to measles according to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and more than 99 percent had records of vaccination with live measles vaccine. Stratified analysis showed that the number of doses of vaccine received was the most important predictor of antibody response. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals of seronegative rates were 0 to 3.3 percent for students who had received two prior doses of vaccine, as compared with 3.6 to 6.8 percent for students who had received only a single dose. After the survey, none of the 1732 seropositive students contracted measles. Fourteen of 74 seronegative students, all of whom had been vaccinated, contracted measles. In addition, three seronegative students seroconverted without experiencing any symptoms. We conclude that outbreaks of measles can occur in secondary schools, even when more than 99 percent of the students have been vaccinated and more than 95 percent are immune.

It has. In at least 28 studies in multiple different countries. \u00c2\u00a0I know his observations have been replicated because even those who are trying to refute his findings have replicated them.\u00c2\u00a0 See my article, Only 5 of 25 if you doubt the veracity of this statement.\nHere are a few other studies that have reported an association between autism and MMR vaccine:\nRegardless of what you believe about the MMR\/Autism debate, Dr. Christenson has stated (as others no doubt will also state) that there is no evidence of other chronic adverse conditions.\u00c2\u00a0 Is THIS part of his statement true?\nHere are a few articles from the peer-reviewed medical literature, documenting some of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other chronic adverse conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from MMR vaccination:\n\u00c2\u00a0Neurological disorders:\nThank-you to Think-Twice, Global Vaccine Institute for compiling much of the information above.\nOf course, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to weed through all of the above studies to find out if the MMR vaccine can cause long-term, serious, chronic conditions, you could just ask the mother of this child:\nFinal word:\nThe last part of of the statement that needs to be addressed does not appear to be from Dr. Christenson; rather, it appears to come from the author of the USA Today article.\u00c2\u00a0 It is\u00c2\u00a0the assertion that MMR Vaccine is\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153usually needed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00c2\u00a0for school attendance.\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 unless you happen to live in West Virginia or Mississippi.\nTo find out about vaccine exemptions in your state, please click this link.\nI have been accused of censorship because I did not publish all of the comments from Adam McLean.

However, as I explained to Adam, I am just one person and I do not have time to respond to all of his comments, and I do not feel comfortable leaving them unaddressed. So I am going to respond here to his most recent comment. I have also done so under Dawn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s article.\nFor reference:  This is the one comment (out of eleven) from Adam that I did publish. The others were similar.\nAdam McLean January 11, 2015 at 6:44 am (Edit)\nGood grief; listen to your doctor. Listen to the tens of thousands of medical researchers, and millions of doctors around the world that dedicate their lives trying to save other lives, and fully support vaccination. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t become a story like these:\nand many, many more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all completely preventable with the measles vaccine.\nNow, to Adam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent protest, and my responses [in brackets]:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Marcella: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very confused. If you read my comments before deleting them, you know just as well as I do that not one of them contained a single link to Paul Offit or CHOP. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if you still have access to the text, but I do have copies of each that I could repost if you are willing to allow that.\n[My response: Please refer to Adam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment above and to the links he provided, the first of which is to CHOP.]\nBack to Adam:\nHere is a brief summary of each post that I made, first to this article \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPutting Measles into Perspective\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (5 posts):\n-I posted a message pointing out the main severe complication of measles is pneumonia, which is why people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t often think of measles itself being fatal\n-I posted that measles can be particular bad for pregnant women due to complications involving premature labor, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and low-birthweight infants\n [Which is why it is much more preferable for children to get measles naturally, as most did in early childhood prior to the mass vaccination program. This gave them long-lasting immunity, possibly life-long, and protected women throughout their pregnancies and also provided immunity to offspring during the first year of life. The vaccine often fails, with primary vaccine failure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c giving no protection, and secondary vaccine failure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c waning immunity after 5-25 years, leaving women with a false sense of security and zero protection when they need it most.]\n-I posted the list of links to stories of people whose lives were affected (and sometimes ended) by measles, which you did post\nThe remainder of my comments were posted to your article \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMeasles at DIsneyland!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (5 posts):\n -I pointed out that from 2000-2010, there were 8 deaths from measles in the US out of 777 cases, so an average risk of about 1 in 100 for those that actually catch measles.\n [What you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say is that at least some of those cases of measles are the result of the vaccine (vaccine-strain measles has been identified in several cases and horizontal transmission (aka \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shedding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) does occur, particularly among people who are immune compromised, which may be why the death rate would be higher. The increase in measles cases over the last several years was predicted by scientists at the time of the development and mass use of the vaccine, due to concerns about both primary and secondary vaccine-failure. What we are seeing can be expected to continue and increase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not due to unvaccinated children, but as a result of the vaccine program.]\n-Another comment asked to compare the risk of being struck by lightning and dying in a car accident to that of dying from measles; I posted the figures and references for each.\n [I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to respond to that because it seems irrelevant.]\n-I made a post arguing that the risk of dying once someone actually caught measles (1 in 100 based on recent data) was a much more significant figure than the figure you calculate in your article, i.e., the risk of death from measles for any US citizen.\n-I posted that the risk of death of 1 in 1000 prior to the vaccine in 1963 was accurate based on reported cases, but that the common assumption was that many cases were not reported prior to the vaccine being available.\n [With 3-4 million cases of measles per year (U.S.) and an average death rate of 450 per year in the U.S., the 1\/1000 figure is complete bullshit. Again, using third-world stats to fear-monger does not deserve a response.]\n-I posted that while measles-related deaths in the US were going away prior to the vaccine (primarily due to improved treatment of pneumonia), measles cases were not decreasing until the vaccine was introduced in 1963 (and the number of cases dropped by 20X, and deaths by a further 10X). These data were omitted from Figure 1 in the article.\n [There is no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Figure 1\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3 in the article. If you are referring to Dawn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s article, that is something you should take up with her. As I told you and as is clearly stated, she does not write for VaxTruth and her article was reposted here with permission. If you contact her and receive a response, I would be happy to post that in the comments on this site.\n My own response to your comment is, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why are we trying to prevent measles in the first place, since it is not a serious infection in children (when it occurs naturally and for a very important reason)? As my more recent article \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Measles is GOOD for YOU? conveys, the attempt at wiping out measles and other mild childhood infections was misguided and it now appears that the artificial manipulation and tamping down of the natural immune system, may be a contributing factor to the higher incidences of childhood cancers. Given that measles (and mumps) infections are protective against cancer, and given that the MMR vaccine has been shown to alter DNA in recipients via homologous recombinant DNA from aborted fetal cell lines, and given that childhood cancers are associated with alterations in DNA in early childhood, why would we want to continue this insane practice?]\nI reiterate, none of these posts included any link or mention of Paul Offit or CHOP in any way.\nI would just like to share this video that I found on the Daily Paul website, (which is Ron Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website for those who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know)  : )   All this fear and propaganda regarding measles is driving me insane!\n First, a little background on why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m even here. We have 3 children, the first being fully vaccinated, the second we stopped at 4 months, the third has zero vaccinations. What is strange in our case, is that our first born (the fully vaccinated one), is sick ALL the time with so many allergies, to so many things, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve  lost count. We actually took her to an allergist and he showed us her chart from the test results and everything lit up like a Christmas tree, meaning, she is supposedly allergic to EVERYTHING. We said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well Doc, does that mean she needs to be in a plastic bubble her whole life?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, but she still has to avoid certain foods.\n  Our second, is the second most sick in the family, with frequent illnesses (not any many as the first born), but, none the less, she is sick quite frequently.\n The strangest thing of all is found in our third born, his immune system is SO strong, he hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even had a bout with flu and he is 9 years old! He gets the occasional sniffles, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about it! Actually, one time when we were camping in Yosemite he kept drinking the creek water (even though we told him not to, of course) and he wound up with diarrhea and vomiting for one night, but he was completely better by the time the sun came up and was running around in no time.\n Our oldest is fully vaccinated because I was a young mother and was petrified by her pediatrician and his scare tactics. She had a SEVERE allergic reaction to her 4 month vaccines and we had to rush her to the E.R because her legs swelled to triple their size, she had a temperature of 103, she had SEVERE labored breathing, she  wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nurse or take water; it was THE SCARIEST time in our lives!!! Even when I recount it today, I still cant help but cry and shake; we thought FOR SURE we would lose her. We still listened to our Dr. because he said that happens in rare cases, but that we should continue to vaccinate because the disease is FAR worse than the reaction. So, scared once again, we continued to vaccinate. We had NO clue there was an Adverse Reaction Dept. set up for vaccines, our Dr. didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t report it or inform us of such a dept.\n When our second child was born we still had no clue and we listened to our Dr.,  and once again, at that 4 month visit, within 30 minutes, we knew something was terribly wrong once again, and  we were back in the E.R because of the exact same reaction as the first born. It was then that  I started doing my homework, and found alternative research that backs what I had been feeling all along; children CAN get life threatening reactions to vaccines. To date, I am very upset that there are no safety studies for children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 immunizations, e.g., if a child may have a potential life threaten allergy to certain vaccines, etc.\n Anyway, this video below shows how America USED to react to childhood measles BEFORE the advent of the measles vaccine:\n","262":"In recent months, there have been a number of articles in Maine newspapers about confirmed cases of rabies in wildlife. People often forget that wildlife, while cute, beautiful, or exotic, can be dangerous. Game wardens and rangers tell us never to approach wildlife, especially those who appear to be acting strangely. Most wildlife will go to great lengths to avoid contact with humans so any attempt of a wild animal to come closer should be avoided.\nRabies is a fatal virus and a public health problem. All mammals are believed to be susceptible to the disease. Usually, it is transmitted from animal to animal through bites. The incubation period varies widely; in domestic animals, it is usually 3-12 weeks but can range from several days to months, rarely exceeding 6 months. Signs of rabies include inappetance, difficulty swallowing, abnormal behavior, loss of coordination, paralysis and seizures. Death follows quickly. Currently, there are no known effective rabies antiviral drugs.\nMany of us got our first lesson on rabies from the movie \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Old Yeller\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It was an emotionally graphic, wrenching story of a dog that contracts rabies on a Texas ranch protecting his homesteading family from a rabid wolf. While I will maintain forever that a well-told story conveys a message faster than any textbook, it is vital to back fiction with fact.\nOne of the best sites for accurate, clinical information is the Centers for Disease Control website: http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/rabies\/ This site contains up-to-date information for both human and animal care.\nAs a veterinary office, we cannot diagnose human maladies or possible symptoms of any type; however, when there is a public risk for disease that can be transmitted through animals, we always advise people to contact their human healthcare provider for advice. And in the case of rabies, we encourage people to visit the CDC website.\nAlso, a human emergency department is familiar with rabies exposure protocols and is another valuable source of information. (If you are interested in case studies:http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/rabies\/location\/usa\/surveillance\/human_rabies.html )\nWe can discuss rabies and your pets. The greatest risk for exposure we have found is via the aforementioned wildlife: raccoons, foxes, woodchucks, skunks and bats. These are the most common, but other mammals are not immune.Healthy wildlife will not look to encounter you or your animals except when looking for food; and even then, they will not approach you.\nThe first rabies vaccine for any dog lasts for 1 year; subsequent inoculations have a 3-year duration. Cats have a slightly different protocol: it is a yearly injection since the safest vaccine (for the cat) has a shorter life once injected. Many people feel that if their cats are indoor only, rabies vaccines are not warranted.\nThe state of Maine feels differently (it is state law to vaccinate against rabies) and so do we: every year, we have clients call to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My cat caught a bat last night!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But because the cat was not up to date with her rabies vaccines, she will need to be quarantined in order to protect the humans in the household; if she was vaccinated within the last year, she would only need a booster.\nLikewise, if your dog comes into contact with a raccoon or a stray dog who gets away from the encounter and his rabies vaccine has just expired, animal control must be contacted and quarantine enforced. Most times, it is a matter of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153house arrest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whereby your dog cannot have contact with anyone outside the immediate family. But that also means no play dates, no long walks, no fun. While it is sometimes hard to find the time to get to the vet before rabies vaccines expire, it is well worth your while to make the time. We send out reminders a few weeks in advance of the due date so that we can coordinate scheduling.\nAbout 3 years ago, Maine law began requiring veterinarians to submit a monthly report of all canine rabies inoculations administered. In turn, the state then disperses that information to the towns in order for them to keep track of dogs in their jurisdictions. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a few clients call believing that we purposely reported them to their towns for not registering their dogs.\nWe explain that the Department of Agriculture chose this way to help towns fund their animal control departments, as well as send monies to various animal shelters. It is by no means meant as an affront to the independent Maine spirit.Usually, when we let people know that this money can be all the funding some shelters receive in terms of state assistance, they agree that helping animals is worth supporting!\nAn added benefit is that if your dog gets loose with a rabies tag and registration tag on his collar, animal control can easily find out who the animal is and bring him home rather than take him to the local shelter where you would have to post bail!\nAn ounce of prevention truly is worth a pound of cure in the case of rabies as there IS no cure. Prevention is all we have. Please take this disease seriously\n","263":"There are doctors and nurses  around who deny that vaccines can produce any side effects at all. There are,  they claim, no risks whatsoever. Personally, I feel that any doctor who claims  that any vaccine, or any drug, does not produce side effects should be enrolled  into a reliable space programme and shot into orbit. He or she is too dangerous  to practise medicine and far too stupid to be recycled in any useful capacity.  But that's just my personal opinion. The medical establishment, and its very  best chum the international pharmaceutical industry, would undoubtedly rather  see me fired off into space.\nWhen patients fall ill after being  vaccinated the doctors who don't believe that vaccines can cause side effects  (and who probably also believe that the earth is the centre of the universe)  wave aside any link between the two and dismiss the illness as a coincidence.  Whatever happens they arbitrarily decide that it is impossible for any side  effects to be caused by their beloved and highly profitable vaccines. What many  fail to realise is that vaccination damage may occur weeks, months or years  after vaccination. By then the time interval between the vaccination and the  damage may be so long that no one connects the two. \nIf these craven,  witless apologists for vaccination were proper doctors, in the tradition of  Semmelweiss, Snow, Lister and the other gods of medicine, if they cared a  twopenny damn about their patients, or if they had any respect for their  profession, they would, of course, report the potential side effect to the  authorities and allow epidemiologists to decide whether or not specific health  problems were, or were not, associated with vaccination. But sadly, I fear,  doctors have already decided that vaccination is far too profitable a side-line  for them to risk damaging it by finding out the truth. Tragically, many doctors  seem to be painfully ignorant about the vaccines they advocate. They do what  they are told to do, unquestioningly and unthinkingly, and check their bank  balance every month to make sure that the nice, big, fat Government payments  have gone through satisfactorily. \nThe truth is that of all the forms of  drugs available vaccines are the crudest and the most unreliable and the most  dangerous. (They are also the most profitable but that, of course, is merely a  small coincidence.) Vaccines can cause brain damage - and can kill. I'm always  startled that this should surprise anyone. If you inject potentially toxic  substances into small children it seems pretty obvious to me that you will get  problems. The brain is a delicate and easily damaged organ. The developing brain  of a baby or young child is particularly delicate and very easily disrupted. The  most significant known fact about vaccines is that they can cause brain damage.  And they can kill. This isn't theory or supposition. It is fact. For example,  doctors have noticed that there is a relationship between vaccination and  protracted, inconsolable high pitched screaming occurring shortly afterwards.  This seems to be consistent with a link between vaccination and encephalopathy.  This link could be deeply embarrassing for politicians, doctors and drug  companies and has not been properly investigated. \nAstonishingly, when  the American Academy of Paediatrics announced that one in six American children  had a developmental disorder and or a behavioural disorder no one mentioned the  possibility that vaccines might, just might, be responsible. No one in authority  seems to know just why so many American children should be in such poor shape.  `It doesn't seem fair,' said one expert. `We look after our children so well.  American children have more vaccinations than children in any other country.'  Four separate studies have shown that there are higher rates of asthma in fully  vaccinated children. Some doctors believe that the epidemic of ADHD (now  supposed to be affecting millions of children) could be related to vaccination.  If ADHD exists (and there is much doubt about that) then it certainly could be  caused by vaccination. And if it is then the children diagnosed with the disease  are suffering twice. They have been made ill by a vaccine and they are being  treated with heavy medication which is, in my view, too dangerous to use as  landfill. And then there is autism which I have dealt with elsewhere in this  book and which is, when its most serious form, merely an ill-fitting cover up  for brain damage. \nWhen it was announced that from autumn 2008, British  schoolgirls aged 12 to 13 would be vaccinated against cervical cancer it was  estimated that the contract for supplying the vaccine against the human  papillomavirus would be worth hundreds of millions of pounds. But when the  vaccine was introduced it was already known that it could cause problems.  \nHere's a list of some of the side effects which may be caused by  vaccination. Not all vaccines produce all these side effects, of course. But, on  the other hand, this list is by no means complete and there are undoubtedly  other side effects which may result from vaccination: brain damage, paralysis,  pain, fever, nausea, dizziness and itching, Bells Palsy, Guillain-Barre syndrome  and seizures are just some of the more serious problems. Just how many side  effects and problems are there? It's difficult to say. And how common are side  effects? That's also difficult to say. Back in 2007, the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) detailed 1,637 reports of adverse reactions to the  vaccination for human papillomavirus (HPV) including 371 serious reactions and  three deaths. Most of the time, however, the authorities (by which I mean the  Government and the medical establishment) prefer to sweep the details about  vaccine related problems under the carpet rather than to promote them.  \nVaccines can even cause symptoms which seem to me very similar to the  symptoms of the disease they are supposed to prevent. So, for example, the  milder of the `side effects' known to be associated with the flu vaccine  include: fever, tiredness, muscle aching and headache. Are those not the  symptoms of the flu? (Those, by the way, are the manufacturer's list of side  effects, not mine.) A complete list of the possible side effects associated with  the flu vaccine may also include: asthma, brain swelling, Guillian Barre  syndrome, facial paralysis, damage to eye muscles, damage to the arm and  shoulder muscles, bruising, abdominal pain, kidney disorders, hives and  anaphylaxis. A study published in the International Journal of Clinical  Investigation showed that those who have had the flu jab for five years in a  row have a ten fold increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Doctors  always seem to forget to mention this when pushing their annual (and highly  profitable) flu jab campaigns. It is not known whether the flu vaccine can  trigger cancer, infertility or other serious health problems. The body's immune  system fights cancerous cells and, indeed, some anti-cancer therapies are  designed to boost the immune system and to help it fight a developing cancer.  Could repeated vaccinations affect the body's susceptibility to cancer? Could  repeated vaccinations make the body less able to deal with a developing cancer?  Could the constant increase in the incidence of cancer be a result of the  enthusiasm for vaccination programmes which has for decades now been inspired by  drug companies and maintained by Governments and doctors? Dunno. But I do know  that one anti-flu vaccine which was injected into over a million American  citizens contained a cancer-causing monkey virus. Some doctors believe that  vaccination programmes are causing insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The  suggestion is that the diabetes does not develop for several years after the  vaccination. This theory needs investigating. \nIn 1998, the Pentagon,  fearful of germ warfare, began again to vaccinate all military personnel against  anthrax. `We were told to shut up and stick your arm out,' says a former female  helicopter pilot who stopped menstruating after the first shot and had by the  third of the six shot series lost a third of her body weight. As the vaccines'  alleged casualties (including six deaths) mounted so soldiers began to refuse  it. Around 400 resigned or were court martialled for refusing the vaccine. The  irony, of course, was that only the Americans had the capacity to wage  biological war. No one should have been surprised by any of the terrible things  that happened in the late 1990s. Approximately 25 per cent of soldiers  participating in the Gulf War in 1990-1991 were made sick by the anthrax vaccine  they were given. (Incidentally, it has been reported that a component used in  that anthrax vaccine was later introduced in one of the swine flu vaccines  approved for use in the UK.) \nVaccinations have been linked to a number  of other general health problems. It now seems possible, for example, that  individuals who receive vaccinations may be more prone to develop allergies  (such as asthma), arthritis, eczema and bowel disease (such as Irritable Bowel  Syndrome). The explanation - which makes sense to me - is that vaccinations  interfere with the immune system and make the recipients more susceptible to  disease. The human immune system is a wonderland of protection. It is one of  God's great gifts to us. And yet, as I showed in my book Superbody, our  immune systems are being battered and broken and damned near destroyed by  environmental factors largely outside our control. What if vaccines damage the  immune system in some way? We know that when the immune system is damaged people  become more susceptible to illness. And more likely to die. Just how much damage  are vaccines doing? It is possible, and I believe extremely likely, that  vaccines damage the human immune system and, as a result, weaken people and make  them more likely to fall ill in the future. People with poor immune systems are  more susceptible to infectious diseases and more likely to succumb to cancer.  Are some vaccines more dangerous than others? How many people die because their  immune systems have been damaged by vaccines? \nI still have no idea of  the answer to any of these (officially) unasked questions. Your doctor doesn't  have any answers either. He'll waffle and burble and tell you that the  Government says vaccines are wonderful and ask you, with a sneery, knowing  smile, if you really think the Government is out to kill your children and he'll  tell you I'm a dangerous heretic. But he won't have any answers. And, remember,  he gets paid for giving vaccinations. \nIn 1998 the French Government  abandoned its mandatory Hepatitis B vaccine programme for schoolchildren after  more than 15,000 lawsuits were filed for brain damage and autoimmune reactions  including arthritis, multiple sclerosis and lupus. \nIn an infant the  brain is developing very quickly. During this time infants are given an  ever-increasing barrage of vaccinations. You might imagine that dumping all this  potentially toxic stuff into a developing body might put a huge strain on the  developing immune system. Scientists have not yet looked into this. I find  myself constantly puzzled by the failure of other doctors to question what is  happening. Who (other than a drug company spokesman) wouldn't expect an infant  to show serious signs of distress when deliberately injected with potentially  toxic foreign substances? Why shouldn't such injections cause a severe immune  response? What, you may wonder, is the effect of squirting all this gunk into  babies and small children? I certainly wonder. And, I hope that one or two  members of the medical establishment will one day have the wit, and the  conscience, to wonder too. \nMeanwhile, as we wait for more research work  explaining precisely how much vaccines do, we should perhaps all remember that  the American Government has officially recognised that in the year 2010  `perfectly safe' childhood vaccines officially killed or injured 2,699 children  in America. And that, remember, is 2,699 children who were perfectly healthy  before they had their vaccinations. Those children, and their families, paid  quite a price so that drug companies and doctors could make a great deal of  money. We should be aware, too, that there are still many unanswered (and  usually unasked) questions about vaccination. For example, we know that vaccines  cause neurological damage. And we know that the first symptoms of disease may  appear some considerable time after vaccination has taken place. `Is it  possible,' asked my wife, Donna Antoinette, when she had read an early draft of  this book, `that the rise in the incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) could be a  consequence of the increase in childhood vaccination? Could the increase in the  number of young women affected by MS be a result of the extra vaccines now given  to young girls?' I had to tell her that I have no idea. Moreover, I doubt if any  of the gung-ho vaccinators have ever even asked those questions - let alone  thought about answering them. \nFinally, here is a quote from a former  American vaccine researcher: `If I had a child now, the last thing I would allow  is vaccination. I would move out of the State if I had to. I would change the  family name. I would disappear. With my family. I'm not saying it would come to  that. There are ways to sidestep the system with grace, if you know how to act.  There are exemptions you can declare, in every state, based on religious and\/or  philosophic views. But if push came to shove I would go on the  move.'\nTaken  from Vernon Coleman's book Anyone Who Tells You Vaccines Are Safe And  Effective Is Lying. Here's The Proof.

Would a permissive vaccine lead to the emergence of more virulent viruses?\nThis hypothesis is based on the notion that viruses which kill their hosts too quickly are not efficiently transmitted, and are therefore removed by selection. However a vaccine that prevents disease, but not viral replication in the host, would allow\u00c2\u00a0virulent viruses to be maintained in the host population. It has been suggested that in this scenario, viruses with increased virulence would be selected if such a property aids transmission between hosts.\nOn the surface this hypothesis seems reasonable, but in my opinion it is flawed. One problem is that increased transmission might not always be associated with increased virulence. The more serious flaw lies in making anthropomorphic assessments of what we think viruses require, such as concluding that increased viral transmission is a desired trait. Our assumptions fail to recognize the main goal of evolution: survival. Evolution does not move a virus along a trajectory aimed at perfection. Change comes about by eliminating those viruses that are not well adapted for the current conditions, not by building a virus that will fare better tomorrow. All the viruses on Earth today transmit well enough, or they would not be here; yet some kill their hosts clearly much faster than others. The fact is that humans have little understanding of what drives virus evolution in large populations. Our assumptions of what constitute the selective forces are usually tainted by anthropomorphism.\nThis long preamble is an introduction to a series of findings which are purported to support the idea that permissive vaccines (the authors call them \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleaky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimperfect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vaccines but I dislike both names because they imply defects) can lead to the selection of more virulent viruses. The subject of the paper is Marek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease virus (MDV), a herpesvirus that infects chickens. MDV is shed from feather follicles of infected chickens and is spread to other birds when then inhale contaminated dust. Vaccines have been used to prevent MDV infection since the early 1970s. These vaccines prevent disease, but do not block viral replication, and vaccinated, infected birds can shed wild type virus. The virulence of MDV\u00c2\u00a0has been increasing since the 1950s, initially from a paralytic disease, to paralysis and death. The authors wonder if the use of permissive Marek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccines has lead to the selection of more virulent viruses.\nTo address their hypothesis, the authors inoculate vaccinated or unvaccinated chickens with a series of MDV isolates that range from low to high virulence. Unvaccinated chickens inoculated with the most virulent MDV died within a week and shed little virus. In contrast, most vaccinated birds survived infection with virulent viruses, and shed virus for the length of the experiment, 56 days.\nA transmission experiment was done to determine if shed virus could infect other birds. The authors infected vaccinated or unvaccinated birds and asked if sentinel, unvaccinated chickens became infected. Unvaccinated birds died within 10 days after infection with virulent MDV, and did not transmit infection. In contrast, vaccinated birds survived at least 30 days, and co-housed sentinel animals became infected and died.\nThe experiments are well done and the conclusions are clear: more virulent Marek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease viruses replicate longer in vaccinated than unvaccinated chickens, and can be readily transmitted to other chickens. But these results do not prove that more virulent\u00c2\u00a0MDV arose because of permissive vaccines. Nor do the results prove in general that leaky vaccines lead to selection of more virulent viruses. The results simply show that a vaccine that does not prevent replication will allow transmission of virulent viruses.\nTo prove that vaccinated chickens can allow the selection of more virulent viruses, vaccinated chickens could be infected with an avirulent virus, and the shed virus collected and used to infect additional, vaccinated birds. This process could be repeated to determine if more virulent viruses arise. While the results of this gain-of-function experiment would be informative, they would be done in a controlled laboratory setting which would not duplicate all the selective forces present on a poultry farm.\nThe authors note that most human vaccines do prevent replication of infecting virus. They do not mention the one important exception: the Salk poliovirus vaccines. People who are immunized with the Salk vaccine can be infected with poliovirus, which will then replicate in the intestines, be shed in the feces,\u00c2\u00a0and transmitted to others. This behavior has been well documented in human populations, yet the virulence of poliovirus has not increased for the 60 years during which the Salk vaccine has been used.\nI do not feel that these experimental results have general implications for the use of any animal vaccine. It is unfortunate that the work has been covered in many news sources with the incorrect implication that vaccines may be responsible for the emergence of more virulent viruses.\n","265":"In 1962 Roald Dahl's daughter Olivia died of measles encephalitis. Measles causes encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) in about one in every thousand children who get it. Encephalitis is still an extremely serious condition which is difficult to treat and almost always requires admission to an intensive care unit.\nSoon after Olivia died, Roald Dahl wrote the following account in a school exercise book, which he kept hidden away at the back of a drawer in his writing shed. It describes taking his daughter into hospital after she had collapsed at home.\nAwful drive. Lorries kept holding us up on narrow roads. Got to hospital. Ambulance went to wrong entrance. Backed out. Arrived. Young doctor in charge. Mervyn and he gave her 3mg sodium amatol. I sat in hall. Smoked. Felt frozen. A small single bar electric fire on wall. An old man in next room. Woman doctor went to phone. She was trying urgently to locate another doctor. He arrived. I went in. Olivia lying quietly. Still unconscious. She has an even chance, doctor said. They had tapped her spine. Not meningitis. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encephalitis. Mervyn left in my car. I stayed. Pat arrived and went in to see Olivia. Kissed her. Spoke to her. Still unconscious. I went in. I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Olivia\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Olivia.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She raised her head slightly off pillow. Sister said don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I went out. We drank whiskey. I told doctor to consult experts. Call anyone. He called a man in Oxford. I listened. Instructions were given. Not much could be done. I first said I would stay on. Then I said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d go back with Pat. Went. Arrived home. Called Philip Evans. He called hospital. Called me back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shall I come?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes please.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d tell hospital he was coming. I called. Doc thought I was Evans. He said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worse. I got in the car. Got to hospital. Walked in. Two doctors advanced on me from waiting room. How is she? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late. I went into her room. Sheet was over her. Doctor said to nurse go out. Leave him alone. I kissed her. She was warm. I went out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She is warm.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I said to doctors in hall, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why is she so warm?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. I left.\nIn the mid-1980s, over twenty years later, Roald Dahl wrote the following passage, aimed at parents who were refusing to give their children the measles vaccine. (The number of deaths from measles has fallen to almost zero in the UK since this was written. See the 'More information' section of our Measles page for up-to-date information about measles deaths in the UK.)\nOlivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was seven years old.\nAs the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it. Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are you feeling all right?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I asked her.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel all sleepy, \u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.\nIn an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.\nThe measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her.\nThat was twenty-four years ago in 1962, but even now, if a child with measles happens to develop the same deadly reaction from measles as Olivia did, there would still be nothing the doctors could do to help her.\nOn the other hand, there is today something that parents can do to make sure that this sort of tragedy does not happen to a child of theirs. They can insist that their child is immunised against measles. I was unable to do that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable measles vaccine had not been discovered. Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it.\nIt is not yet generally accepted that measles can be a dangerous illness.\nBelieve me, it is. In my opinion parents who now refuse to have their children immunised are putting the lives of those children at risk.\nIn America, where measles immunisation is compulsory, measles like smallpox, has been virtually wiped out.\nHere in Britain, because so many parents refuse, either out of obstinacy or ignorance or fear, to allow their children to be immunised, we still have a hundred thousand cases of measles every year. [NOTE: Since this was written in 1986, the success of the MMR vaccination has reduced this figure to several thousand each year, but unvaccinated children are still at risk, and there are still occasional deaths from measles].\nOut of those, more than 10,000 will suffer side effects of one kind or another.\nAt least 10,000 will develop ear or chest infections.\nAbout 20 will die. [NOTE: The number of deaths from measles has fallen to almost zero in the UK since this was written. The number of people affected by complications of measles has also fallen.]\nLET THAT SINK IN.\nEvery year around 20 children will die in Britain from measles.\nSo what about the risks that your children will run from being immunised?\nThey are almost non-existent. Listen to this. In a district of around 300,000 people, there will be only one child every 250 years who will develop serious side effects from measles immunisation! That is about a million to one chance. I should think there would be more chance of your child choking to death on a chocolate bar than of becoming seriously ill from a measles immunisation.\nSo what on earth are you worrying about?\nIt really is almost a crime to allow your child to go unimmunised.\nThe ideal time to have it done is at 13 months, but it is never too late. All school-children who have not yet had a measles immunisation should beg their parents to arrange for them to have one as soon as possible.\nIncidentally, I dedicated two of my books to Olivia, the first was James and the Giant Peach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That was when she was still alive. The second was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe BFG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, dedicated to her memory after she had died from measles. You will see her name at the beginning of each of these books. And I know how happy she would be if only she could know that her death had helped to save a good deal of illness and death among other children.\nSee also:\nHow ill does measles make you?\nMore information about measles and two short films about measles complications\nA short animation: Why aren't we more scared of measles? \nHi, I am really trying to find some balanced views on the dangers of measles. It's quite scary that you say 'each year 20 children will die from measles in Britain'. Really scary stuff. So I looked at the gov.uk website for the data and found this:\n'Prior to 2006, the last death from acute measles was in 1992. In 2006, there was 1 measles death in a 13-year-old male who had an underlying lung condition and was taking immunosuppressive drugs. Another death in 2008 was also due to acute measles in an unvaccinated child with a congenital immunodeficiency, whose condition did not require treatment with immunoglobulin. In 2013, 1 death was reported in a 25-year-old man following acute pneumonia as a complication of measles.' (https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/measles-deaths-by-age-group-f...)\nSo I am a little confused.\nThanks for your comment, and I apologise for the confusion. Roald Dahl wrote this piece in the mid-1980s, when there were around 20 deaths a year from measles. However, since then measles deaths in the UK have fallen to almost zero. I did actually make this point this just above Roald Dahl's letter to parents, but your comment makes me realise it is still not very clear, so I have added a clarification in the letter itself. I hope this helps.\nVery good information is there on your blog. It is very useful to me.

These are not always exactly the same as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcside effects\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, because reporting an adverse event after vaccination does not prove a link with the vaccine. When a vaccine is given to a very large number of people in a population, it is likely just by chance that a few of them will develop some kind of medical problem around the time of vaccination, but this does not prove \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccause and effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This means that the reactions listed in the product information may not all be side effects of the vaccine itself.\nSome events after immunisation are clearly caused by the vaccine (for example, a sore arm at the injection site). However, others may happen by coincidence around the time of vaccination. It can therefore be difficult to separate those which are clearly caused by a vaccine and those that were going to happen anyway. In clinical trials all serious adverse events are reported so that unexpected reactions to medicines or vaccines can be identified. This is very important for safety monitoring, but it also means that extreme examples of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcadverse events\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 may get listed when they have no connection to the vaccine (such as injuries caused to a passenger in a car accident, which are clearly not related to any vaccine they may have received). Also events such as fainting at the sight of a needle may be called an adverse event, even though the person has not actually received the vaccine.\nHowever, experts consider it important that every single adverse event is collected and reported, so that we can identify any \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsignal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a possible vaccine-caused harm amongst all the chance events that happen to people every day. In the UK it is the job of the MHRA to collect all these reports and investigate further if necessary (see more information on Monitoring of vaccines). Scientific method is then used to determine if these events are a coincidence or a result of the vaccine.\nHere are two examples of how collecting and analysing data on adverse events has helped us to understand more about the safety of vaccines.\nSome studies on the rotavirus vaccine identified that there was possibly a very slightly increased risk of a rare condition called intussusception following vaccination. This was discovered by comparing rates of intussusception in a large group of babies who had received the rotavirus vaccine with rates in a large group of babies who had not received the vaccine. It led to a change in the information in the product leaflet, and also to a change in advice about when the vaccine should be given (see the page on the Rotavirus vaccine for more information about this research).\nA large number of studies on the MMR vaccine have found no increased risk of autism in very large groups of children who have received the vaccine. Again, this has been done by comparing rates of autism in large groups of children who have received the MMR vaccine with large groups who have not (see the page on the MMR vaccine for more information about this research).\nFor information on side effects of individual vaccines, please see the pages on vaccines under 'Information on vaccines'.\n","267":"I think about children and vaccines more than the average person. \u00c2\u00a0I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an emergency medicine physician, and a parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to vaccinate his or her child affects my job every single shift.\nChildren get fevers frequently. \u00c2\u00a0Current research suggests that the average child not in daycare will have between 6-8 fevers per year between the ages of 0-3, and children in daycare will average 10-12 fevers per year. \u00c2\u00a0Fevers can be scary, and those children and frightened parents often end up in the emergency room.\nEvery visit for a febrile child begins with a conversation with the parents and an examination of the child. \u00c2\u00a0As long as the child looks well\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmeaning he or she will interact, make eye contact, and act appropriately for his or her age\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthe next most important question is about the child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaccination status. Depending on the parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decisions on vaccination, the visit then can follow one of two paths.\nFor children who are fully vaccinated and over six months of age, I search for a source of the infection based on their symptoms; if they are coughing or have other signs of a respiratory infection, the child gets a chest x-ray. \u00c2\u00a0Young girls and uncircumcised males are at higher risk for bladder infections, so we usually do a urine test. \u00c2\u00a0If those are all negative, we usually send the child home with no medications and the expectation that the fever is caused by a virus and will soon go away.\nUnvaccinated children, however, require much more testing. \u00c2\u00a0Most practice guidelines recommend multiple blood tests, which require an IV, urine testing, a chest x-ray, and, depending on the child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s age and other risk factors, possibly a lumbar puncture (a.k.a. \u00c2\u00a0spinal tap).\nBased on those results, children are sometimes then treated with antibiotics via another injection, and then have to see their primary doctor within twenty-four hours to continue the antibiotics and often have more blood tests done.\nThis disparity in how children are evaluated in the ER is based on very basic differences in how high of a risk children are at for invasive bacterial infections. \u00c2\u00a0For children who are unvaccinated, some estimates as high as 5-8%* of them have a serious infection in their bloodstream (bacteremia) or around their brain (meningitis). \u00c2\u00a0For children who are fully vaccinated, the risk of bloodstream and brain infections is less than 0.001%.\nI fully support parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights to choose not to vaccinate, but there are consequences to that decision. \u00c2\u00a0I have had many conversations with parents in the middle of the night when their child has a fever and had to explain to them that because of their decision to not vaccinate, research indicates that their child is at a significantly increased risk for life-threatening diseases, and so will need invasive testing in the ER. \u00c2\u00a0It will take hours, and it will hurt their child. \u00c2\u00a0I tell them that the diseases we vaccinate against aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just nuisances; they kill and maim children every day, and they are almost completely preventable by vaccination.\nI tell parents that I have worked in several developing countries, and I have seen children disfigured by diseases that we only read about in history books. \u00c2\u00a0I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen babies die of diseases that in the U.S. we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even think about as a cause of illness because vaccination has nearly eliminated the illness. \u00c2\u00a0However, these illnesses are starting to make a comeback because of the anti-vaccine movement.\nI also tell them that as a parent of two boys, I carefully research every vaccine and medicine that my children are given. \u00c2\u00a0I read the medical journals on the topic, and examine the evidence for myself about all of the controversies about thimerosal and autism and invasive disease. \u00c2\u00a0Then I tell them that after many hours of studying the best research available, I am first in line to have my children vaccinated every time they are due.\nDr. Torree McGowan, MD, graduated from Oregon Health and Sciences University. \u00c2\u00a0She is a Fellow of the American College of Emergency Medicine and is a practicing emergency physician in California. \u00c2\u00a0She is the proud mother of two little boys.\u00c2\u00a0\n* The 5-8% number is based on pre-vaccine era numbers of children who\u00c2\u00a0presented to either ERs or pediatricians who had fevers higher than\u00c2\u00a0102.2F (39C). Prior to routine HIB vaccination, the number was around\u00c2\u00a08%, and then fell to around 5% after HIB vaccinations. That number has\u00c2\u00a0continued to fall since 2000, when the pneumococcal vaccine was\u00c2\u00a0introduced, to the current state, which is about a 0.9% occult\u00c2\u00a0bacteremia rate, most of which are Strep pneumonia isolates. Now that\u00c2\u00a0the new Prevnar vaccine has been introduced in the past 2 years that has\u00c2\u00a013 serotypes, we expect that number to fall even further. The true rate\u00c2\u00a0of disease for unvaccinated children in the US is probably lower than\u00c2\u00a0the 5-8% estimated from pre-vaccine era studies because of herd\u00c2\u00a0immunity, but those are the numbers we typically use to estimate risk\u00c2\u00a0for children who are not vaccinated, simply because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best data\u00c2\u00a0we have. [See abstracts #1, #2, and #3.]\nThe number for the fully vaccinated risk of bacteremia and meningitis is\u00c2\u00a0based on 7-9% progression from bacteremia to meningitis of the 0.9% of\u00c2\u00a0children with occult bacteremia (0.009*0.7 = 0.00063 or 0.063%). \u00c2\u00a0The progression from\u00c2\u00a0occult bacteremia to meningitis may be even lower, because 80% of the\u00c2\u00a0meningitis was caused by pneumococcus, which we now vaccinate against.\n","268":"I am the 70s child of a health nut. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinated. I was brought up on an incredibly healthy diet: no sugar til I was one, breastfed for over a year, organic homegrown vegetables, raw milk, no MSG, no additives, no aspartame. My mother used homeopathy, aromatherapy, osteopathy, we took daily supplements of vitamin C, echinacea, cod liver oil. I had an outdoor lifestyle; I grew up next to a farm, walked everywhere, did sports and danced twice a week, drank plenty of water. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even allowed pop; even my fresh juice was watered down to protect my teeth, and I would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve killed for white, shop-bought bread in my lunch box once in a while and biscuits instead of fruit like all the other kids. We only ate (organic local) meat maybe once or twice a week and my mother and father cooked everything from scratch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I have yet to taste a Findus crispy pancake and oven chips were reserved for those nights when mum and dad had friends over and we got a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAs healthy as my lifestyle seemed, I contracted measles, mumps, rubella, a type of viral meningitis, scarlatina, whooping cough, yearly tonsillitis, and chickenpox, some of which are vaccine preventable. In my twenties I got precancerous HPV and spent 6 months of my life wondering how I was going to tell my two children under the age of 7 that mummy might have cancer before it was safely removed.\nSo having the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural immunity sterilised out of us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut it for me. How could I, with my idyllic childhood and my amazing health food, get so freaking ill all the time? My mother was the biggest health freak around\u00e2\u20ac\u201cshe would put most of my current \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crunchy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd friends to shame. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink, she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t smoke, she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do drugs and we certainly weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allowed to watch whatever we wanted on telly or wear plastic shoes or any of that stuff. She LIVED alternative health. And you know what? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad she gave us the great diet that we had, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad that she cared about us in that way.\nBut it just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop me getting childhood illnesses.\nMy two vaccinated children, on the other hand, have rarely been ill, have had antibiotics maybe twice in their lives, if that (not like me who got so many illnesses which needed treatment with antibiotics that I developed a resistance to them, which led me to be hospitalized with penicillin-resistant quinsy at 21\u00e2\u20ac\u201cyou know that old fashioned disease that killed Queen Elizabeth I and which was almost wiped out through use of antibiotics).\nMy kids have had no childhood illnesses other than chickenpox, which they both contracted while still breastfeeding. They too grew up on a healthy diet, homegrown organics etc. Not to the same extent as I did, though, as I was not quite as strict as my mother, but they are both healthier than I have ever been.\nI find myself wondering about the claim that complications from childhood illnesses are extremely rare but that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccine injuries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are rampant. If this is the case, I struggle to understand why I know far more people who have experienced complications from preventable childhood illnesses than I have EVER met with complications from vaccines. I have friends who became deaf from measles. I have a partially sighted friend who contracted rubella in the womb. My ex got pneumonia from chickenpox. A friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother died from meningitis.\nAnecdotal evidence is nothing to base decisions on. But when facts and evidence-based science aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good enough to sway someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinion, then this is where I come from. After all, anecdotes are the anti-vaccine supporter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way. Well, this is my personal experience. And my personal experience prompts me to vaccinate my children and myself. I got the flu vaccine recently, and I am getting the whooping cough booster to protect my unborn baby. My natural immunity from having whooping cough at age 5 will not protect him once he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s born.\nI understand, to a point, where the anti-vaccine parents are coming from. Back in the 90s when I was a concerned, 19-year-old mother, frightened by the world I was bringing my child into, I was studying homeopathy, herbalism and aromatherapy; I believed in angels, witchcraft, clairvoyants, crop circles, aliens at Nazca, giant ginger mariners spreading their knowledge to the Aztecs, the Incas and the Egyptians and that I was somehow personally blessed by the Holy Spirit with healing abilities. I was having my aura read at a hefty price and filtering the fluoride out of my water. I was choosing to have past life regressions instead of taking anti-depressants. I was taking my daily advice from tarot cards. I grew all my own veg and made my own herbal remedies. I was so freaking crunchy that I literally crumbled. It was only when I took control of those paranoid thoughts and fears about the world around me and became an objective critical thinker that I got well. It was when I stopped taking sugar pills for everything and started seeing medical professionals that I began to thrive physically and mentally.\nIf you think your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system is strong enough to fight off vaccine-preventable diseases, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong enough to fight off the tiny amounts of dead or weakened pathogens present in any of the vaccines. But not everyone around you is that strong, not everyone has a choice, not everyone can fight those illnesses, and not everyone can be vaccinated. If you have a healthy child, then your healthy child can cope with vaccines and can care about those unhealthy children who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Teach your child compassion, and teach your child a sense of responsibility for those around them. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t teach your child to be self serving and scared of the world in which it lives and the people around him\/her. And teach them to LOVE people with ASD or any other disability for that matter, not to label them as damaged.\nAnd lastly but most importantly for me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c knowingly exposing your child to childhood illnesses is cruel; even without complications these diseases aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly pleasant. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about you, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy watching children suffer even with a cold or a hurt knee. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never had these illnesses you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how awful they are\u00e2\u20ac\u201cI do. Pain, discomfort, the inability to breathe or to eat or to swallow, fever and nightmares, itching all over your body so much that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stand lying on bed sheets, losing so much weight you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk properly, diarrhea that leaves you lying prostrate on the bathroom floor, the unpaid time off work for parents (and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re self employed that means NO INCOME), the quarantine, missing school, missing parties, the worry, the sleepless nights, the sweat, the tears and the blood, the midnight visits to A and E, sitting in a doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waiting room on your own because no one will sit near you because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re rightfully scared of those spots all over your kids face.\nThose of you who have avoided childhood illnesses without vaccines are lucky. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it without us pro-vaxxers. Once the vaccination rates begin dropping, the less herd immunity will be able to protect your children. The more people you convert to your anti-vax stance, the quicker that luck will run out.\nAmy Parker is a 37 year old mother of two teenagers, with a new arrival on the way.

Bill Zedler (R-Arlington) and Jason Villalba (R-Dallas); and Anna Dragsbaek, president and chief executive of the Immunization Partnership were among the speakers. (Marjorie Kamys Cotera\/For the Texas Tribune) \n AUSTIN \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The group of 40 people gathered at a popular burger and fish taco restaurant in San Antonio listened eagerly to the latest news about the anti-vaccine fight taking place in the Texas legislature.\nSome mothers in the group had stopped immunizing their young children because of doubts about vaccine safety. Heads nodded as the woman giving the statehouse update warned that vaccine advocates wanted to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chip away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 right to choose. But she also had encouraging news.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have 30 champions in that statehouse,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd boasted Jackie Schlegel, executive director of Texans for Vaccine Choice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last session, we had two.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nNow they also have one in the White House.\nPresident Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embrace of discredited theories linking vaccines to autism has energized the anti-vaccine movement. Once fringe, the movement is becoming more popular, raising doubts about basic childhood health care among politically and geographically diverse groups.\nPublic health experts warn that this growing movement is threatening one of the most successful medical innovations of modern times. Globally, vaccines prevent the deaths of about 2.5 million children every year, but deadly diseases such as measles and whooping cough still circulate in populations where enough people are unvaccinated.\nIn San Antonio, 80 miles southwest of the state capital, Texans for Vaccine Choice convened a happy hour to encourage attendees to get more involved politically. The event was among dozens of outreach events the group has hosted across the state. The relatively new group has boosted its profile, aided by a savvy social-media strategy, and now leads a contentious fight over vaccines that is gearing up in the current legislative session.\nThe battle comes at a time when increasing numbers of Texas parents are choosing not to immunize their children because of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal beliefs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Measles was eliminated in the United States more than 15 years ago, but the highly contagious disease has made a return in recent years, including in Texas, in part because of parents refusing to vaccinate their children. A 2013 outbreak in Texas infected 21 people, many of them unvaccinated children.\nThe modern anti-vaccine movement is based on a fraud. A study published almost 20 years ago purported to show a link between childhood vaccines and autism. The data was later found to be falsified, and the study was retracted.\nScores of large-scale, long-term studies from around the world since then have proved that there is no connection between vaccines and autism. But the suspicion lingers. Its strongest form is a stubborn conspiracy theory that doctors, scientists, federal health agencies, vaccine-makers and the worldwide public health community are hiding the truth and are knowingly harming children.\nA leading conspiracy theorist is Andrew Wakefield, author of the 1998 study that needlessly triggered the first fears. (The medical journal BMJ, in a 2011 review of the debacle, described the paper as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fatally flawed both scientifically and ethically.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) Wakefield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Twitter handle identifies him as a doctor, but his medical license has been revoked. The British native now lives in Austin, where he is active in the state and national anti-vaccine movement.\nTrump has met with Wakefield, who attended an inaugural ball and told supporters afterward that he had received \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous support\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for his efforts and hoped to have more meetings with the president.\nPeter Hotez, director of the Texas Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, predicts that 2017 could be the year the anti-vaccination movement gains ascendancy in the United States. Texas could lead the way, he said, because some public schools are dangerously close to the threshold at which measles outbreaks can be expected. A third of students at some private schools are unvaccinated.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re losing the battle,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hotez said.\nAlthough the anti-vaccine movement has been strong in other states, including California, Oregon, Washington and Colorado, experts say the effort in Texas is among the most organized and politically active.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great example of an issue that has a targeted, small minority but an intense minority who are willing to mobilize and engage in direct action,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston.\nThe vast majority of parents in Texas and across the country vaccinate their children. Most people have never had to think much about this basic preventive-medicine practice.\nBut now immunization advocates are realizing that they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let vaccine critics go unchallenged, saying they need voices other than scientists and experts to make the case. They are recruiting teachers and grass-roots groups to explain how immunization protects families and communities.\n Jinny Suh plays with her 4-month-old son while her husband and other son play a video game at their home in Austin on Feb. 9. Suh is a pro-vaccine advocate in addition to running her own businesses from home. (Cooper Neill for The Washington Post) \nJinny Suh, 39, runs one such group, Immunize Texas  , from her Austin home, where she lives with her husband and two young sons. Their house is about three miles from the Austin Waldorf School, a private school where 158 students \u00e2\u20ac\u201d more than 40 percent of the school population \u00e2\u20ac\u201d are unvaccinated, and tuition costs more than $14,000 a year.\nSuh worries about the risk that the school\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unvaccinated children pose to her 4-month-old, who is too young to be immunized. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there are people I go to the grocery store with and go to the park with\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who have unimmunized children, she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a public hazard. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see germs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThose who oppose vaccination are driven by fear, even though it is misguided, and that fear drives passion, she said. But parents who support vaccination \u00e2\u20ac\u0153need to step up our passion and speak up for science \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and for children,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.\nStates set their own day-care and school vaccination requirements. Students in Texas are required to receive seven vaccinations before they attend school, unless their families file an exemption.\nIn Texas, the number of school-age children who are not vaccinated has soared since 2003, when the state expanded its exemption criteria to include reasons of conscience. Personal-belief exemptions increased from 2,314 in the 2003-2004 school year to 44,716 in 2015-2016.\nOverall statewide vaccination rates remain high \u00e2\u20ac\u201d over 98\u00c2\u00a0percent. But in some parts of Texas, vaccine coverage is slipping below the 90 to 95 percent level that experts say is needed to prevent an outbreak. Many private schools, including in the Austin area, have the highest rates of unvaccinated children, exceeding 20 percent.\nWakefield has stoked parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 unfounded fears about vaccines, even though his study was withdrawn and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s General Medical Council stripped him of his medical license in 2010. In a brief phone interview, Wakefield said he had not spoken to Trump since last summer. He declined to say how he was invited to an inaugural ball. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Better to say nothing at this stage,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Wakefield said he was heading to Europe to promote \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vaxxed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the movie he directed and co-wrote in which he defends the debunked link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and autism. Texans for Vaccine Choice has sponsored showings of the film and promotes it on its Facebook page.\nOne part of the anti-vaccine movement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message is that vaccine-preventable diseases aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dangerous if people get modern medical care. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a myth, and the failure to vaccinate can be catastrophic.\nTexas health data shows a steady uptick in diseases such as pertussis and mumps in recent years. A recent mumps outbreak in Johnson County, southwest of Dallas, sickened at least 167 people, mostly students. In 2013, Texas experienced the largest outbreak of whooping cough, or pertussis, since 1959: nearly 4,000 cases. Five newborns who were too young to be vaccinated died.\nAlthough anti-vaccine groups are gaining momentum in Texas, other states have shown that they can be fought. In 2015, California passed one of the strictest vaccine requirement laws in the country, mandating that almost all schoolchildren be fully vaccinated to go to school. Exemptions are allowed only for documented medical conditions. The law was sparked by a 2014-2015 measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in California, where a single unvaccinated child with measles led to the infections of 131 people.\nA Texas lawmaker tried to pass a similar bill during the legislative session in 2015. (Texas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislature meets every other year.) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was clear common sense,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd recalled Republican Rep. Jason Villalba, a Dallas lawyer. Mumps was resurgent in the state, including in his district, and his youngest child wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t old enough to be immunized.\nThe bill never made it out of committee. But it sparked a huge reaction and was the reason Schlegel and about 20 other mothers formed Texans for Vaccine Choice. The group claimed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that I was a mad scientist, stripping liberties from parents,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Villalba recalled.\nHe said Texas lawmakers are not likely to pass any legislation that could be viewed as government intrusion into parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights. He is not planning to take up the fight against nonmedical exemptions again \u00e2\u20ac\u201d unless there is a measles outbreak.\nIn the current legislative session, no bills have been filed to eliminate the personal-belief exemptions. In fact, vaccine opponents have introduced a bill to simplify the exemption process.\nBut pro-vaccine advocates are expected to try to change the law and give parents the right to know the number of unimmunized children at individual schools, information that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not readily available now.\nOne bill already introduced would require parents to complete an online education course before seeking a vaccine exemption. Another would make it easier for teenagers to get vaccinated against cancer-causing human papillomavirus (HPV).\nThe bills\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sponsor, Republican Rep. Sarah Davis, a Houston lawyer whose district is home to some of Texas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most well-known hospitals, said the bills are common-sense legislation that would better protect children.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The more active the anti-vaxxers have become, the more that other members start to question whether vaccines are controversial, and most legislators are not wanting to make waves,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.\nPeople on both sides of the vaccine issue are lobbying lawmakers and their staffs, and activity is sure to intensify before the session, which began Jan. 10, ends in May.\nVaccines aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a standard conservative or liberal issue. In many parts of the country, pockets of unimmunized children tend to be in white, upper-middle-class neighborhoods, including in Austin, said Anna Dragsbaek, who heads the Immunization Partnership, a Houston-based immunization advocacy group.\nOne particularly strong strain of anti-vaccine rhetoric in Texas is libertarian and anti-government. Texans for Vaccine Choice receives help and expertise from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153friendly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lawmakers and groups such as Empower Texans, said Jonathan Stickland, a tea party Republican representative from Tarrant County and a key supporter. Political experts consider Empower Texans the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most sophisticated and influential conservative organization.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our message resonates with people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Schlegel, 37, in a brief interview after a day of meetings at the Capitol. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Texans value parental rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a message of liberty. We have a message of choice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nSchlegel has an assistant who helps coordinate her schedule. The group has a director of state policy. Its Facebook page posts regular updates on Schlegel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meetings with lawmakers. The group hands out sophisticated, glossy materials \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in red, white and blue \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to lawmakers.\nThe packets, with business cards tucked inside, lay out the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positions, the bills it supports and the ones it opposes. One leaflet describes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the lack of safety testing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153questionable ingredients\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in vaccines. (To be clear, vaccines and their ingredients are some of the most carefully tested medical interventions in history.) Another calls the current recommended schedule of vaccines \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the most aggressive and bloated of ANY other nation on the planet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nWhen the group recently sought volunteers on Facebook for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153engagement days\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the state Capitol this month and in March, one woman said she wanted to help but was concerned she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know enough about vaccines. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, she was told. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Very little talk about vaccines and a LOT of talk about parental rights and CHOICE.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and 350 other medical, professional and advocacy groups recently wrote a letter to Trump expressing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unequivocal support\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for vaccines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 safety and endorsing the recommended schedule. The letter has links to more than 40 major studies on safety and effectiveness.\nBut immunization advocates like Suh say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to counter the passion of her opponents. Most people consider vaccinations to be such a basic part of life, like clean drinking water, that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to motivate them to take time to show up at lawmakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 offices.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re completely outgunned,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Suh, adding there are only about a dozen members whom she can call on to show up for events. Immunize Texas is part of the Immunization Project.\nSuh often writes emails and posts to the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Facebook account from her cellphone while caring for her two sons. She juggles her immunization advocacy, a mostly volunteer gig, with other businesses she runs from home.\nTo present herself and other mothers as the face of vaccine advocates, she and Jessica Cleary-Kemp, seven months pregnant and mother of a 13-year-old and a 2-year-old, met recently with several lawmakers. One was J.D. Sheffield, a Republican state representative who sought during the last session to require individual schools to provide immunization exemption data.\nSuh jiggled her son on her lap while Cleary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son played a game on an iPad. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not yet clear whether Sheffield or another lawmaker will introduce the bill this session. But they all agreed it will be a controversial issue.\nTo help get their social-media message out, Suh may need to redo the logo for the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. Buttons and T-shirts are another idea. But first, she needs to be better prepared for the next face-to-face meetings.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153People kept asking for business cards,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So we need to get some.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \nAlice Crites contributed to this report from Washington, and Eva Ruth Moravec contributed from San Antonio.\n","270":"         What are hepatitis A and B?       \nThey are viruses that cause inflammation of the liver and can lead to long-term and even life-threatening problems.\n         What are the symptoms?       \nMany people with hepatitis don't have symptoms. But if you do, you may have a fever, fatigue, nausea, and a loss of appetite. Children may have severe stomach pains and diarrhea.\n         How do you get these viruses?       \nHepatitis A is extremely contagious. You can get it by having close contact with someone who has it, or through contaminated food or water.\u00c2\u00a0\nYou can get hepatitis B through contact with bodily fluids, like blood and semen, from someone who has it, or by sharing their personal items like razors or toothbrushes. You can also get it from sharing dirty needles used for injecting illegal drugs, and from body piercings and tattoos given with needles that aren't sterilized. Women with hepatitis B can also pass it to their babies during birth. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the disease from casual contact.\nWhen adults get hepatitis B, it's usually a short-term infection. But about 90% of babies born with it will have a long-term infection.\n         Do I need the hepatitis A or B vaccines?       \nYou should get the hep A vaccine if you:\nYou should get the hepatitis B vaccine if you:\nYou can get the vaccines separately, but there's also a combination vaccine that will protect you against both types of hepatitis. It's given in three or four doses over several months.\n         Do my children need the vaccines?       \nYes. All babies should be vaccinated for hepatitis B at birth, and for hepatitis A at age 1.\n         What are the side effects of the vaccines?       \nMost people don't have any. You may feel sore and notice some redness at the injection site.\n         Who shouldn't get the vaccine?       \nThe hepatitis A vaccine should not be given to children under 1 year old. Don't get either the A or B vaccine if you've had a severe allergic reaction after a dose of the vaccine, or if you're allergic to any of their ingredients. Talk to your doctor if you have severe allergies.\n","271":"MONDAY, March 16, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Pockets of unvaccinated children appear to have fueled the recent measles outbreak traced to Disney theme parks in California, researchers report.\n\"The Disneyland outbreak is quite possibly a direct consequence of the growing anti-vaccination movement in the United States,\" said study author Maimuna Majumder, a research fellow at Boston Children's Hospital.\nAlthough the person who started the outbreak has not been identified, the researchers analyzed outbreak data and found the rapid spread of the disease indicates that most of those infected were not vaccinated or were incompletely vaccinated.\nAs of March 6, 142 of the 173 measles cases in the United States had been tied to the Disney outbreak that began last December, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAlthough the national average for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination in the United States is quite high -- about 92 percent -- pockets of under-vaccinated children are breeding grounds for outbreaks, Majumder explained.\nThe researchers found that \"substandard\" vaccination is likely to blame for the Disney measles outbreak. \"Substandard vaccination means that less than 96 to 99 percent of the population exposed to measles during the course of the outbreak were vaccinated,\" she said.\nBecause measles is so contagious, that high level of vaccination coverage is necessary to prevent outbreaks, Majumder noted. \"In our study, we found that MMR vaccination rates among the exposed population [in the outbreak] may be as low as 50 percent and likely no higher than 86 percent,\" she added.\n\"If the anti-vaccination movement in the U.S. continues to grow, the likelihood of outbreaks will increase -- as will their scale and scope,\" Majumder said.\nThe report was published as a research letter in the March 16 online edition of the journal JAMA Pediatrics.\nDr. Paul Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said, \"As herd immunity erodes, it's the most contagious diseases that come back first.\"\nHerd immunity occurs when most of the population has been vaccinated for an infectious disease, thereby providing some protection for people who are not vaccinated.\nOffit said the measles vaccine is \"so effective that you can eliminate the disease as we did by 2000. But it's a highly contagious disease, so if you get any sort of erosion in herd immunity, the disease comes back,\" he said.\nWhile measles is not particularly fatal for healthy children, it can cause severe complications among those with weakened immune systems, Majumder said.\n\"Unfortunately, these children are often ineligible for the vaccine and thus must rely on the immunity of their neighbors, friends and peers to stay safe. So, if you can get vaccinated, do get vaccinated -- herd immunity depends on it,\" she said.\nOffit thinks that the Disney outbreak may be a tipping point in public opinion on the issue.\n\"I have never seen so much anger towards parents who are choosing not to vaccinate,\" he said. \"There was something about the Disney outbreak that really upset people.\"\nAccording to a recent HealthDay\/Harris Poll, 87 percent of more than 2,000 adults surveyed said they thought that the vaccines routinely given to young children are safe. That's up from 77 percent found in a similar poll last July.\nAmong the poll's other findings:\nDr. Vincenzo Maniaci, an attending emergency physician at Miami Children's Hospital, said despite the renewed interest in vaccinations, under-vaccination remains a major public health problem.\n\"Vaccination rates in some areas of the country have gotten so low that it's concerning,\" he said. \"There are going to be more major outbreaks. It's just a matter of time.\"\n","272":"You may have a family member who has viral hepatitis. Or perhaps you recently saw a news brief about a celebrity who contracted hepatitis A or B. Whatever the reason, you want information about a viral illness that you may not have thought much about. What is viral hepatitis? Are you at risk for it? Do you need viral hepatitis vaccines?\nHepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, most often caused by a viral infection. There are three common types of hepatitis caused by viruses: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Vaccines have been developed that protect people from contracting hepatitis A and B. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.\nHepatitis A and hepatitis B can be spread from person to person, although in different ways. They have similar symptoms, which include abdominal pain, fever, fatigue, joint pain, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). \nOver the last 20 years, there has been a 90% decrease in cases of hepatitis A and an 80% decrease in hepatitis B cases in the U.S. Health experts believe that immunization efforts have led to this drop in rates of infection.\n           Hepatitis A: About 20,000 people in the U.S. contract hepatitis A each year. The hepatitis A virus is found in the stool of the infected person. It is spread through contaminated food or water or by certain types of sexual contact. \nChildren who get hepatitis A often don't have symptoms, so they can have the virus and not know it. However, they can still spread it easily. Fortunately, children are now routinely vaccinated against hepatitis A. \nMost people who get hepatitis A recover completely within two weeks to six months and don't have any liver damage. In rare cases, hepatitis A can cause liver failure and even death in older adults or people with underlying liver disease.\n           Hepatitis B: Every year, about 40,000 people in the U.S. become infected with hepatitis B. Acute hepatitis lasts from a few weeks to several months. Many infected people are able to clear the virus and remain virus-free after the acute stage. However, for others, the virus remains in the body, and they develop chronic hepatitis B infection, which is a serious, lifelong condition. About 1.2 million people in the U.S. have chronic hepatitis B. Of these, 15% to 25% will develop more serious health problems, such as liver damage, cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer, and some people die as a result of hepatitis B-related disease.\nHepatitis B can be spread from one person to another from the blood, semen, or other body fluids of an infected person. In the U.S., sexual contact is the most common way that hepatitis B is spread. It can also be spread by sharing needles or other equipment used to inject drugs. In addition, a mother can pass hepatitis B to her baby during birth. \nHepatitis B cannot be spread by contaminated water, food, cooking, or eating utensils, or by breastfeeding, coughing, sneezing, or close contact such as kissing and hugging.\nOur immune system battles foreign invaders every day, such as when we get a cold virus. When this happens, we develop immunity to that specific virus. This means that our body will fight off the virus if it is ever exposed to it again. \nThe same protection happens with vaccines. However, the benefit of a vaccination is that you don't have to go through being sick to enable your body to fight off disease.\nGregory Poland, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, explains that hepatitis vaccinations contain a small amount of the inactive virus. When you get a dose of the vaccine, he says, your immune cells respond by developing immunity against the virus. This immunity lasts over a long period of time. \n\"So if I get these two doses of hepatitis A vaccine, and then I get exposed 30 years from now, my body will remember that immunity to the vaccine and rapidly start producing antibodies again,\" says Poland. \nDue to the way hepatitis vaccinations are developed, it is impossible to contract the virus from the vaccine itself, according to Poland. \nThe hepatitis A vaccine is usually given in two shots and the hepatitis B vaccine is administered as a series of three shots. The most common side effects are redness, pain, and tenderness where the shots are given.\nTo get long-term protection from these viruses, it's important to receive all the shots as scheduled. However, if you received one shot and never went back for the others, it's not too late to catch up. \n\"No matter how long the lapse is between doses, you never have to start the series again,\" says Poland. \"You just take off where you left off. So even if someone got their first dose five years ago, we start with the second dose.\"\nSince the vaccines were first developed, the hepatitis A and B vaccines have become part of the regular childhood immunization schedule. They are not considered a routine adult immunization. \n\"When we're talking about adults, I would say yes, get the vaccine if they fit into one of these risk factors\" says Poland. \"If they don't fit into the risk factors, their risk is so low that there's no compelling reason to do it.\" \n","273":"The hepatitis A vaccine can prevent hepatitis A, which can be a serious (although rarely fatal) liver disease that may require hospitalization. The hepatitis A virus, present in the stool of infected people, spreads through:\nIf you get hepatitis A as an adult, you are more likely to have signs and symptoms than young children who are infected. Symptoms may last less than two months and include:\nYou receive the injection of the hepatitis A vaccine in the muscle of your upper arm. Start the vaccine series when you are at risk of infection and at least one month before traveling. You need two doses at least six months apart.\nThere are also combination vaccines for adults that protect against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B. However, these have a different dosing schedule. Ask your doctor for details. You might prefer this option if, for example, you are traveling to countries with high rates of both diseases.\nIt's good to know you cannot become infected by getting the hepatitis A vaccine. But in very rare cases, people can have a severe allergic reaction to the hepatitis A vaccine. This occurs within a few minutes to hours of getting the shot. In extremely rare cases, this reaction can be fatal. It's important to remember that the risks from the disease are much greater than the risk from the vaccine itself.\n","274":"Chickenpox is a common illness caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Symptoms of chickenpox include fever and itchy spots or blisters all over the body. Chickenpox is usually mild and runs its course in five to 10 days, but it can cause more serious problems when teens and adults get it. People with weakened immune systems are especially susceptible to developing serious complications from chickenpox.\nSome complications that can arise from chickenpox include:\nVaccination is the best way to prevent chickenpox. A chickenpox vaccine has been available in the U.S. since 1995 and is easy to get from a doctor or a public health clinic. The chickenpox vaccine is very effective at preventing the disease -- between 70% and 90% of people who get vaccinated will be completely immune to chickenpox. If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, the symptoms will be very mild and only last for a few days.\nAll adults who have never had chickenpox or received the vaccination should be vaccinated against it. Two doses of the vaccine should be given at least four weeks apart.\nIf you've never had chickenpox or been vaccinated and you are exposed to chickenpox, being vaccinated right away will greatly reduce your risk of getting sick. Studies have shown that vaccination within three days of exposure is 90% effective at preventing illness; vaccination within five days of exposure is 70% effective. If you do get sick, the symptoms will be milder and shorter in duration.\nThe most common side effect from the chickenpox vaccine is swelling, soreness, or redness at the site of the injection. A small number of people may also develop a mild rash or a low-grade fever after vaccination.\nSerious reactions to the chickenpox vaccine are extremely rare, but they may include:\nIf you think you may be having a serious reaction to the chickenpox vaccine, call your health care provider right away. Make a note of the symptoms you're experiencing, and report them to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at 1-800-822-7967.\nWomen who receive the chickenpox vaccine during pregnancy should contact their health care provider right away. Chickenpox during pregnancy can cause birth defects, so there may be a risk that the chickenpox vaccine could cause the same birth defects.\nAs with other vaccines, the risks associated with the chickenpox vaccine are much lower than the risks associated with the disease itself.\n","275":"The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles). Many children in the U.S. are immunized as infants and toddlers, but that doesn't guarantee lifetime protection. And not everyone gets vaccinated as a child. Many adults move to the U.S. from countries without immunization programs. World travel increases the chances of these diseases spreading.\nGenerally, adults born before 1957 are considered immune to measles and mumps. The CDC advises most adults born in 1957 or afterward who can't show that they've had all 3 diseases get an MMR vaccine, whether they had one as a child or not.\nThe three diseases covered by the MMR vaccine -- measles, mumps, and rubella -- are highly contagious. Viruses cause all three of these illnesses, and they spread through the air. They can pass from person to person through coughing, sneezing, or just breathing.\n         Measles. This disease causes a fever, runny nose, and rash. It attacks the throat and lungs. Vaccinations have helped stop the spread of the disease in the U.S., but there are still cases reported. While immunization rates are on the rise around the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates there were 114,900 deaths from measles in 2014. Measles outbreaks often happen in countries without strong childhood immunization programs. But outbreaks have also happened in Europe, South Africa, and the Philippines.\n         Mumps. This disease causes fever, fatigue, head and muscle aches, and swelling of the salivary glands. In men, it can cause the testicles to become inflamed. Mumps can lead to a loss of hearing, infection of the covering around the brain and spinal cord, and other serious problems. Mumps outbreaks do still happen in the U.S., but rarely.\n         Rubella (German measles). This disease can cause a fever and rash. It's especially dangerous if a pregnant mother has it. Rubella can lead to serious birth defects, including heart problems, deafness, liver and spleen damage, and mental retardation. If a woman has rubella while pregnant, there's at least a 20% chance her baby will have problems.\nThe CDC says most adults born in 1957 or later should get at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. Because of the risk of birth defects, all women of childbearing age should have the MMR vaccine unless they're pregnant or have proof of immunity, or proof of already being vaccinated for rubella.\nThe CDC says adults at greater risk of measles or mumps should get two doses of MMR vaccine, the second one 4 weeks after the first. This includes adults who:\nFor measles, the CDC advises a second dose for adults who:\nAdults don't need the MMR vaccine if:\nAdults who should not have the MMR vaccine include people in these groups:\n         Pregnancy. Pregnant women should not get the MMR vaccine due to risks to the baby. Women who get the MMR vaccine should wait 4 weeks before getting pregnant.\n         Life-threatening allergic reactions. Adults who have had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, a previous MMR vaccine, or a medication called neomycin should not get the vaccine.\nAs with many vaccines, the MMR vaccine works with the immune system to build up protection by putting a small amount of the virus into the body. The safest and most effective ingredients in the MMR vaccine used today include \"attenuated\" forms of each virus, which means they're live forms of the virus that have been made weak in medical labs.\nFor most adults, the benefits of the MMR vaccine outweigh the risks. A few people develop a short-term mild rash, fever, swollen glands, or pain and stiffness in the joints after getting the shot. More serious, and rare, side effects include a temporary low platelet count or serious allergic reaction.\n","276":"Pick any adult out of a crowd. The odds that he or she has had chickenpox are pretty good. But those odds are changing now that we have the chickenpox vaccine.\nThe chickenpox vaccine is a shot that can protect nearly anyone who receives the vaccine from catching chickenpox. It's also called the varicella vaccine, because chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The vaccine is made from a live but weakened, or attenuated, virus.\nViruses that have been attenuated are less virulent than viruses that are not. Although the virus in the chickenpox vaccine is generally incapable of causing a disease, it still stimulates a response from the body's immune system. That response is what gives someone who's had a shot for chickenpox immunity or protection from the illness.\nMost cases of chickenpox are relatively mild and run their course in five to 10 days. But it can be very serious, even life-threatening, in a small percentage of people. Before the varicella vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1995, there were approximately 100 deaths and more than 11,000 hospitalizations a year from chickenpox.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe risk of serious, life-threatening complications is greatest among infants, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. But anyone can develop serious complications and there is no way to predict who will.\nThere's another reason for getting a shot for chickenpox. The illness is highly contagious and can be spread by direct contact or through the air by sneezing or coughing. Also, someone can get it by coming in contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters. For that reason, children with chickenpox need to be kept out of school or day care for about a week or more until all blisters have dried and crusted over. The illness causes an itchy rash that usually forms between 200 and 500 blisters over the entire body, headaches, coughing, and fussiness. So even if the illness is mild, it still means five to 10 days of being uncomfortable.\nMost states require that children entering child care, school and even colleges and universities, show evidence of immunity to chickenpox either by having had the illness or documentation of receiving the chickenpox vaccine.\nThe chickenpox vaccine is recommended for all children under age 13 who have not had chickenpox. It is also recommended for all adolescents and adults who have not been vaccinated and have not had chickenpox.\nIf you have had chickenpox, there is no need for you to get the vaccine.\nSince 2005, the vaccine has also been available as part of a combination vaccine called MMRV, which offers protection against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.\nThe varicella vaccine is given in two doses. A child should have the first shot at ages 12-18 months. The second shot should be given at ages 4-6 years. Older children and adults should have two shots, with four to eight weeks between the first and second shot.\nAll medicines have potential side effects. But the side effects associated with the varicella vaccine are generally mild. The most common are pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site. A small percentage of people develop a mild rash, usually around the spot where the shot was given. Severe side effects are very rare.\nAnyone who is moderately to severely ill when a chickenpox shot is scheduled should wait until the illness passes before getting the shot. Also, anyone who had an allergic reaction to the first shot should not get the second shot.\nOther people who should not get the shot include:\nAbout 2% of the children who are vaccinated develop a very mild case of chickenpox, usually with no more than five to six blisters.\nIt is also possible for a person who has been vaccinated for chickenpox to develop chickenpox at some later point in life. When that happens, the disease is almost always milder and the recovery more rapid than for people who have not had the shots.\nBut it's important to keep in mind that up to 90% of the people who get the vaccine will not catch chickenpox.\n","277":"If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to conceive or already pregnant, chances are you already know about staying on top of your\u00c2\u00a0prenatal checkups\u00c2\u00a0and fitting in plenty of healthful foods, exercise and sleep. But have you talked to your doctor the vaccinations to get before and during pregnancy? You definitely should, and here's why: Pregnancy weakens the immune system to support your growing baby (who your body considers a foreigner), which means as a moms-to-be you're at greater risk of catching something and getting sicker. Plus some vaccine-preventable diseases, like whooping cough, can be very dangerous for newborn babies. And if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re considered high-risk or are traveling outside the US, you may need even more vaccinations. Other vaccines, however, are considered unsuitable, sometimes dangerous, for pregnancy. How can you keep all this info straight? Start by talking to your doctor. Then check out this guide to the vaccines you and your family should get before and during your pregnancy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d plus those you should wait to get until after you've delivered.\nDid you escape chicken pox as a child? Having avoided the calamine-soaked misery of this childhood illness may have seemed like a lucky break at the time, but now it means that you might be missing important immunity.\nHaving chickenpox as an adult can be quite serious. And if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pregnant, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not only uncomfortable, it could also spell serious trouble for your growing baby-to-be. Before you become pregnant, get checked by your doctor to see if you need the varicella vaccine (women who are already pregnant should not receive the vaccine). If blood work reveals that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not immune to chickenpox, the vaccine helps keep the pox at bay. If you have not had two doses of the chickenpox vaccine before, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need two doses, four to eight weeks apart. Then, if you can, hold off on conceiving until a month after your second dose.\nMeasles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR)\nIn addition to all three of these being very uncomfortable illnesses, rubella, (aka, German measles) can cause birth defects, while a mumps infection increases miscarriage risk and measles ups the odds of preterm birth or a low-birthweight baby. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, you can't get the MMR vaccine during pregnancy.\nKeep in mind that if your vaccination records show that you got an MMR shot when you were younger, you are considered protected for life and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever need a booster dose. However if you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t immunized according to the childhood schedule, you should get vaccinated and then wait one month before trying to conceive. Not sure whether you received the MMR vaccination and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find your vaccination records? Get the shots now, before you conceive \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even if you were vaccinated, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perfectly safe to get an additional dose.\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at high risk for this viral infection that attacks the liver (say, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a health-care worker and you come into contact with people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blood and bodily fluids, which is how hepatitis B is transmitted, or if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had more than one sex partner in the past six months), then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be wise to make sure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re up-to-date on this vaccine. Hepatitis B can be passed on to an unborn baby, and it can lead to liver failure and liver cancer. The vaccine comes in a series of three shots, but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to finish all three doses before conceiving. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe to continue with the series during pregnancy.\nInfluenza (a.k.a. the Flu) Vaccine\nThe flu vaccine helps prevent some strains of the flu, which can be very unpleasant for adults and much more serious (even deadly) to babies, small children, the elderly and anyone with a chronic medical condition or compromised immune system (including pregnant women). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all expecting women get the flu vaccine if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pregnant during the cold and flu season, preferably toward the beginning of the season, which can last from October to May. Just avoid the nasal spray, which contains live flu viruses.\nGot vaccinated last year? You should still get a new shot this (and every) year\u00e2\u20ac\u201d because immunity wanes with time, and the flu shot is reformulated every year to incorporate whichever strains doctors think will be most prevalent.\nAlso be sure to get vaccinated if you're planning to get pregnant or are caring for a small child, and make sure your little one gets vaccinated, too.\nTetanus, Diptheria and Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine\u00c2\u00a0\nTetanus is an infection caused by bacteria that can enter the body through a break in the skin. A toxin made by these bacteria cause nervous-system symptoms (such as muscle spasms and seizures). Diphtheria and pertussis (also known as whooping cough) bacteria are spread through coughing and sneezing and cause severe respiratory problems. The adult vaccine is called Tdap for protection from all three: tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough.\nAll women should get this shot between 27 to 36 weeks of each pregnancy (though if you're at risk for whooping cough due to an outbreak in your community or if you get a deep cut in your skin and are due for your tetanus booster, the vaccine is also safe to get earlier in pregnancy). When you get the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy, you pass on some immunity to help protect your newborn from whooping cough before he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s old enough to get his own vaccine, the first of which he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get at when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 months old. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important, since whooping cough is highly contagious and can be deadly for young babies, whose immune systems are still developing.\nYou may also want to talk to your doctor about getting these vaccines during pregnancy if you meet particular risk factors, such as having a chronic illness or working or traveling in places where you may be exposed to the disease:\nHepatitis B vaccine:\u00c2\u00a0The hepatitis B virus also causes liver disease and is transmitted through sexual contact, body fluids or shared hypodermic needles, and it can be present in the body for many years without showing any symptoms. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at high risk of hepatitis B (a health-care worker, dialysis patient, have had sex with more than one partner in the last six months or are traveling to a country where hep B is prevalent, including many countries in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Western Europe), you should get vaccinated during pregnancy.\nThere are several vaccines you definitely shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get during pregnancy. While in some cases there has been no definitive evidence of problems linked to these vaccines, more research needs to be done to prove they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re safe for you and your baby \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which is why doctors recommend avoiding the following vaccines while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pregnant.\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not immunized against the chickenpox virus, you should get this vaccine before you conceive. Because the vaccine contains a live virus, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not safe for women who are already pregnant. Talk to your doctor before you become pregnant if you never had chickenpox as a child or were never vaccinated as a child.\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re exposed to the varicella virus while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pregnant (your nephew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preschool class has an outbreak, say) and haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t received the vaccine, talk to the doctor about getting the varicella-zoster immune globulin, which can offer you temporary immunity and prevent complications should you come down with a case of the pox.\nLike Varicella, the MMR vaccine (which stands for Measles, Mumps and Rubella) contains live viruses, so it is not safe for women who are already pregnant. If possible, try to wait 4 weeks between receiving the vaccine and becoming pregnant.\nThe\u00c2\u00a0human papillomavirus\u00c2\u00a0(HPV) is responsible for most cervical cancers and genital warts, and the series of vaccines that protects against it has only been around for less than 10 years. Right now, the series of three vaccines are recommended for kids 9 or older and young adults up to age 26. But experts think more research is needed to make sure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe during pregnancy. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re 26 or younger, you should, however, get the vaccine after your baby is born.\nThis shot protects people from shingles \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which, like chicken pox, is caused by the varicella virus. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most common in those older than 50 and in people with certain medical issues. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much research on the effects of the vaccine on pregnant women, so doctors advise you get the shot (if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommended for you before age 60) after you deliver.\nThe CDC additionally says you should not receive the following vaccines, since not enough studies have been done on pregnant women to determine whether they're safe for baby:\u00c2\u00a0\nDo keep in mind, however, that these vaccines are safe if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re breastfeeding\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d and, if you get these shots postpartum, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pass some temporary immunity on to your baby through your breast milk.\nAnyone who takes care of or spends a lot of time with your baby \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including grandparents, siblings, caregivers, babysitters, day-care providers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d should be up-to-date on their shots, too. Make sure your partner and other relatives (and your sitter if you have one) schedule a flu vaccine, since the virus is so prevalent and the formulation changes every year. And also make sure they are up-to-date on their Tdap and Dtap vaccines, since pertussis is highly contagious, and statistics show that most babies get whooping cough from a family member.\n","278":"   \t\t   \t\tVaccination against rabies is used in two distinct situations:\nto protect those who are at risk of exposure to rabies, i.e. preexposure vaccination; \nto prevent the development of clinical rabies after exposure has occurred, usually following the bite of an animal suspected of having rabies, i.e. post-exposure prophylaxis.\n   \t\t   \t\tThe vaccines used for pre-exposure and post-exposure vaccination are the same, but the immunization schedule differs. Rabies immunoglobulin is used only for post-exposure prophylaxis. Modern vaccines of cell-culture or embryonated-egg origin are safer and more effective than the older vaccines, which were produced in brain tissue. These modern rabies vaccines are now available in major urban centres of most countries of the developing world. Rabies immunoglobulin, on the other hand, is in short supply worldwide and may not be available, even in major urban centres, in many dog rabies-infected countries.\n   \t\t   \t\tPre-exposure vaccination should be offered to people at high risk of exposure to rabies, such as laboratory staff working with rabies virus, veterinarians, animal handlers and wildlife officers, and other individuals living in or travelling to countries or areas at risk. Travellers with extensive outdoor exposure in rural areas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as might occur while running, bicycling, hiking, camping, backpacking, etc. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may be at risk, even if the duration of travel is short. Preexposure vaccination is advisable for children living in or visiting countries or areas at risk, where they provide an easy target for rabid animals. Pre-exposure vaccination is also recommended for individuals travelling to isolated areas or to areas where immediate access to appropriate medical care is limited or to countries where modern rabies vaccines are in short supply and locally available rabies vaccines might be unsafe and\/or ineffective.\n   \t\t   \t\tPre-exposure rabies vaccination consists of three full intramuscular (i.m.) doses of cell-culture- or embryonated-egg-based vaccine given on days 0, 7 and 21 or 28 (a few days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 variation in the timing is not important). For adults, the vaccine should always be administered in the deltoid area of the arm; for young children (under 1 year of age), the anterolateral area of the thigh is recommended. Rabies vaccine should never be administered in the gluteal area: administration in this manner will result in lower neutralizing antibody titres.\n   \t\t   \t\tTo reduce the cost of cell-derived vaccines for pre-exposure rabies vaccination, intradermal (i.d.) vaccination in 0.1-ml volumes on days 0, 7 and either 21 or 28 may be considered. This method of administration is an acceptable alternative to the standard intramuscular administration, but it is technically more demanding and requires appropriate staff training and qualified medical supervision. Concurrent use of chloroquine can reduce the antibody response to intradermal application of cell-culture rabies vaccines. People who are currently receiving malaria prophylaxis or who are unable to complete the entire three-dose pre-exposure series before starting malarial prophylaxis should therefore receive pre-exposure vaccination by the intramuscular route.\n   \t\t   \t\tPeriodic booster injections are not recommended for general travellers. However, in the event of exposure through the bite or scratch of an animal known or suspected to be rabid, individuals who have previously received a complete series of pre- or post-exposure rabies vaccine (with cell-culture or embryonated-egg vaccine) should receive two booster doses of vaccine. Ideally, the first dose should be administered on the day of exposure and the second 3 days later. This should be combined with thorough wound treatment (see \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Post-exposure prophylaxis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, below). Rabies immunoglobulin is not required for patients who have previously received a complete vaccination series.\n   \t\t   \t\tModern rabies vaccines are well tolerated. The frequency of minor adverse reactions (local pain, erythema, swelling and pruritus) varies widely from one report to another. Occasional systemic reactions (malaise, generalized aches and headaches) have been noted after intramuscular or intradermal injections.\nType of vaccine: Modern cell-culture or embryonated-egg vaccine\nNumber of doses: Three, one on each of days 0, 7 and 21 or 28, given i.m. (1 or 0.5 ml\/dose depending on the vaccine) or i.d. (0.1 ml\/inoculation site)a\nBooster: Not routinely needed for general travellersb\nAdverse reactions: Minor local or systemic reactions\nBefore departure: Pre-exposure prophylaxis for those planning a visit to a country or area at risk, especially if the area to be visited is far from major urban centres and appropriate care, including the availability of post-exposure rabies prophylaxis, cannot be assured.\naFor information on which vaccines are recommended for intradermal use, see:www.who.int\/rabies\/human\/postexp\/en\/index.html.\nb In the event of exposure through the bite or scratch of an animal known or suspected to be rabid, individuals who have previously received a complete series of pre-exposure or post-exposure cell-culture or embryonated-egg rabies vaccine should receive two booster doses of vaccine, the first dose ideally on the day of exposure and the second 3 days later. Rabies immunoglobulin should not be administered.\n   \t\t   \t\tIn countries or areas at risk of rabies, the circumstances of an animal bite or other contact with an animal suspected to be rabid may require post-exposure prophylaxis. In such situations, medical advice should be obtained immediately.\n   \t\t   \t\tStrict adherence to the WHO-recommended guidelines for optimal post-exposure rabies prophylaxis virtually guarantees protection from the disease. The administration of vaccine, and immunoglobulin if required, must be conducted by, or under the direct supervision of, a physician. Post-exposure prophylaxis depends on the type of contact with the confirmed or suspect rabid animal, as follows:\n   \t\t   \t\t1. Wound treatment\n   \t\t   \t\tThorough washing of the wound with soap\/detergent and water, followed by the application of ethanol or an aqueous solution of iodine or povidone.\n   \t\t   \t\t2. Passive immunization\n   \t\t   \t\tHuman rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) or equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG) or F(ab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122)2 products should be used for category III exposures as well as for some category II exposures (see table above). Passive immunization should be administered just before or shortly after administration of the first dose of vaccine given in the post-exposure prophylaxis regimen. If it is not immediately available, passive immunization can be administered up until the seventh day after initiation of the primary series of postexposure prophylaxis (with cell-culture or embryonated-egg rabies vaccine).\n   \t\t   \t\tDosage and administration: The dose for HRIG is 20 IU\/kg body weight and for ERIG and F(ab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122)2 products 40 IU\/kg body weight. The full dose of rabies immunoglobulin, or as much as is anatomically feasible, should be administered into and around the wound site. Any remainder should be injected i.m. at a site distant from the site of active vaccine administration. Multiple needle injections into the wound should be avoided. If the correct dose of rabies immunoglobulin is too small to infiltrate all wounds, as might be true of a severely bitten individual, it can be diluted in physiological buffered saline to ensure greater wound coverage.\n   \t\t   \t\t3. Active immunization\n   \t\t   \t\tCell-culture- or embryonated-egg-based rabies vaccines should always be used for post-exposure prophylaxis. They can be administered either i.m. or i.d.\n   \t\t   \t\tIntramuscular regimens: Both a five-dose and a four-dose i.m. regimen are recommended for post-exposure vaccination; the fivedose regimen is the more commonly used:\nThe five-dose regimen is administered on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 into the deltoid muscle.\nThe four-dose regimen is administered as two doses on day 0 (one dose in the right and one in the left arm (deltoid muscles), and then one dose on each of days 7 and 21 into the deltoid muscle.\n   \t\t   \t\tAn alternative post-exposure regimen for healthy, fully immunocompetent exposed people who receive wound care plus high-quality rabies immunoglobulin plus WHO-prequalified rabies vaccines consists of four doses administered i.m. on days 0, 3, 7 and 14.\n   \t\t   \t\tIntradermal regimens: Intradermal administration of cell-culture- and embryonated-egg-based rabies vaccines has been successfully used in many developing countries that cannot afford the five- or four-dose i.m. schedules.\nThe two-site i.d. method: one i.d. injection at two sites on days 0, 3, 7 and 28.\n   \t\t   \t\tThe volume per intradermal injection should be 0.1 ml with both purified Vero cell rabies vaccine, and purified chick embryo rabies vaccine.\n","279":"When people need advice about topics like health or careers, the first place they often look is the internet. The same is true when parents and caregivers are seeking credible information about whether vaccines are safe for their children. \nWHO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vaccine Safety Net \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a global network of vaccine safety websites \u00e2\u20ac\u201d provides access to accurate and trustworthy information about vaccines.\n Today, the network has 47 member websites in 12 languages. It is estimated that more than 173 million users every month access VSN websites.\nIn 2015, world leaders agreed to a new development plan\u00e2\u20ac\u201da set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and expanding access to immunisation is crucial to achieving the SDGs. Not only do vaccinations prevent the suffering and death associated with infectious diseases, they also help enable national priorities like education and economic development to take hold. \n IImportant progress have been made towards the Global Vaccine Action Plan, endorsed at the World Health Assembly in 2012, including more children being immunized worldwide, more countries are introducing new or underused vaccine, new vaccine against dengue has been licensed in several countries, and the first vaccine to protect children against malaria will be piloted in three African countries in 2018.\n Yet major challenges remain.\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo declared the end of the yellow fever outbreak following a similar announcement in Angola on 23 December 2016, bringing an end to the outbreak in both countries after no new confirmed cases were reported from both countries for the past 6 months.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are able to declare the end of one of the largest and most challenging yellow fever outbreak in recent years through the strong and coordinated response by national authorities, local health workers and partners,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nIn a revised position paper on tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccines published in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edition of the Weekly Epidemiological Record, WHO provided updated guidance on vaccination schedules for primary and booster vaccine doses, according to age and population group.  \nAll children worldwide should be immunized against tetanus. Every country should seek to achieve early and timely infant vaccination.  Other tetanus prevention efforts are also needed including individual and community education on clean wound care and the importance of following standard surgical protocols in accordance with WHO guidelines.\n","280":"The misery of a measles outbreak at the Happiest Place on Earth is an irony even the most jaded epidemiologist could do without, but the 52 cases that originated in Disneyland in December hide within them an even scarier number\u00e2\u20ac\u201dscary, that is, unless you understand how vaccines work.\nNow, plainly, most of the people stricken with Mickey Mouse measles do not understand how vaccines work, because they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get them. The vast majority of the infected were unvaccinated against the disease, including kids who were too young for the shots and anti-vaxxers who chose against them. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how you get an outbreak. But six of the cases got their measles-mumps-rubella vaccine\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe MMR shot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand still managed to get infected. And all but two of them had gotten at least two doses, the standard recommendation.\nSo what happened?\nThe measles vaccine is actually one of the most effective vaccines in the world. According to Greg Wallace, lead of the measles, mumps, rubella and polio team at the CDC, two doses are 97 percent effective against infection. (Compare that to 88 percent for two doses of the mumps vaccine from the MMR shot.) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a live version of the virus, just weakened\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor attenuated\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause severe symptoms. The vaccine replicates just like the full-on measles virus, inciting your immune system to produce antibodies against it. Those antibodies then protect against actual measles as well.\nBut in some people, that response just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. No one knows why. Either your body doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t produce enough antibodies, or the ones it does produce aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t specific enough to latch on to the virus and kill it. \nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the CDC recommends two doses of the vaccine: After the first dose, 5 to 7 percent of people won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a good enough antibody response to protect them. A second dose ensures that enough people get antibodies above that protective threshold to control the disease. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And even with two doses, you can get some failure,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Wallace, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the initial response isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t perfect, or because the response waned in some people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nSo how does that explain what happened in Disneyland? If you have a group of 1,000 people concentrated in a small space\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlike oh, say, hypothetically, an amusement park\u00e2\u20ac\u201dabout 90 percent of them will be vaccinated (hopefully). One person, maybe someone who contracted measles on a recent trip to the Philippines, moves around, spreading the virus. Measles is crazy contagious, so of the 100 people who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vaccinated, about 90 will get infected. Then, of the 900 people who are vaccinated, 3 percent\u00e2\u20ac\u201d27 people\u00e2\u20ac\u201dget infected because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have full immunity. \nNow the Disneyland numbers\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsix vaccinated infections out of the 34 cases with known records\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstart to make more sense. (And considering the 16 million or so visitors the park gets every year, we might reasonably expect that number to go up.) Once vaccination levels dip below 90 or 95 percent, there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough protected people to keep the disease in check\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe herd immunity that epidemiologists like to talk about so much. In the US, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing pretty well keeping those numbers up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there are some fluctuations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Cristina Cassetti, program officer at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and if vaccination levels dip down a little, you get a situation like Disneyland.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nSo, the tiered model of antibody response leaves a small percentage of vaccinated people susceptible. But note: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the reason why you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re better off being vaccinated even if you end up getting infected. Your antibody levels might not be high enough to completely protect you, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still help\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe CDC has seen vaccinated patients with measles who only get a rash for about an hour, says Wallace. And, importantly for octogenarians (whose immune systems are weaker) and infants, vaccinated patients are much less likely to transmit the disease to other people. Even if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the unlucky sucker who gets infected after vaccination, getting a shot still helps contribute to herd immunity\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgood job, world citizen! Taking one for the team!\nResearchers are still trying to understand why people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune systems respond differently. When they figure it out, it might help them create a more effective version of the vaccine. \nBut right now, the more important thing to focus on is vaccinating people to keep the disease from spreading like it has in Disneyland. 2014 was a banner year for the measles: 635 US residents were infected, more than the past four years combined. Without a change, those numbers will keep going up.\n","281":"Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you love when science confirms what you already knew in your gut because it is just so obvious?

Magic? Witchcraft? Nope!\nUsing some simple math, a team of infectious disease experts calculated that the vaccination rate among people who were exposed to the measles during the outbreak was no higher than 86%, and it might have been as low as 50%.\nIn order to establish herd immunity, between 96% and 99% of the population must be vaccinated, experts say.\nThe researchers did a whole bunch of calculations and science stuff, and you can read all their qualifications \u00e2\u20ac\u201d MIT is a podunk safety school, right? \u00e2\u20ac\u201d if you must, but here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the bottom line:\nthe only way to explain how the measles spread from a single person at Disneyland to 145 people in the U.S. and about a dozen others in Canada and Mexico is that a substantial number of parents have not had their children fully immunized with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clearly, MMR vaccination rates in many of the communities that have been affected by this outbreak fall well below the necessary threshold to sustain herd immunity, thus placing the greater population at risk as well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the researchers concluded.\nSo yes, anti-vaxxers, you are officially to blame for this particular outbreak.

Is it that in vaccination you are given a virus that causes a disease, but in inoculation you are given a weak form of a disease itself, not a virus which causes it? I\u00c2\u00b4m not sure if for example the following sentences are interchangeable or not:\n \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tInoculate usually carries the meaning of \"with an infectious agent\" while \"vaccination\" can be done with something that may or may not be infectious - it may be killed, attenuated or simply part of the agent (subunit vaccine, for example).  People still inoculate cell cultures and bacterial fermentations etc. specifically meaning to add the infectious agents or other living organisms so they will grow. \t\t\t\t\t\n \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tTo inoculate was origininally to graft a shoot from one type of plant to another for the purpose of providing a stronger root-stock. When Jenner introduced cowpox to humans the concept was the same; cowpox would be introduced to strengthen the response of the body against an attack of the related, but far more deadly, smallpox.\n The word vaccine, i.e. the substance that was introduced, originated somewhat later and was so called because of its cow (Latin vaccinus) origins. The verb, to vaccinate, came to indicate the method of introduction, which was to scratch the surface of the skin to achieve the result and then, the verb, by further usage, came to mean to break the skin's surface (by whatever method) and introduce cowpox.\n The whole process then became to be called vaccine inoculation (i.e. by the introduction of cowpox bacteria, to create an immunity to smallpox) which was specific to cow\/smallpox. \n As the idea caught on, vaccine was any attenuated bacterial matter given in the hopes of protecting the patient from any disease or a similar one. \n","283":"We are using cookies to give you the best experience on our site.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why most vaccines are administered into the muscle or skin tissues, and require a needle for delivery.\nSome, however, such as the oral polio vaccine are a live attenuated virus, administered as oral drops, which then stimulate an immune response in the immune cells of the gut.\nPain and fear\nResearch from Toronto shows that 24% of parents and 63% of children reported fear of needles; resulting in about 7% of children not getting vaccines when recommended.\nA recent study from the United States found that about 38% of parents were concerned about the pain from receiving so many shots.\nHPV vaccine is delivered in New Zealand schools but a number of girls who sign up for vaccine do not receive the full three doses\u00e2\u20ac\u201c fear of needles could be one of main reasons for the drop off.\nOne strategy to reduce needles has been to combine several vaccines into one shot. Even so, infants and toddlers still require several shots to complete the recommended schedule. So new needle-free technologies offer an additional solution.\nNanopatches\nDeveloped by Mark Kendall at the University of Queensland, the nanopatch involves a 1cm square of silicone with 20,000 vaccine-coated microprojections on the surface which penetrate the skin and deliver the vaccine painlessly.\nThe product is currently in the development phase, and is being tested with different vaccines.\nNasal spray vaccines\nThe nasal spray flu vaccine (also called the live attenuated influenza vaccine) is exactly what it sounds like \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0a spray you inhale to protect against seasonal influenza.\nThe nasal spray flu vaccine has been approved in some developed countries but is not available for use in Australia.\nRecently, an inhalable Ebola vaccine has been developed. It shows promising results in primates, and confirms that immunity to Ebola can be conferred through the respiratory tract.\nDry powder vaccines\nDry powder vaccines that are inhaled into the lungs are effective in initiating immune responses.\nThey have been found to fight infections in a similar way to injectable vaccinations, but have fewer side effects.\nOral vaccines\nOral vaccines are administered directly to the gastrointestinal system to induce local immunity in the lining of the gut and stimulate the immune system to fight some bacteria and viruses.\nVaccines against polio, rotavirus and cholera are commonly administered orally.\nPharmajet\nThe company Pharmajet has developed a needle-free injector for the influenza vaccine with Australian pharmaceutical company Seqirus. It uses a high pressure injector device which delivers the vaccine into the skin without a needle.\nThe rate of local side effects (such as redness and pain after vaccination), however, has been reported to be higher than standard injections.\nPharmajet injectors are available for use in the United States, but not in Australia.\nSugar microneedles\nResearchers in the United Kindom have developed a sugar disc with multiple microneedles containing dried live virus vaccine, which deliver the vaccine into the skin without a needle. Preliminary testing of this device is promising.\nEdible vaccines\nEdible vaccines are being developed, where the vaccine is delivered on an edible platform which could range from bacteria to plants. The latter includes transgenic crops, which overcome problems of vaccine storage within the cold chain, which constrain the use of traditional vaccines in low-resource settings.\nWhich vaccines to choose?\nImproving the experience of vaccination will almost certainly have a positive impact on vaccination programs. Needleless devices will also reduce the risk of needle-stick injuries to health-care workers.\nBut the choice of needles versus needle-free vaccines must also be guided by other considerations. Most importantly, needle-free vaccines must be as good or better at preventing disease.\nOther considerations include cost, production capacity (and ability to supply large population vaccine programs), storage conditions (such as temperature control), and side effects. These must all be considered and weighed up to ensure maximal individual and public health benefit of vaccines.\nAs newer vaccines become available and disease prevention targets increase, needle-free technology will become increasingly attractive.\nPublication does not imply endorsement of views by the World Economic Forum.\nTo keep up with the Agenda\u00c2\u00a0subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\nAuthors:\u00c2\u00a0C Raina MacIntyre is a\u00c2\u00a0Professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology, Head of the School of Public Health and Community Medicine at\u00c2\u00a0UNSW Australia.

By 2015, 126 countries had reached at least 90% coverage of DTP3 vaccine.\n   \t\t   \t\tHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) causes meningitis and pneumonia. Hib vaccine had been introduced in 191 countries by the end of 2015. Global coverage with 3 doses of Hib vaccine is estimated at  64%. There is great variation between regions. In the Americas, coverage is estimated at 90%, while it is only  25% and  56% in the Western Pacific and South-East Asia Regions respectively.\n   \t\t   \t\tHepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver. Hepatitis B vaccine for infants had been introduced nationwide in 185 countries by the end of 2015. Global coverage with 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine is estimated at  83% and is as high as  90% in the Western Pacific. In addition, 96 countries introduced one dose of hepatitis B vaccine to newborns within the first 24 hours of life, and the global coverage is 39%. \n   \t\t   \t\tHuman papillomavirus is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract, and can cause cervical cancer, other types of cancer, and genital warts in both men and women.

Rubella vaccine was introduced nationwide in  147 countries by the end of 2015 and global coverage was estimated at 46%.\n   \t\t   \t\tTetanus is caused by a bacterium which grows in the absence of oxygen, for example in dirty wounds or in the umbilical cord if it is not kept clean. It produces a toxin which can cause serious complications or death. The vaccine to prevent maternal and neonatal tetanus had been introduced in 106 countries by the end of 2015. An estimated 83% of newborns were protected through immunization. Maternal and neonatal tetanus persist as public health problems in 19 countries, mainly in Africa and Asia.\n   \t\t   \t\tYellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes.

Countries are aiming to achieve vaccination coverage of at least 90% nationally and at least 80% in every district by 2020. While the GVAP should accelerate control of all vaccine-preventable diseases, polio eradication is set as the first milestone. It also aims to spur research and development for the next generation of vaccines. \n   \t\t   \t\tWHO is leading efforts to support regions and countries as they adapt the GVAP for implementation. In April 2016, WHO warned that 5 out of the 6 GVAP targets were off-track, with only 1 target on the introduction of underutilized vaccines showing sufficient progress. This finding was based on the independent assessment report by SAGE. \n   \t\t   \t\tThe GVAP recommends 3 key steps for closing the immunization gap:\nintegrating immunization with other health services, such as postnatal care for mothers and babies;\nensuring that everyone can access vaccines and afford to pay for them.\n   \t\t   \t\tThe last week of April each year is marked by WHO and partners as World Immunization Week. It aims to accelerate action to increase  awareness and demand for immunization and improve vaccination delivery services so that  people everywhere can be protected against deadly diseases.\n   \t\t   \t\tIn 2016, under the global slogan \"Close the immunization gap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the campaign focused on immunization for all throughout life. .More than 180 countries, territories and areas marked the week with activities including vaccination campaigns, training workshops, round-table discussions and public information campaigns.\n","286":"Key facts\nRabies is a vaccine-preventable viral disease which occurs in more than 150 countries and territories.\nDogs are the source of the vast majority of human rabies deaths, contributing up to 99% of all rabies transmissions to humans.\nRabies elimination is feasible by vaccinating dogs.\nInfection causes tens of thousands of deaths every year, mostly in Asia and Africa.\n40% of people who are bitten by suspect rabid animals are children under 15 years of age.\nImmediate wound cleansing with soap and water after contact with a suspect rabid animal can be life-saving.\nEvery year, more than 15 million people worldwide receive a post-bite vaccination. This is estimated to prevent hundreds of thousands of rabies deaths annually.\nRabies is an infectious viral disease that is almost always fatal following the onset of clinical signs. In up to 99% of human cases, the rabies virus is transmitted by domestic dogs. Rabies affects domestic and wild animals, and is spread to people through bites or scratches, usually via saliva.\nRabies is present on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, but more than 95% of human deaths occur in Asia and Africa.\nRabies is a neglected disease of poor and vulnerable populations whose deaths are rarely reported and where human vaccines and immunoglobulin are not readily available or accessible. It occurs mainly in remote rural communities where children between the age of 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14 years are frequent victims.\nThe average cost of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can be the cost of catastrophic expenses for poor populations, since a course of PEP can cost US$ 40 in Africa and US$ 49 in Asia, where the average daily income is about US$ 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 per person.\nPrevention\nEliminating rabies in dogs\nRabies is a vaccine-preventable disease. Vaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people. Dog vaccination will drive down not only the deaths attributable to rabies but also the need for PEP as a part of dog bite patient care.\nPreventive immunization in people\nThe same safe and effective vaccines can be used for pre-exposure immunization. This is recommended for travellers spending a lot of time outdoors, especially in rural areas, involved in activities such as bicycling, camping, or hiking as well as for long-term travellers and expatriates living in areas with a significant risk of exposure to dog bites.\nPre-exposure immunization is also recommended for people in certain high-risk occupations such as laboratory workers dealing with live rabies virus and other rabies-related viruses (lyssaviruses), and people involved in any activities that might bring them professionally or otherwise into direct contact with bats, carnivores, and other mammals in rabies-affected areas. As children are considered at higher risk because they tend to play with animals, may receive more severe bites, or may not report bites, their immunization could be considered if living in or visiting high-risk areas.\nSymptoms\nThe incubation period for rabies is typically 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 months, but may vary from <1 week to >1 year, dependent upon factors such as location of rabies entry and rabies viral load. The initial symptoms of rabies are fever and often pain or an unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound site. As the virus spreads through the central nervous system, progressive, fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops.\nTwo forms of the disease can follow. People with furious rabies exhibit signs of hyperactivity, excited behaviour, hydrophobia (fear of water) and sometimes aerophobia (fear of flying). After a few days, death occurs by cardiorespiratory arrest.\nParalytic rabies accounts for about 30% of the total number of human cases. This form of rabies runs a less dramatic and usually longer course than the furious form. The muscles gradually become paralyzed, starting at the site of the bite or scratch. A coma slowly develops, and eventually death occurs. The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to the under-reporting of the disease.\nDiagnosis\nNo tests are available to diagnose rabies infection in humans before the onset of clinical disease, and unless the rabies-specific signs of hydrophobia or aerophobia are present, the clinical diagnosis may be difficult. Human rabies can be confirmed intra-vitam and post mortem by various diagnostic techniques aimed at detecting whole virus, viral antigens or nucleic acids in infected tissues (brain, skin, urine or saliva).\nTransmission\nPeople are usually infected following a deep bite or scratch by an infected animal. Dogs are the main host and transmitter of rabies. They are the cause of human rabies deaths in Asia and Africa in more than 95% of all cases.\nBats are the source of most human rabies deaths in the Americas. Bat rabies has also recently emerged as a public health threat in Australia and western Europe. Human deaths following exposure to foxes, raccoons, skunks, jackals, mongooses and other wild carnivore host species are very rare.\nTransmission can also occur when infectious material \u00e2\u20ac\u201c usually saliva \u00e2\u20ac\u201c comes into direct contact with human mucosa or fresh skin wounds. Human-to-human transmission by bite is theoretically possible but has never been confirmed.\nRarely, rabies may be contracted by inhalation of virus-containing aerosol or via transplantation of an infected organ. Ingestion of raw meat or other tissues from animals infected with rabies is not a confirmed source of human infection.\nPost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)\nPost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) means the treatment of a bite victim that is started immediately after exposure to rabies in order to prevent rabies from entering the central nervous system which would result in imminent death. This consists of:\nlocal treatment of the wound, initiated as soon as possible after exposure;\na course of potent and effective rabies vaccine that meets WHO standards; and\nthe administration of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG), if indicated.\nEffective treatment soon after exposure to rabies can prevent the onset of symptoms and death.\nLocal treatment of the wound\nThis involves first-aid of the wound that includes immediate and thorough flushing and washing of the wound for a minimum of 15 minutes with soap and water, detergent, povidone iodine or other substances that kill the rabies virus.\nRecommended PEP\nDepending on the severity of the contact administering with the suspected rabid animal, administration of PEP is recommended as follows (see table):\nTable: Categories of contact and recommended post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)\nCategories of contact with suspect rabid animal\nPost-exposure prophylaxis measures\nCategory I \u00e2\u20ac\u201c touching or feeding animals, licks on intact skin\nNone\nCategory II \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches or abrasions without bleeding\nImmediate vaccination and local treatment of the wound\nCategory III \u00e2\u20ac\u201c single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches, licks on broken skin; contamination of mucous membrane with saliva from licks, contacts with bats.\nImmediate vaccination and administration of rabies immunoglobulin; local treatment of the wound\nAll category II and III exposures assessed as carrying a risk of developing rabies require PEP. This risk is increased if:\nthe biting mammal is a known rabies reservoir or vector species;\nthe animal looks sick or displays an abnormal behaviour;\na wound or mucous membrane was contaminated by the animal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saliva;\nthe bite was unprovoked; and\nthe animal has not been vaccinated.\nIn developing countries, the vaccination status of the suspected animal alone should not be considered when deciding whether to initiate prophylaxis or not.\nWHO continues to promote human rabies prevention through the elimination of rabies in dogs as well as a wider use of the intradermal route for PEP which reduces volume and thereby the cost of cell-cultured vaccine by 60% to 80%.\nWHO response\nRabies, a zoonotic disease, requires close co-ordination between animal and human health sectors at the national, regional and continental levels.\nIn December 2015, a global framework to reach zero human rabies deaths by 2030 was launched by WHO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations (FAO) and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control. This initiative marks the first time that the human and animal health sectors have come together to adopt a common strategy against this devastating but massively neglected disease.\nGreat strides have been made in the Philippines, South Africa and Tanzania where proof of concept projects as part of a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation project led by WHO recently showed that a decrease in human rabies is possible through a combination of interventions involving dog vaccination, improved access to PEP, and increased surveillance and public awareness raising. The key towards sustaining and expanding the rabies programmes to new territories and countries has been to start small, demonstrate success and cost-effectiveness, and ensure community engagement.\nStockpiles of dog and human rabies vaccine have had a catalytic effect on rabies elimination efforts. WHO is working to assemble forecasts on the supply of human and dog vaccines and the need for rabies immunoglobulin, to understand the global manufacturing capacity and to explore bulk purchasing options for countries through WHO\/UNICEF (human vaccine and RIG) and OIE\/WHO (animal vaccine) mechanisms.\nThe use of stimulus packages consisting of technical and material support to kick-start rabies prevention programs for endemic countries and regions has proven successful. By enabling the implementation of proven control strategies, these create sustainable rabies elimination programs and could ideally be expanded to neighbouring regions and countries.\nRabies transmitted by dogs has been eliminated in many Latin American countries, including Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, Uruguay, most of Argentina, the states of S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, and large parts of Mexico and Peru.\nMany countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region have embarked on elimination campaigns in line with the target of regional elimination by 2020. Bangladesh launched an elimination programme in 2010 and, through the management of dog bites, mass dog vaccination and increased availability of vaccines free of charge, human rabies deaths decreased by 50% during 2010\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2013.\nFor more information contact:\n","287":"WHO | Measles containing vaccine 1st dose (MCV1) immunization coverage\n","288":"1. With adequate levels of hygiene, sanitation and clean water, is there still a need for vaccination?\n   \t\t   \t\tVaccines are necessary \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and good hygiene, sanitation, clean water, and nutrition are insufficient for stopping infectious diseases. If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t maintain optimum rates of immunization or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herd immunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the diseases prevented by vaccination will return. While better hygiene, sanitation and clean water help protect people from infectious diseases, many infections can spread regardless of how clean we are. If people are not vaccinated, diseases that have become uncommon such as pertussis (whooping cough), polio and measles, will quickly reappear.\n2. Are vaccines safe? \n   \t\t   \t\tVaccines are safe. Any licensed vaccine is rigorously tested across multiple phases of trials before it is approved for use, and regularly reassessed once it is on the market. Scientists are also constantly monitoring information from several sources for any sign that a vaccine may cause an adverse event. Most vaccine reactions are usually minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. In the rare event a serious side effect is reported, it is immediately investigated.  \n   \t\t   \t\tIt is far more likely to be seriously injured by a vaccine-preventable disease than by a vaccine. For example, in the case of polio, the disease can cause paralysis, measles can cause encephalitis and blindness, and some vaccine-preventable diseases can even result in death. While any serious injury or death caused by vaccines is one too many, the benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the risks, and many more illness and deaths would occur without vaccines.\n   \t\t   \t\tVaccines interact with the immune system to produce an immune response similar to that produced by the natural infection, but they do not cause the disease or put the immunized person at risk of its potential complications. In contrast, the price paid for getting immunity through natural infection might be mental retardation from Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), birth defects from rubella, liver cancer from hepatitis B virus, or death from complication due to measles.\n   \t\t   \t\tAlthough vaccine-preventable diseases have become uncommon in many countries, the infectious agents that cause them continue to circulate in some parts of the world. In a highly inter-connected world, they can cross geographical borders and infect anyone who is not protected. In Western Europe, for example, measles outbreaks have occurred in unvaccinated populations in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and United Kingdom, and in the United States. \n   \t\t   \t\tTwo key reasons to get vaccinated are to protect ourselves and to protect those around us. Successful vaccination programmes depend on the cooperation of every individual to ensure the wellbeing of all. We should not rely on people around us to stop the spread of disease; we, too, must do what we can.\n5. Can a child be given more than one vaccine at a time?\n   \t\t   \t\tScientific evidence shows that giving several vaccines at the same time has no negative effect on a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system. Children are exposed to several hundred foreign substances that trigger an immune response every day. The simple act of eating food introduces new antigens into the body, and numerous bacteria live in the mouth and nose. A child is exposed to far more antigens from a common cold or sore throat than they are from vaccines.  \n   \t\t   \t\tThe key advantage of having several vaccines at once is fewer clinic visits, which saves time and money. Also, when a combined vaccination is possible (e.g. for measles, mumps and rubella), that will result in fewer injections and reduces discomfort for the child. A number of steps can also be taken to minimise the pain of the multiple injections.\n   \t\t   \t\tInfluenza is a serious disease that kills between 300 000 to 500 000 people worldwide every year. Pregnant women, small children, elderly people with poor health and anyone with a chronic condition, like asthma or heart disease, are at higher risk for severe infection and death. Vaccinating pregnant women has the added benefit of protecting their newborns (there is currently no vaccine for babies under 6 months).  \n   \t\t   \t\tSeasonal influenza vaccines offer immunity to the 3 most prevalent strains circulating in any given season. It is the best way to reduce your chances of severe flu and of spreading it to others. Avoiding the flu means avoiding extra medical care costs and lost income from missing days of work or school.\n   \t\t   \t\tThiomersal is an organic, mercury-containing compound added to some vaccines as a preservative. It is safe and the most widely-used preservative for vaccines that are provided in multi-dose vaccine vials. There is no evidence to suggest that the amount of thiomersal used in vaccines poses a health risk.\n   \t\t   \t\tThe 1998 study which raised concerns about a possible link between measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism was later found to be seriously flawed and fraudulent. The paper was subsequently retracted by the journal that published it. Unfortunately, its publication set off a panic that led to dropping immunization rates, and subsequent outbreaks of these diseases. There is no evidence of a link between MMR vaccine and autism or autistic disorders.\n","289":"The GVIRF is a unique Forum in the field of vaccines & immunization.

Health officials suspect an infected traveler, who caught the virus overseas, visited the theme park and exposed others.\nThe outbreak sickened 147 people in the U.S., including 131 in California. No deaths were reported.\nThe California Department of Public Health on Friday declared the outbreak over after no new cases appeared in the last 42 days, or two incubation periods.\nHOW IT STARTED\nThe identity of the person responsible for spreading measles at Disney theme parks in Southern California will likely forever remain a mystery. Because there haven't been homegrown measles cases in the U.S. for more than a decade, health experts believe the virus came from abroad where the airborne disease is still common.\nThe outbreak probably began with a cough or sneeze. Measles is highly contagious and spreads easily through the air and in closed spaces. Infected droplets can linger for up to two hours after the sick person leaves.\nHOW IT SPREAD\nHealth officials said 42 people were exposed to measles while visiting or working at Disneyland in December. More than two dozen family members or close friends fell ill after coming into contact with the initial cases.\nOther places were hit with the virus, including hospitals, malls, airports and schools. About 20 percent of patients were hospitalized.\nThere were cases where the source was unknown. Because the measles strain was the same, health officials consider them part of the Disneyland outbreak.\nWHY IT GOT ATTENTION\nMeasles outbreaks are relatively rare in the U.S. Past outbreaks mainly occurred in communities with low vaccination rates.\nThe Disneyland outbreak occurred at a major tourist destination filled with visitors from around the globe. People who were infected at the theme parks then traveled home with the virus, where it continued to spread.\nDisease investigators tracked down thousands of people potentially exposed to measles. Those considered at-risk received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Sick patients were asked to place themselves in isolation until the infectious period passed. Schools sent unvaccinated students home.\nHealth experts said the quick response prevented the outbreak from getting worse.\n\"They did a tremendous job,\" said Dr .James Cherry, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nThe outbreak cast a spotlight on the anti-vaccine movement. Parents who oppose vaccines for their children for personal reasons found themselves on the defensive.\nAs infections mounted, several state legislatures tried to make it harder for parents to opt out of vaccinations.\nIn California, a bill that would prevent parents from seeking vaccine exemptions for their children because of personal beliefs generated heated discussion in Sacramento. A vote was delayed until next week.\nContact the reporter at:
